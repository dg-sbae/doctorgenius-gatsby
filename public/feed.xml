Oftentimes, a single search creates millions of results, but a user is probably not going to look past the first page (or even past the first half of the first page). Whether or not your website appears in the top five slots of that page depends on its organic ranking. Your website’s chances of being found in a Google search go up with a better ranking, but how do you boost its performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Raising your doctor online ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to increase a website’s ranking through refined online practice management techniques. First, check your website’s current organic ranking on Google and other search engines. This can give you a starting point, and keeping track of this information can tell you which of these four methods generate the greatest improvement in ranking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Identify relevant keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keywords are a huge part of healthcare digital marketing today. These are a specific word or short phrase that a user types into a search engine. If Google sees that the same or similar keywords appear in your content, your website is more likely to rank higher in the search results. To find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2020/09/21/15-proven-tips-for-building-an-effective-keyword-list/?sh=3bc38a4c5297&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2020/09/21/15-proven-tips-for-building-an-effective-keyword-list/?sh=3bc38a4c5297&quot;&gt;right keywords&lt;/a&gt; for your content, try typing in some that are relevant to your field to see what content they already bring up. Use tools such as Google Trends to identify options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Make your website easier to read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formatting and readability can make a huge difference in how much time a user spends on a site. Websites that have difficult readability or that are formatted poorly are more likely to quickly lose users. The longer a person stays on your site, the better it is ranked. Check that every page is clean and neat and is not crowded with too much information. A majority of people access the internet on a phone, so your site also needs to be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/designing-a-site-for-mobile-users/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/designing-a-site-for-mobile-users/&quot;&gt;function perfectly on a mobile device&lt;/a&gt; as well as a desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Generate unique and descriptive page titles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every page on your site needs to have a concise title and a short title tag that presents a snippet of the page’s content. Try to place a keyword in the title as close to the beginning as possible. Keep the title tag under 60 characters and include the primary keyword, the company&amp;#8217;s name, and an alternative title to the page or article, which appear as the title readers see on search engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Create engaging content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it is the content on your website that will keep users there the longest. Content needs to be fresh, intriguing, and top quality. Blogging regularly is a great way to constantly keep users engaged and returning to your site. Generating content on a weekly or monthly basis allows you to put more keywords throughout your website and attract more people to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

Posting new content to your site regularly is a fantastic way to keep current patients interested in your material and up to date on your business. It is also one of the most effective ways to generate a better SEO ranking in search engines like Google. Why does this matter? A majority of potential patients are likely to search for your medical services in a search engine, and they can find you considerably easier if your site ranks higher in SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fresh healthcare content and SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search engine optimization has become a key part of every successful website today. Organic searches (keywords that people type into a search engine to find a relative website) usually make up half of total site traffic and often result in more paying patients than sites that rely heavily on traditional ad campaigns. To create a website that gets clicked on after a search on Google, your site needs to be one of the top results on the first page. You can achieve this goal by posting frequently and updating your medical SEO content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Posting brand-new content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the simplest ways to boost your SEO rank is by posting new content. This is often easier said than done. Posting regularly requires dedication, time, and creativity, but it can pay off phenomenally in the long run. Websites with a blog have far more indexed pages than those that do not, and Google’s algorithm views these sites as having valuable, fresh information that deserve higher rankings, allowing them to reach more online users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to how much you should post to fully optimize SEO, there is no single answer. Generally, being consistent with how often you post is more valuable than the actual number of times you do so. Even just blogging monthly can create a steady audience for your website. To truly discover what frequency works best, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-use-analytics-to-view-online-ranking/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-use-analytics-to-view-online-ranking/&quot;&gt;use tools like Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; to discover the right frequency and time of day to post to bring in the most new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Updating old content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, constantly posting new content is not your only option to improve SEO. You can take advantage of old posts by revamping and revitalizing content. Most posts have a lifespan of two to three years, with some always staying on top because the material is consistently relevant. To get Google to give your old posts new, improved rankings, simply update them with new information and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doctor Genius can help your SEO ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we offer tier plans that provide the right services to improve your site’s SEO through regularly posted content. Our gold and platinum tiers offer the most posts, generating new content to build your site’s authority and increase ranking. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the benefits of each tier and discover the right one for your site.

However, with 330 million users, 69 million of which are in the United State according to a study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/242606/number-of-active-twitter-users-in-selected-countries/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/242606/number-of-active-twitter-users-in-selected-countries/&quot;&gt;statista.com&lt;/a&gt;, failing to use Twitter for medical content marketing is a big misstep. Twitter is ideal for reaching new patients, promoting information about your practice, and driving more traffic to your website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips for tweets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, tweeting out links to new blog posts on your website is not enough to bring in new traffic. Like all social media platforms, certain marketing strategies work better than others on this media giant. Here are five tips to get the most out of a business Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Promote links directly in a tweet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraging more Twitter users to explore your website begins by providing links to content in short tweets. Tweets that are concise and intriguing are more likely to attract interest than longer ones. Consider writing tweets that are less than 100 characters (though Twitter allows up to 280). Present a question, write a call to action, or include an engaging quote from the content you are promoting that makes users want to click on the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Place a link in your bio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to tweets, you can include a link to a website in your Twitter bio. The bio appears at the top of your profile page, offering a quick opportunity to present who you are to new patients. Many businesses take advantage of the bio by pitching services and interests. In this area, you may also include a link to anywhere on your website. If you have an official landing page specifically for new patients, the bio is a great place to drop a link to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Include hashtags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hashtags are a fantastic way to generate interest in your content and connect with other users who share similar interests. In short, hashtags are specific words or key phrases that are placed after a # within a tweet. To attract the right audience and establish &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/&quot;&gt;strong SEO&lt;/a&gt;, either create special hashtags that apply to your practice or include hashtags that others are already using to link your content to a larger conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Try facts and statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the most engaging content on Twitter, facts, studies, and statistics top the list. Including a sneak peek at a new study or mentioning an interesting fact in a tweet is a great way to get someone to click on a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Use plenty of pictures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To catch the attention of users who quickly scan through their Twitter feed, try including interesting pictures that are relevant to your content. Pictures can make users pause as they scroll. This increases the chance that they will engage with the tweet by reading the content and clicking on links.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a way to be more regularly active on your social media platforms without exerting extra effort, saving you valuable time. However, because most social media sites run on different formats with different goals, cross-posting is not always a sound strategy. Posting an identical message on both Facebook and Twitter can have negative effects on your medical content marketing; such duplication simply does not work in today’s buzzing world of social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When to cross-post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing over social media for doctors is no different than marketing for any other business. You need to take the time to determine how each media platform’s audience scans and digests information and how to optimize your posts so they reach the most people. Understanding how to effectively cross-post between platforms is as essential as knowing when you simply need new content among your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The harm of posting identical content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every social media platform provides a different experience for users and usually caters to different audiences. For example, statista.com reports that males between the ages of 25 and 34 make up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/&quot;&gt;largest demographic on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, but users above the age of 40 are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/246172/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-linkedin-by-age-group/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20third%20quarter,25%20years%20did%20the%20same.&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/246172/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-linkedin-by-age-group/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20third%20quarter,25%20years%20did%20the%20same.&quot;&gt;largest group on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. A message posted on Facebook aimed at younger users is not going to have the same impact with users on LinkedIn, and the same goes for Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest. In fact, slapping identical content across all of your accounts can lose current patients instead of gaining more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The benefit of cross-promoting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though cross-posting can negatively impact your image on social media, you can still promote identical content from your website — you only need to change how the information is presented across the platforms. Every time you have a new blog post or new page you want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/&quot;&gt;share with patients&lt;/a&gt; and online followers, create a separate promotion for each media account that fits the audience and format. To post on Twitter, make sure your message is concise and under 280 characters. On Instagram, include a high-quality image and a fun or insightful story to go with it. Changing up similar content can lead more users back to your website from every social site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to effectively cross-promote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are ready to promote new content, sit down and write a brief summary (a few sentences should do) of what you want current and potential patients to know about the content. Then incorporate that summary into a different post for each platform, making sure to abide by character limits, audience constraints, and general guidelines. If you find that one type of post works particularly well on a certain site, continue using it as a template for future posts on that site. Once you get a feel for what posts work better on each site, writing promotions becomes much easier and takes less time.&lt;/p&gt;

For others, however, it did little to sway their enthusiasm for SMM. If anything, it bolstered it, as those organizations realized that what value they could derive from social would only increase as their competition dropped off the channels. What kind of value, though, did those marketers recognize that others did not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The value of dental social media marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media content and engagement may not directly impact your dental practice’s rankings in search, but that does not mean you should forego an SMM campaign entirely. Below are a few reasons to invest in an SMM strategy in 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nearly 50% of the world’s population — or nearly 4 billion people — have active social media accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;54% of social media users use social media to research products or services.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The average person logs into Facebook at least nine times a day and spends between 2.5 and three hours on social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your audience is on social media, and members are using it to guide their purchase decisions — two major reasons you should make SMM part of your dental digital marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social channels your dental practice should not ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with the before-mentioned data, you may be ready to make SMM part of your dentist SEO strategy. However, before you do, know that more is not always better. It is important that you focus your efforts on the channels most popular and widely used with your particular audience; otherwise, they may fall flat. Though the most effective platforms will vary from practice to practice, a few are more popular than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 70% of Americans use Facebook and, of those, approximately three-quarters of active users check their accounts daily. The largest percentage of users at 61% are Americans between the ages of 25 and 61, which is the target demographic for many dental professionals. As an advertising platform, Facebook is great for lead generation as it allows you to create customized ads and target them to a very specific audience. It is also a great platform on which you can build relationships and turn followers into loyal customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pinterest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a visually driven platform, Pinterest is a great place to showcase before and after photos. Pinterest’s audience consists mostly of women — or, more specifically, moms. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hootsuite.com/pinterest-statistics-for-business/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://blog.hootsuite.com/pinterest-statistics-for-business/&quot;&gt;the data&lt;/a&gt;, 80% of Pinterest users are women between the age of 18 and 64 with children. Moreover, more than 90% of users browse the platform with the intent to make a purchase. If you want to target the decision-makers of the family, Pinterest is the platform on which to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a great platform on which to publish announcements, important messages, deals, breaking news, and other time-sensitive information. Most Twitter users are under the age of 50 and prefer short, digestible snippets of textual content, such as listicles, articles, and quotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work with Doctor Genius to identify effective marketing channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though social media may not impact your rankings in search directly, SMM is still a crucial component of any effective &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/&quot;&gt;content marketing campaign&lt;/a&gt; — especially during this era of social distancing.

It allows practices to become more visible in high-traffic areas online. There is more than meets the eye on these forums, and understanding the useful features may help raise your practice&amp;#8217;s online presence. Doing this can ultimately net you more website views and potential clients. Find out how to raise your healthcare SEO by creating a calendar to post content to your practice&amp;#8217;s social media accounts automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medical practice marketing using social media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have become reliant on social media for providing insight into potential products and services. Hashtags have become a starting point for everything from news articles to reviews. Using hashtags and SEO keywords in blog posts makes it more likely that your content is seen. The more relevant and engaging content you post, the higher your webpage views can climb and yield new clients for your practice. Creating content to post across social media allows your practice to harness the power of social engagement to engage potential clients and drive business to your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning a content calendar for doctors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/&quot;&gt;Creating content for your practice&lt;/a&gt; should be a priority if you wish to grow. It is important that blog posts are put up with some regularity. This ensures your practice continues to appear high in SEO rankings on social media. Finding an effective way to post content frequently may come down to using a social media calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Promote your practice regularly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You use a calendar to plan your day and schedule patients. It allows you to see upcoming events and ensure that you have the necessary tools well in advance. The same logic applies to a social media calendar. This tool allows you to plan your practice&amp;#8217;s blogs in advance and have them automatically posted on the days and times you choose. Scheduling posts helps you to maximize timing trends for social media users. Utilize a social media calendar for your practice to provide a steady stream of insight to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capitalize on healthcare trends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up with relevant topics may be one of the most difficult parts of writing blog posts. You want to create engaging posts that drive traffic to your practice&amp;#8217;s website from social media outlets. A calendar can help with content planning by allowing you to capitalize on relevant &lt;a href=&quot;https://nationaltoday.com/health-holidays/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://nationaltoday.com/health-holidays/&quot;&gt;healthcare awareness days&lt;/a&gt;. Blog posts centered around these medical topics and how they relate back to your practice can be written on your timetable but set to post on social media during the relevant dates. This ultimately raises the practice&amp;#8217;s visibility during these times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let our content creators help!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you do not have the in-house resources to create a steady stream of content for your blog and social media pages. That is where our creative team at Doctor Genius comes in.

In today&amp;#8217;s world where many potential patients choose a medical practice based on the online reviews of previous patients, it is critical to know how to handle negative reviews. Learning about patient review management can help you not only deal with poor reviews but also grow your practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How reviews affect search engine rankings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithm Google uses when someone searches for your practice pulls reviews from many platforms such as Yelp, Google, and Facebook. While one bad review on Google may not be enough to disrupt your ranking, one patient who leaves a negative review across multiple platforms can cause your ranking to fall. All it takes is a few patients with a negative perception of your practice to leave reviews on several websites, and your ranking, as well as the reputation and credibility of your practice, can suffer. Because of this, it is critical to handle poor reviews quickly and professionally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turning negative reviews into a positive patient experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2012/03/bad-reviews-can-boost-sales-heres-why&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2012/03/bad-reviews-can-boost-sales-heres-why&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;, bad reviews can actually be good for business when handled correctly. Here is how this can be accomplished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Respond to the review in a timely manner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring a negative review is the worst thing you can do. Silence only reinforces the patient&amp;#8217;s perception that you and your practice do not care about them. However, it is equally important to plan your response carefully and understand the patient&amp;#8217;s situation before responding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Properly assess the situation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the time to figure out what went wrong can not only allow you to respond appropriately but also help you prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Ask questions of your staff about what was said or done that perhaps could have been misinterpreted. If there is any recorded correspondence, such as phone calls, voice mails, or emails, listen to or read through those to better understand what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make the situation right&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a bad review is handled correctly, it shows your dedication to patient experience and care. It can be reassuring for potential patients to understand that if there are any incidents during an appointment or procedure, they will be taken seriously and dealt with correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Express your gratitude to the customer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every unhappy patient is an opportunity to make your practice better. Many times, patients who have a poor experience never take the time to leave a review. Rather, they will avoid your practice or speak poorly of it to others. By leaving a review, the patient gives you the chance to make things right and earn back their trust. Saying thank you to a patient is a wonderful way to bring closure to a potentially disruptive situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improve your online presence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an increasing number of people looking at online reviews and top-ranked business listings, strategic SEO for medical practices can have a tremendous impact on your practice. Our trained team members at Doctor Genius are here to help you improve not only your Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/&quot;&gt;ranking&lt;/a&gt; but also your social media presence, website maintenance, and more.

There are many areas this type of lawyer can help with in addition to litigation, and having a trusted lawyer before you need one can eliminate the stress associated with having to scramble to locate one on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ways to find a trusted professional dental lawyer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to confidential matters and issues that could have a tremendous impact on your practice, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebusiness.ada.org/assets/docs/6850.PDF?OrderID=2104406&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://ebusiness.ada.org/assets/docs/6850.PDF?OrderID=2104406&quot;&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt; recommends choosing your lawyer carefully. Here are methods to use when deciding on a lawyer for your dental practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consult online resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest advantages of using a search engine like Google as you begin your query is the ability to see reviews from previous clients. Although some opinions may be a bit extreme, reviews can typically provide a general overview of how professional and successful a lawyer has been in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take advantage of your network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odds are good you know someone at another practice who has used a dental lawyer before, a friend or relative who is a lawyer in this area, or experience with dental law. Be bold about asking peers for a referral. People are not likely to recommend someone to you unless they know that person will do a good job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use a lawyer referral service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many state and local bar associations often have a lawyer referral service. The lawyers these services refer people to are generally well known and respected in their communities and have a proven track record of success. If this is the route you choose to go, it is more about picking the lawyer who is the right fit for your practice than having to decide whether the lawyer is competent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ask your malpractice carrier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because all operating medical practices should have a malpractice carrier, this option is relatively simple. You should already have a representative and a phone number or email address handy. Contact your malpractice representative and ask about respected lawyers who have handled cases similar to yours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Talk to your state dental association&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some state dental associations have approved referral lists of law firms and attorneys. Because these lists typically include lawyers from all over the state, it is important to be aware of the location of the lawyers you are most interested in. If you need legal advice in a specialized area, make sure to ask what kind of experience the lawyer has in that area specifically. &lt;/p&gt;

Knowing exactly who you are and what you are about as a practice can be a key element to creating and communicating a strong brand presence and increasing your appeal to potential patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know what makes your practice unique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason why you decided to run your own practice. Considering this can help you better understand what defines your brand. The &amp;#8220;why&amp;#8221; behind your process can make your practice more appealing to patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identify your personality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out your personality and company culture as a practice can make it more relatable to your target patients. Do you have an older staff, play soft music, and keep many plants around the office? This personality could be more suited to senior generations. Decisions about office staff and ambiance should not be arbitrary but part of your strategy to communicate your brand and gain patient loyalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Define your voice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every practice has a brand voice, whether it is intentionally or unintentionally conveyed. Everything from the demeanor of your staff to the language used on your website sets the tone for your patients&amp;#8217; experience. Is your voice encouraging and empowering? Informative and friendly? Professional and ambitious? Knowing how you want to be perceived by your patients can help you determine which voice to use and be purposeful in expressing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a visual identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with language, the way your office and website look can have a tremendous impact on your brand. Do they have a modern, edgy appearance or a classic, comfortable feel? Everything from the color of the paint and the pictures on the walls to the layout of your webpage communicates the brand of your practice. Tailoring the design of your office and website to appeal to your target patients can help entice them to visit your office as well as make them feel comfortable while there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understand the benefits of branding for patients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, the right branding can help you make a lasting first impression that can both attract new clients and impress the ones you have. When you clearly communicate the type of practice you run and what makes it special, it takes that guesswork out of the equation for patients and can put them at ease about visiting your office for the first time. The more comfortable patients feel about their visit, the more likely they are to have a positive experience and become loyal patients for life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reach target patients more effectively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Doctor Genius team knows gaining and retaining patients is the lifeblood of your practice. We can help you identify and clearly communicate your brand so your marketing is more effective and you can spend more time caring for your patients than you do trying to get new ones.

To effectively strengthen your medical practice’s credibility and expertise in your field, focus your efforts on improving your site’s SEO and developing your brand both online and in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to increase authority online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about a company’s authority, it helps to think of this term as having a two-fold meaning. In one sense, the word “authority” indicates whether a medical practice is seen as a leader in its field that consumers can readily trust and rely on due to significant expertise and experience. However, in the world of digital marketing, companies are also concerned with website authority, which is closely connected with the site’s SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SEO and website authority&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main factors search engines consider when producing the search engine results pages for a specific keyword or topic is how trustworthy and well-regarded each website is. The more credible and popular the site, the more likely it is to rank high on the SERP. While there is some level of obscurity even among experts on every feature search engines consider when determining these rankings, there are several factors every company should consider when first creating or enhancing a website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Content: &lt;/strong&gt;While a polished website that neatly lists your practice’s services and contact location is a good start, creating high-quality, relevant content through &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; and other information content can help guide qualified leads to your site and increase your overall authority for SEO.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backlinks: &lt;/strong&gt;Using backlinks to other websites in your content and in turn being linked to on others’ websites are another important way to boost authority. When link building, carefully monitor which sites link to your content. Sites that have low authority can actually hurt your website’s SEO and should be &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en&quot;&gt;disavowed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviews: &lt;/strong&gt;Having a large number of positive reviews, especially those with well-crafted descriptions, can have a positive effect on potential patients and boost your SEO. For Google, make sure your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/business/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.google.com/business/&quot;&gt;Google My Business&lt;/a&gt; account is fully set up, and take time to review and respond to any reviews that are left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to increase real-world authority&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an authority medical site is more likely to rank higher on search engines, your practice’s authority extends beyond online presence. Make sure your business is well-branded and as clean and polished in person as it looks on your website. Strive to be a leader in your field, seeking opportunities to be innovative and to offer niche services that set you apart from the competition. Maintain open lines of communication and stay active on social media, taking care to address any questions and concerns from current and potential patients. Use opportunities as they present themselves to establish your expertise in your field of study, whether that means publishing content, creating instructional videos, or taking part in presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn how digital marketing can help you increase authority&lt;/h2&gt;

Ron has worked with Doctor Genius for over 7 years as the Director of Production, managing a team of 22 and overseeing more than 820 active client websites. He has previously completed projects for globally-renowned companies such as Microsoft, The Walt Disney Company, IBM, and General Motors.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span &gt;The Problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Google’s primary goal is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/original-high-quality-photography-boosts-consumer-confidence/&quot;&gt;protect and satisfy the consumer by providing accurate results&lt;/a&gt; within business searches. As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span &gt;Stock Photos Don’t Work &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063&quot;&gt;&lt;span &gt;Google My Business Help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span &gt;, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proper storefront signage - Zara Example&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span &gt;Phone Numbers and Addresses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Business Center Directory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span &gt;Solutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span &gt;Solutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This group of representatives will allow more insight from your team about what they think about the company&amp;#8217;s culture. Implementing an engagement committee can help take the guesswork out of employee satisfaction and provide valuable information about improving your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improving Employee Satisfaction and Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/06/22/employee-engagement-what-and-why/?sh=2bb31807f372&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/06/22/employee-engagement-what-and-why/?sh=2bb31807f372&quot;&gt;Forbes &lt;/a&gt;defines employee engagement as the emotional commitment an employee has to an organization and its goals. Establishing this group can be an excellent way to improve communication between leadership and the rest of the staff while increasing the commitment employees have to their workplace. Engagement committees help promote a healthy working environment by facilitating networking and exchanging ideas to improve employee satisfaction and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Giving Everyone a Voice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most practices have employees who do excellent work behind the scenes but are not necessarily involved in decision-making processes. It can be easy for ideas from this demographic to go unheard. These employees are important because they are often the ones that can point out better processes, improve patient relations, or cut costs. Voicing opinions also allows employees to build intrinsic motivators and create a sense of trust and belonging. Engagement committees give these employees a way to suggest ideas and help make the business better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Employees&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps employees feel uncomfortable approaching the leadership with questions or concerns. Or they may be concerned about maintaining an appropriate work-life balance. While it is possible to get some insight from employee surveys, an engagement committee can provide more context and understanding to the way employees feel and think. Knowing the reasons behind such employee sentiment is also essential to creating any positive change within the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Address Employee Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, employees leave a job without providing the real reason they were unhappy. Having an engagement committee can reveal the source of the problem and allow the company to address it quickly. Taking action can prevent the employee from leaving and help prevent other employees from quitting for the same reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bring Unknown Issues to Light&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower-level employees frequently have concerns that go unvoiced. When these concerns go unaddressed, operations are less productive than they could be, and employee morale is lower than it should be. Having an engagement committee can help solve such issues efficiently and keep employees feeling &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-new-normal-how-to-keep-your-teams-engaged-and-motivated/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-new-normal-how-to-keep-your-teams-engaged-and-motivated/&quot;&gt;connected and motivated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Google Trust Signals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Google TrustRank allows Google to assess trust signals and combat web spam by evaluating whether these signals are legitimate. Trust signals are online elements displayed by businesses or brands that automatically assure consumers of their authenticity. Logos, guarantee symbols, social proofs, and membership stamps are all examples of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaldoughnut.com/articles/2019/july/10-important-trust-signals-for-ecommerce&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;qualified trust signals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Patients who find trust symbols on business sites are more likely to click through or initiate contact as they provide an alternative to fall back on if the consumer is unsatisfied. Original photos qualify as trust signals as they communicate authenticity and, if authenticated by Google, receive an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/google-trustrank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“assignee” attachment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to Google.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Having the right human resource standards<a class="moretag" href="/how-small-practices-handle-hr/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-small-practices-handle-hr/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-small-practices-handle-hr/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 20:00:08 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult for small practices to navigate the world of human resources. Having the right human resource standards in place is an essential part of running a business and taking care of employees. Here are some ways to make sure your practice is compliant with all the human resources rules and regulations that impact your employee relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating a Safe and Enjoyable Workplace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of ensuring that a practice has a safe and enjoyable workplace for employees is knowing and following all employment laws. There are regulations for all aspects of employee hiring, retention, and termination processes. Information is accessible in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.employmentlawhandbook.com/federal-employment-and-labor-laws/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.employmentlawhandbook.com/federal-employment-and-labor-laws/&quot;&gt;Federal Employee Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, and additional updates to local and federal regulations are available in newsletters and websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attracting and Hiring Quality Employees&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small practices can also benefit from effective hiring processes. HR can manage the risks during the hiring process and reduce the probability of a bad hire. Providing great benefits, competitive compensation, growth opportunities, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/&quot;&gt;other resources&lt;/a&gt; can help build a good employer reputation. HR can help practices stay in tune with employees and determine what benefits they care about the most. Creating this type of working environment not only attracts quality talent but also encourages employee loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create an Employee Handbook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An employee handbook is a valuable resource for employer and employee communication. While an employee handbook can help in a dispute, it is also an excellent way to define employee expectations and specify job descriptions clearly. Make sure to update the handbook as the practice grows or processes and procedures change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Payroll&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-check payment amounts before finalizing employee paychecks, especially when using an automated payroll program. Paying employees correctly and on time is one of the easiest ways to earn their trust, and failing to do so is one of the fastest ways to lose it. Setting and sticking to a payment schedule and remaining compliant with how employees are classified can be critical steps to avoiding payroll issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Taxation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practices should also be aware of which taxes they need to report and deposit. A few types of taxes to be aware of are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Federal income tax&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Federal unemployment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Medicare taxes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Social security &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers and employees share the responsibility for making sure to report taxes properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Management Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing employees can be one of the most challenging HR tasks. Proper processes for handling situations like employee termination and workers&amp;#8217; comp claims are essential. Having clear plans in place for these events will allow practices to manage them professionally and legally.&lt;/p&gt;

You can significantly improve the cash flow<a class="moretag" href="/techniques-for-having-a-zero-balance-office/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/techniques-for-having-a-zero-balance-office/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/techniques-for-having-a-zero-balance-office/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 20:00:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A zero balance office is one that does not have any accounts payable. You can significantly improve the cash flow of your practice and even reduce it to a zero balance. There are several ways to reduce the monthly accounts receivable balance without sacrificing the patient and practice relationship. Here are some simple practice management tips that you can use to impact your incoming revenue significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Establish Clear Patient Expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextLevel Practice believes the way a practice &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextlevelpractice.com/blog/what-is-your-money-mindset/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://nextlevelpractice.com/blog/what-is-your-money-mindset/&quot;&gt;handles cash flow&lt;/a&gt; can make or break it. Inform patients about payments and insurance before treatment. Doing this can result in receiving payment upfront or in a more timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Verify Insurance Before Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients often wrongly assume how much their insurance will cover their treatment. This assumption can cause practices to wait longer to receive a payment if the patient cannot make the difference upfront. Verify patient eligibility and coverage before treatment. Doing this informs the patient about how much they owe and allows them to prepare their payment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/&quot;&gt;List accepted insurance plans online&lt;/a&gt; so that patients can also verify that their current plan is compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Try to Collect Payment at the Time of Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although one should not expect every patient to pay off their balance in full, it is beneficial to try and ask every patient when they come to the office. Be prepared for patients that ask for options to spread their payment out. Walk them through the process of paying their balance and be specific about how to make payments. Process statements as quickly as possible as the longer it takes for patients to get a bill, the less likely the practice will receive payment at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take Advantage of Technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days of waiting a month for payment after mailing out a patient&amp;#8217;s statement. Patients can now make payments online in a matter of minutes. Online payment options can shorten wait times by about three weeks. Offering online bill pay is one of the easiest ways to achieve a zero balance office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ensure Appropriate Staffing Levels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems can arise when there are not enough employees to manage the number of patients. Details like checking patient invoices and promptly mailing out statements can be some of the first things to fall through the cracks. Check with team members and ensure that they have enough time and resources to deliver accurate and timely statements and process payments.&lt;/p&gt;

While you, as a health<a class="moretag" href="/how-to-set-kpis-for-a-medical-practice/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-set-kpis-for-a-medical-practice/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-set-kpis-for-a-medical-practice/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:00:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many service providers often measure the success of their businesses using profit and loss statements. While you, as a health care provider, may also place a huge emphasis on profits, your most telling indicator of success is the health and happiness of your patients. This may lead you, like many practitioners, to assume you do not need to set, measure, and analyze traditional key performance indicators. This could not be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An overview of KPIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, key performance indicators refer to set of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kpi.asp&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kpi.asp&quot;&gt;quantifiable markers&lt;/a&gt; that business leaders use to gauge the short- and long-term success of their efforts. Though KPIs are used to measure a number of operational and strategic achievements, you can use them to assess just about any area of your practice and even gauge its success compared to competitors’. The most common types of KPIs are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process: &lt;/strong&gt;Process KPIs focus on the efficiency, consistency, and/or quality of specific processes that were designed to achieve certain outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcomes: &lt;/strong&gt;These indicators relate to the impacts or accomplishments that certain processes achieve. Outcomes are typically classified in one of two ways: End outcomes, such as appointments or patient retention, and intermediate outcomes, such as increased practice awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input: &lt;/strong&gt;These KPIs measure the type, amount, and quality of resources a practice may use in the efforts to achieve a certain outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output: &lt;/strong&gt;Output measurements indicate how much work was completed and define what was produced.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project: &lt;/strong&gt;These KPIs involve the status of deliverables and the progress related to certain initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why KPIs matter for your medical practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the patient experience and level of care and increasing profit margins are just two of numerous reasons to establish key performance indicators for your practice. Among those include motivating team members by giving them measurable goals to work toward, identifying areas for improvement and ways your practice can be more competitive, evaluating employee performance, and identifying minor issues in your practice before they become bigger and costlier ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medical practice KPIs to keep a pulse on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong medical practice KPI is quantifiable, clearly defined, thoroughly communicated, and crucial to helping you achieve your overall objectives. While you may be able to come up with dozens of KPIs across various touchpoints of your practice, we have defined several across three key areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Operations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From patient wait time to staff to patient ratio to patient-doctor communication, there are several areas of operations to which you should pay attention to both increase patient retention and encourage patient referrals. The top five are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient Wait Time: &lt;/strong&gt;Keep track of the average amount of time patients wait to see a provider after checking in. Help staff with scheduling to reduce this average as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staff-to-Patient Ratio: &lt;/strong&gt;Pay attention to your team’s ability to deliver quality care given the number of patients to be seen at any given time and the resources on hand.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient Rooms in Use: &lt;/strong&gt;Think of this as your practice’s occupancy rate, and determine if you need more space to accommodate your growing practice.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Room Turnover Rate: &lt;/strong&gt;This plays a huge role in patient satisfaction, as it demonstrates how quickly patients move in and out of your facility.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication: &lt;/strong&gt;Assess whether more or less communication between your practice and patients is desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a health care provider, your number-one objective should be to deliver top-notch care to your patients. To determine if you routinely meet patients’ expectations or if you have your work cut out for you, refer to two main KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is medication errors. Keep track of the number of times you or a staff member makes a medication error. Medication errors can include anything from prescribing the wrong dose to writing a prescription for the wrong patient to using a pharmacy that routinely messes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second KPI is patient follow-up. Pay attention to the number of patients who receive follow-up care after their initial appointments. Follow-up care can be provided by you, a nurse, or a hygienist, and can be as simple as a receptionist reaching out to a patient to inquiry about how he or she is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finances&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, your main objective is to provide the best possible care to your patients, but the truth is that your practice is still a business. If you let the business side of it slide, you will not be able to fulfill your first goal. To determine how your practice is faring financially and to identify weak areas, there are a few KPIs to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost per visit is important. Every time a patient enters your office, it costs your practice money. If you spend more money to see patients than you make, it may be time to reevaluate your fee schedules, cost of supplies, cost of personnel, or all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-shows and canceled appointments cost you, but do you know how much? According to the data, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kareo.com/blog/article/best-practices-use-key-performance-indicators-manage-your-medical-billing-and-practice/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.kareo.com/blog/article/best-practices-use-key-performance-indicators-manage-your-medical-billing-and-practice/&quot;&gt;no-shows cost, on average, $150,000 per physician per year&lt;/a&gt;. Assess your no-show rate and devise ways to reduce it, such as sending out automated reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claim denials and delayed payments cost your practice money. If your denial rate is greater than 5%, it may be time to sit down with your billing department to figure out why denials are occurring and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/&quot;&gt;what you can do to prevent them in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are several other areas to which you can refer to assess your practice’s performance, but the above are a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

The amount of trust patients have in your practice, as well as what your practice is worth financially, can have a large impact on its health and growth. Taking a closer look at these can improve both your practice and the experience of your patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Different aspects of brand value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/stories/innovation/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-2020/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/stories/innovation/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-2020/&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; defines brand value by how much the brand would be worth if it was sold, there is much more that goes into determining that number than just inventory on hand or what is in the bank account. Revenue can sharply increase or decrease based on aspects such as brand authority and brand equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brand authority&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of trust patients have in your practice, as well as the degree to which patients view your practice as providing expert care in your specific field, determines its brand authority. Because this can be very subjective, brand authority can fluctuate quickly. Cure a high-profile patient or master a difficult medical procedure, and your practice will typically earn more brand authority. Cause complications for a well-known patient or get involved in a medical malpractice case and your brand authority will generally plummet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brand equity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loyalty of your patients, who your practice is associated with, and how visible your practice is combine to form brand equity. Like brand authority, brand equity can shift quickly because it is subjective. Become associated with a popular medial foundation or heal the mayor, and your practice is likely to get more visibility, thus increasing patient loyalty and, subsequently, brand equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The importance of brand value for patients &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A higher brand value can not only help increase the profitability of your practice, but also assist with improving patient relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Increased patient loyalty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the brand authority or brand value of your practice is low, patients tend to be warier about scheduling a procedure and can have negative expectations about their experience. In this case, it is easy for those expectations to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, even if nothing major goes wrong. When brand authority is high, patients are more likely to expect a positive experience at your practice. As long as these expectations are met, you have most likely created a patient for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Faster work in progress times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever looked at a stack of unpaid patient statements and wondered what you could do to encourage a faster work in progress time? Building brand authority and value can be part of the solution. Not many patients are rushing to pay the bill from a small, seemingly insignificant practice no one is talking about. However, patients can be more likely to submit payment more quickly for a well-respected practice that is popular in the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build your brand and your practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building your practice starts with patient acquisition, which our team at Doctor Genius knows all about. Our experience can help you understand and market your brand so that you can increase both brand awareness and your patient roster.

It requires planning and money to build a medical practice from the ground up. Getting the financing to start is a crucial element as, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/05/10/how-to-set-your-medical-practice-up-for-financial-success/?sh=4cbd0032b1d9&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/05/10/how-to-set-your-medical-practice-up-for-financial-success/?sh=4cbd0032b1d9&quot;&gt;Forbes.com&lt;/a&gt;, there are many factors to consider. There are various ways to secure the capital needed for starting a medical practice. At Doctor Genius, we want to see your practice become a reality. Find out the basic ins and outs of a medical practice loan to get things going in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The basics of a medical practice loan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a provider comes requesting financing, banks want to know about the practice. As a startup, there are no records or statements to supply. Thus, when seeking a loan, you must provide copies of your business plan, financial projections, and insight into how well similar practices perform in the area. Depending on your age and the state of your personal accounts, you may need a co-signer or someone with solid finances to back a traditional loan application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of loans for medical practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a medical practitioner, you may find there are more types of loans available for you than the lending options for traditional businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Equipment leasing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening a medical practice often requires expensive and advanced equipment. Purchasing these items outright may not make much sense because the technology is always evolving and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/&quot;&gt;newer models are introduced frequently&lt;/a&gt;. You may want to instead take a look at leasing the equipment you need. Finance companies and equipment retailers may have contracts that allow medical practices to rent any piece of equipment needed. At the end of the lease term, you may choose to purchase the items or lease new models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Line of credit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when the practice may need access to cash quickly. A business line of credit may prove the best option. This financing option allows you open access to a set amount of funds. You use what you need when you need it. Otherwise, the available balance remains accessible only when it is needed. This type of loan can provide peace of mind for emergency situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Short-term business loan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short-term business loan is one of the easiest ways you can get cash for your practice. Many lenders have online portals and can provide approval in a short time. These loans are typically best for situational purchases. The information required to get this type of loan is minimal and the money usually is provided quickly. The repayment terms can range from three months to three years, with payments typically auto-debited from your business account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let us help calculate costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not let the worry about securing a medical practice loan overcome the prospect of starting your own business. With so many financing options available, you can surely find something that fits your needs. Keep in mind that there are other requirements for creating a successful business and financial forecast. Marketing and digital development is something that our team at DG can help you pin down.

If you are looking to increase<a class="moretag" href="/why-google-reviews-can-be-more-authentic-than-yelp/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-google-reviews-can-be-more-authentic-than-yelp/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-google-reviews-can-be-more-authentic-than-yelp/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 20:00:19 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The number of reviews on Google far surpasses those on other local review sites. If you are looking to increase your practice&amp;#8217;s online reviews to appeal to more patients, it is better to focus on Google reviews over Yelp reviews. Here are some reasons to concentrate your efforts on Google reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Better Way To Promote a Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571&quot;&gt;BrightLocal&lt;/a&gt;, Google reviews can be the way to go when looking to improve SEO ranking. Using the right review platform can make marketing efforts as productive as possible. Reports from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/&quot;&gt;ReviewTrackers&lt;/a&gt; show 63.6% of people check Google reviews before choosing a business to visit. Putting more time into increasing reviews on other platforms may not receive a favorable investment return. As the average star rating on Google is notably higher than on Yelp, a business is more likely to benefit from a higher rating on Google than Yelp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoid the Negative Impact of Yelp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ReviewTrackers report also notes that most people use filters when searching to eliminate any business with less than a four-star rating. Yelp may exclude one&amp;#8217;s practice from search results before even being viewed since it has a lower average rating. In this case, the practice will be affected by a lack of visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encourage Patients To Leave Google Reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not all reviewers will use Google, it can be beneficial to encourage patients to review one&amp;#8217;s practice on the desired platform. Rather than use vague language when asking for a review, mention Google specifically. Most people tend to follow directions, and because Google is a widely popular platform as well as user-friendly, it should be simple for patients to leave a review on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add a Direct Link&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tip is to add a website link that leads directly to the Google review form. This addition will make it easier for patients to leave reviews on that site instead of having to pull one up by themselves. Many practices send patients an email after treatment or procedures to ensure they are recovering well and are not experiencing any unexpected side effects. Asking specifically for a Google review and adding a direct link in this type of email can remind patients who may have forgotten to leave a Google review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Draw Patients in With Positive Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team at Doctor Genius knows how important it is to get good online reviews. Reviews can have a tremendous impact on your practice. We are here to help you with your online presence and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/differentiating-your-site-in-a-service-model-with-unlimited-competitors/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/differentiating-your-site-in-a-service-model-with-unlimited-competitors/&quot;&gt;digital marketing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; and see how our marketing solutions can help your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

According to Solution Reach, patient attrition rates<a class="moretag" href="/how-to-retain-patients/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-retain-patients/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-retain-patients/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 20:00:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patient retention is a more significant problem than patient acquisition for many medical practitioners. According to Solution Reach, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solutionreach.com/infographics/6-ways-to-retain-your-patients&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.solutionreach.com/infographics/6-ways-to-retain-your-patients&quot;&gt;patient attrition rates hover between 10% and 30%,&lt;/a&gt; on average. However, research shows that making patient retention an integral part of practice management can reduce attrition rates by as much as 70%. If patient retention is not among your practice&amp;#8217;s top priorities, it should be. Read why patient retention is so important and learn some strategies that you can use to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Focusing on Patient Satisfaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, 70% of patients leave a practice because of the practice&amp;#8217;s indifference. That means that only 30% of patients leave because of uncontrollable factors like job loss, income reduction, relocation, and other major life events. This information shows that one of the best ways to raise retention rates is to create a better patient experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping patients happy by making them feel valued can improve retention. Some ways to do this are treating patients as partners in their healthcare journey and using compassionate bedside manners when interacting with them. Keeping patients informed and following up with them after an appointment can also result in better patient experiences and retention rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lowering Wait Times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient satisfaction is also affected by the wait time. Medical practitioners with wait times around 60 minutes received an average satisfaction score of 53 from patients. However, those whose wait times no longer than 10 minutes had average satisfaction scores of 77. For every 10 minutes of additional wait time, scores dropped between six and 10 points. Try to keep the office running as smoothly and efficiently as possible to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making Healthcare Convenient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Younger generations value convenience across all aspects of their lives, including healthcare. Convenience is among their top five priorities. Here are some elements of convenient healthcare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Ability to get test results without seeing a doctor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Ability to view health information in one place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Convenient location and hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Convenient scheduling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Easy check-in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Online bill pay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Online registration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Wait time visibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offices that are not doing any of the above may want to update their processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asking for Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practice can not know how its patients feel unless they ask. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-location-for-feedback-can-solve-management-problems/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-location-for-feedback-can-solve-management-problems/&quot;&gt;Incorporate ways to solicit feedback&lt;/a&gt; from patients, both in-office and online. This feedback is valuable for learning and bettering the patient experience.&lt;/p&gt;

This strategic<a class="moretag" href="/sources-of-positive-pr-for-small-practices/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/sources-of-positive-pr-for-small-practices/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/sources-of-positive-pr-for-small-practices/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2020 20:00:39 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Engaging in public relations is an excellent way for local organizations to grow and promote their small practice. This strategic communications process helps businesses build a positive public image and develop beneficial relationships with the public. Public relations is not just for large businesses but is beneficial for smaller, local practices as well. It is possible to build your practice&amp;#8217;s image without an expensive public relations agency. Here are some public relations activities that you can implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earning Attention and Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialized knowledge or experience can give a practice a leg up on the competition. Share timely and relevant stories across channels to earn people&amp;#8217;s trust and attention. An example of this is developing a list of professional tips to help prospective patients or other medical professionals in the community and publishing it in a local paper, magazine, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6671-public-relations-solutions.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6671-public-relations-solutions.html&quot;&gt;popular online source&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowing the Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In small communities, events like sporting games, fairs or festivals, and fundraisers are excellent ways to get one&amp;#8217;s name out in public. Practices can sponsor a sports team or concert, operate a booth at an event, or volunteer with a nonprofit charity. These activities will help with name recognition and also boost reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Putting Together a Media Kit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A media kit is a collection of information about a business for the press. This kit provides reporters and editors with the information they need to write about the business. Media kits should be up to date and available at all times, as it is possible to make a connection with someone willing to promote one&amp;#8217;s practice at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships are essential to public relations, whether with reporters, media outlets, or social media influencers. Identify those who have influence and build those relationships. People and outlets like this have already earned their followers&amp;#8217; trust, so the people and products they recommend are likely to be taken seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Being Patient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small practices can be impatient when it comes to producing results from public relations activities. It is important to remain patient as it can take three to six months to reap the benefits. Reputation development is a long-term investment that will build recognition and create trust over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building a Positive Reputation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small practices have very different marketing and public relations needs than large ones. Doctor Genius has innovative and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-marketing-spending-can-help-you-beat-competitors/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-marketing-spending-can-help-you-beat-competitors/&quot;&gt;effective marketing solutions&lt;/a&gt; to serve your practice needs. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Call us&lt;/a&gt; to speak with a member of our trained staff and learn how our marketing plans can boost your online reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

This tactic is particularly helpful for<a class="moretag" href="/what-is-organic-marketing-growth/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-organic-marketing-growth/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-organic-marketing-growth/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 20:00:50 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic marketing is one of the most effective growth marketing strategies for small practices. This tactic is particularly helpful for smaller practices because it is less expensive. This kind of marketing takes place naturally over time and can help draw in new patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generating Website Growth Organically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/blog/paid-organic-marketing-strategy-blog/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/blog/paid-organic-marketing-strategy-blog/&quot;&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;, organic marketing is an excellent way to increase website traffic and landing page viewership. Instead of paying for ads or sponsored posts, traffic is generated naturally over time through organic marketing. Check out these examples of organic marketing and how it is beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blog Posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogs are a great way to reach a large audience online, whether it is one&amp;#8217;s content or someone else&amp;#8217;s. Linking back to blogs on social media is a great way to increase organic traffic to a practice&amp;#8217;s website. Being featured in a blog post can also help gain recognition among members of the local community. Reaching out to writers and asking them to include a website link in a blog can also encourage web traffic. Each time a practice is mentioned in a blog or on another web page, it can help improve its search engine ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Media Posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is another aspect of organic marketing. When patients post about a practice or&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/&quot;&gt; share its content&lt;/a&gt; on social media, it is an opportunity for their followers to not only read the post but repost it themselves. The number of people reading about the practice can thus grow exponentially. One can also use social media marketing to boost organic reach by sharing their website&amp;#8217;s content on social media. With the wide variety of social media platforms available, organic marketing is significant and takes place constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another organic marketing activity is creating case studies. These case studies can be about different topics like interesting cases to specialty treatments. This information provides helpful information for other patients dealing with similar concerns and can attract patients who were unaware of those treatments. Having a case study published can be a great way to promote services and gain credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email Blasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emails sent to existing or prospective patients are also organic marketing. These emails can be about a new service offering or a more advanced treatment method. Updating previous patients with these emails can be an effective way to help them remember one&amp;#8217;s practice and possibly spread the information organically to the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feel Confident About Your Marketing Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic marketing is one possible element of an effective marketing strategy. At Doctor Genius, we have innovative marketing solutions to help your practice reach more clients.

While being professional, a dental office should also encourage a comfortable and relaxing environment for patients. The right design can transform your office and help calm your patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alleviating Patient Anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statisticstats.com/health/dentophobia-statistics-of-dentist-fear-and-anxiety/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.statisticstats.com/health/dentophobia-statistics-of-dentist-fear-and-anxiety/&quot;&gt;75% of adults experience fear or anxiety about visiting the dentist&lt;/a&gt;. Of those adults, between 5% to 10% have a dental phobia, which is more severe than generalized fear. While the fear of pain is the number one reason for fearing the dentist, a dental office environment can heighten those feelings. Having the right office decor can alleviate tension and anxiety in patients and drastically improve their overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using Decor to Create a Comfortable Atmosphere&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before decorating an office, think about the way patients feel. Creating a homey atmosphere with decor can calm patients and help them feel at ease. In the past dental offices were characterized by rows of plastic chairs, coffee tables stacked with magazines, and possibly a toy or two for children. Today, this noticeably low-effort decor can send the message of not caring about one&amp;#8217;s patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating elements that one would find in a home can help give patients more positive feelings. Items like a well-stocked mini-fridge, a coffee maker, and comfortable furniture create a more inviting and cheerful atmosphere. As for the artwork, use more unique pieces to make a greater impact. Photos, paintings, and drawings are a great way to inject warmth and personality into the office. Choose pieces that complement the rest of the decor rather than clash with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding a Touch of Nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental offices can easily feel cold, impersonal, and sterile. Adding plants throughout the office can help combat those feelings without buying new furniture or artwork. Flowers and other decorative plants help breathe life into an office and allow patients to feel more at ease. Certain plants like lavender, chrysanthemum, and aloe vera may also have a calming effect on patients. The sight of thriving foliage in a waiting room can make a statement about the level of caring and attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Playing Background Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soothing power of background music is invaluable to dental offices. Studies have shown that slower tempo tunes are great for relaxation and stress management. According to researchers at Stanford University, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/may31/brainwave-053106.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/may31/brainwave-053106.html&quot;&gt;listening to music has the same effect on brain functioning as anxiety-reducing medications&lt;/a&gt;. Offices can play commercial-free, lyric-free background music to help put patients at ease and keep them calm for the duration of their appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain types of music are better for stress reduction than others. Celtic, Native American and Indian-stringed instruments are among the top sounds that people respond to favorably. Classical music, light jazz, or other types of easy-listening music are popular choices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Color Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although amenities, artwork, and background music are important, color is another significant factor in creating a calm environment for patients. Color is a powerful communication tool that can impact a person’s emotions and physiological reactions. Certain colors are associated with increased metabolism and high blood pressure, while others are associated with calmness and stress release. Using the right colors can help inspire feelings of ease in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using the Colors Green, Blue, and Purple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the symbolic color of nature, green can evoke calmness and tranquility in patients, making it an ideal color to use as the basis for an office. Some ways to incorporate this color is by painting the walls of patient rooms in a soothing hue of green or adding other green decorations throughout the office. Blue is a popular color in the business world, as research shows that this color can incite feelings of trustworthiness and calmness. Using blue can help patients feel more trusting, which is important for patient retention and helping them feel comfortable. The use of purple can also add a feminine touch to a dental office. Purple combines the calming effects of blue with the energy of red, making it a great accent color for certain types of dental practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keeping Age in Mind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to think about the age group that one&amp;#8217;s practice caters to when decorating an office. Offices that treat adults can use their decor to create an environment where patients can relax. One can also make an office more entertaining for adults by installing televisions to distract patients while waiting or getting a procedure done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental offices that cater to children can incorporate elements to foster a fun and cheerful environment. When designing a dental waiting area for children, one can use bright colors and soft materials with fun toys and games to help keep them entertained and calm while waiting. When serving children, consider adding the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Dedicated play area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Fun murals and wallpapers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Healthy snacks and beverages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Kid-friendly literature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Kid-sized furniture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Modern Patient Experience Begins Online&lt;/h2&gt;

However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to<a class="moretag" href="/what-is-barnacle-seo/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-barnacle-seo/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-barnacle-seo/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:00:07 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using the right keywords is important for your business. However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to rank on their own with so much competition. Barnacle SEO is an effective technique in these situations to help such businesses rank for competitive keywords. Here is why this technique is effective and why our team at Doctor Genius prefers to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Overview of Barnacle SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Search Influence&amp;#8217;s Will Scott coined the term &amp;#8220;barnacle SEO&amp;#8221; to describe the process of smaller businesses attaching their names to larger, more established domains to benefit from their authority. Using established websites that rank for the most popular and competitive keywords can help a small or new business rank higher without doing the same work necessary for traditional SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnacle SEO mimics the relationship that takes place in the natural world between barnacles and whales. Barnacles, tiny arthropods no bigger than an inch in diameter, attach themselves to a moving object, like a whale, to gather nutrients from the current. Similar to this relationship, a business can benefit from attaching its name to a search engine whale. The business can go wherever the search engine whale goes, even to the top of the SERPs. The barnacle and whale relationship is a commensal one. The barnacle does not hurt the whale, nor does it help it. However, in order to make the most of the barnacle SEO technique, it is important to act more like a partner to the big websites and less like a parasite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Guest Blogging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest blogging is one of the most popular barnacle SEO activities. This particular strategy involves reaching out to websites and pitching a guest blog post. Doing this can seem intimidating for small and new businesses. However, blogs with authority may be willing to work with smaller ones, especially if helping out means adding another article to be ranked on their website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Before reaching out to a website, it is beneficial to research topics that are trending in a particular niche. It is also helpful to consider topics that have not had much coverage but may benefit readers. Identify top blogs and craft an attractive pitch for a guest blog post. If the website is big enough, a guest blog can receive many visitors and shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Types of Websites to Target&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using barnacle SEO does not always involve asking for a guest blog appearance. Another activity involves targeting websites that people use daily. These websites are online directories and publishing platforms. Some commonly used websites for barnacle SEO are Google My Business, Angie&amp;#8217;s List, Facebook, and TripAdvisor. It is also beneficial to identify websites that specifically cater to one&amp;#8217;s niche. Once the target sites are identified, one can create a profile to list their business and begin using barnacle SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Leverage Review Sites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several benefits to leveraging review sites. One significant advantage is that it can help with SEO. Review sites like TripAdvisor, Google My Business, Yelp, Angie&amp;#8217;s List, and Foursquare have a lot of search engine authority. Make sure to keep all information up-to-date on each review site. It is also essential to complete a profile and include all the information that potential customers will need, like the business location, hours, and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong profile with positive customer reviews can help to rank higher for local searches. In addition to boosting online reputation, it is also a great way to get more direct and organic traffic. When creating a profile, it is also necessary to consider the types of terms that typically rank well for review sites. Some examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;(Product or service) review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;(Product or service) alternatives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Tools like (product or service)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing for Publishing Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listing a business on online directories is a popular barnacle SEO strategy, but other options can also yield good results. Writing for any of the many publishing platforms can help expand reach. One of the most popular and effective publishing platforms is Medium. Medium consistently ranks on the first page for competitive key terms in various industries, from business to health. Another benefit of Medium is that its results often include featured snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post&quot;&gt;Publishing on Medium&lt;/a&gt; is fairly straightforward. It is acceptable to target an industry&amp;#8217;s most competitive key terms when using barnacle SEO. Here is an overview of the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Conduct keyword research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Select the search intent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Optimize content so it aligns with the target keyword&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Use subheadings and incorporate keywords where possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Embed or add creatives, such as images, infographics, and video&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, make sure the writing is of high quality. Medium has domain authority, so write like an authority figure. The content should be easy to read and understand but also informative and factual.

Reaching your audience,<a class="moretag" href="/how-to-connect-to-an-audience-through-social-media/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-connect-to-an-audience-through-social-media/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-connect-to-an-audience-through-social-media/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 20:00:43 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to effectively manage your practice&amp;#8217;s social media accounts while taking care of patients. Reaching your audience, building relationships, and creating a good first impression online requires more than just posting an advertisement. Interactive marketing relies on communication and relevancy to make an impact. Here are some tips to boost your online presence and connect with your audience through social media organically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variety and Frequency of Social Media Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the social media platforms used, there is a sweet spot for how many times to post. However, there is no hard and fast rule for how often a business should post. It is also essential to create engaging and informative content to get the audience interested in learning more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tailor Each Platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be appropriate to post on some platforms daily, while others may only require posting a few days a week. Sticking to approximately one post per day is ideal for most social media platforms. This practice is especially true for Facebook and Instagram, where posting one to two times a day is acceptable for most businesses. Posting less than this may cause prospective patients to lose interest, while posting more can overwhelm or even annoy leads. Consistency is key for both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Twitter, there is much more flexibility in how frequently to post, as there is often a shorter window for businesses to reach clients just after tweeting. Some businesses can post as many as five times a day with good results. Posting once a day during the workweek on LinkedIn is ideal as business professionals, and older adults primarily use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Forms of Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a limit on how often to post on social media accounts, there is no limit to online engagement with prospective and current clients. If someone interacts with a platform through a comment or question, the business should &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/&quot;&gt;try to respond immediately&lt;/a&gt;. The sooner the response, the better the chances are of meeting their needs and establishing a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to keep track of social media communication, so turning on notifications for accounts or assigning an individual to manage the social media page can help one remain consistent. If responding right away is not possible, try to answer at least by the end of the day. Social media interaction with clients is now more important than ever. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that 33% of customers prefer to contact companies through social media rather than the phone and that 77% of U.S. online adults say that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide good service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Developing a Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to delivering great content is to design a social media strategy. This plan should identify marketing goals and the target audience. There are many different approaches to social media marketing that a business may take. Still, there are common goals like building brand awareness, growing page likes, generating leads, and increasing website visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Developing Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first marketing campaign for recently established businesses or ones new to social media should build the target audience&amp;#8217;s awareness. Businesses will often use paid advertisements geared toward a specific demographic to do this. Having a solid understanding of the brand identity and niche can help make this process quicker and more successful. Growing page likes is important as audience engagement is essential to making the most of investments in social media marketing. Encouraging page likes is one way to grow an audience. One way to do this is through doing page-like campaigns to get people to follow a practice on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary business goal is to generate sales. In the medical field, this means finding potential patients seeking services and getting them to contact one&amp;#8217;s office. Lead generation is more successful after a business gains a decent level of brand awareness. People are more likely to hear about a practice through social media than to land organically on a page through a search engine. One way to do this is by starting a social media campaign geared towards link clicks. This campaign can increase a website&amp;#8217;s SEO and get more people to visit the website and learn more about the services available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Diversifying Types of Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a social media strategy is in place, the next step is to create content. Creating content that informs and interests people can draw in potential patients. Posts should vary depending on the platforms used instead of relying on the same type of content. Diversifying content through various images, videos, polls, contests, and more can lead to more audience engagement and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add hashtags to posts and engage the audience by asking questions, sharing pictures of patients (with permission) on social media, and showing engagement in the local community. One can also use the story features on social media to get followers interested in what they do. While a social media marketing strategy can also include advertisements, including content that feels organic helps visitors relate and feel more connected while interacting online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reach More Patients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing your social media presence and connecting with your audience through interactive marketing can help you reach more people. At Doctor Genius, we have developed multiple ways to help you do this. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Give us a call&lt;/a&gt;, and learn how our marketing solutions can get you more clients.&lt;/p&gt;

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future<a class="moretag" href="/post-covid-dental-landscape-competitive-advantages-with-digital-marketing/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/post-covid-dental-landscape-competitive-advantages-with-digital-marketing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/post-covid-dental-landscape-competitive-advantages-with-digital-marketing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 22:00:12 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;COVID-19 has altered the dental landscape as we know it. The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; webinar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Post-COVID Digital Marketing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Search Engine Optimization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Social Media and Online Engagement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Content Marketing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana, Alexa, and Google Home have become increasingly prevalent and staple in many people’s lives. It is not uncommon for people to have several virtual assistants integrated with their smart devices like home systems, mobile devices, cars, smartwatches, and even television remotes. Here are some tips and insights to help your practice be one of the first options when someone uses a voice search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the Right Keyword Phrases for Virtual Assistants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keywords are the foundation of all SEO. Various factors determine a webpage’s ranking. However, performing keyword research and implementing these phrases into a website’s content is much more likely to get higher on the SERP. It is important to note that the keywords that are successful in online search engines are not always the same for voice search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Considering Natural Speech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways one can increase their practice’s ranking for voice search is by understanding the difference between the way people speak and the way people write. People are much more likely to use fragmented phrases when searching for content on a mobile device or computer. In this case, short-tail keywords can be more successful. On the other hand, people often speak in complete sentences, even when talking to a virtual assistant, as speaking out loud is easier and quicker than typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content should include long-tail keyword phrases formatted like a question to improve the voice search SEO. Instead of optimizing for a short phrase like “root canal treatment,” include a long-tail keyword like, “Where can I get a root canal treated?” People will often include more context when using voice search, which pulls up different results than a more general search inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAQ Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective method to incorporate more questions into a website’s written content is by including FAQs. Having a designated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/best-faq-page-examples/267709/#close&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/best-faq-page-examples/267709/#close&quot;&gt;FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; is one way to do this. One can also structure blog posts and other page content into a question and answer format by turning primary headers into questions. For instance, instead of using the header, “Types of Clear Aligners,” a website can use “What Are the Different Types of Clear Aligners?” The following section would then aim to answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prioritizing Local SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While local SEO is essential regardless of the search method used, voice search is more likely to be tailored to the location. Virtual assistants and mobile devices are often linked, so information about the user like search history, preferences, and location is known. People often use Siri or other AI technologies to search for activities, restaurants, and stores nearby. It is important to focus on the local audience, as few people will travel far outside the city they reside or work in to seek care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using location-specific keywords can increase the chances someone will see one practice before another. People also often ask a general query like, “Where is a chiropractor near me?” In this case, it would be beneficial to use a keyword phrase like, “Where is a dentist in Spokane?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google My Business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/business/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.google.com/business/&quot;&gt;Google My Business&lt;/a&gt; listing and making sure that it is up to date can help local keyword phrases lead people to a business. This listing should have relevant info like the address, phone number, category, and business hours. Google My Business also gives patients a platform to leave reviews, photos, and questions. The account&amp;#8217;s success can have a significant impact on SEO ranking for virtual assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ranking for Different Virtual Assistants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each virtual assistant has its own set of criteria to consider for ranking. Not all virtual assistants use the same search engine to pull results when someone uses voice search, so they may need to consider optimizing content for more than one. Most businesses primarily focus on Google, the primary search engine for Google Home, Android devices, and Siri. However, Bing is the default search engine for both Alexa and Cortana. Although users can ask most virtual assistants to use a different search engine, many do not. Taking the time to understand and optimize content for multiple search engines can help a website better reach more users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to rank any products that one&amp;#8217;s practice might sell on Alexa. As Alexa is an Amazon product, it prioritizes Amazon Choice items or suggests items similar to the searcher’s previous purchases. If the search query does not have an Amazon Choice item, Alexa will provide the top search result that is Prime eligible. There is no way to apply for being an Amazon Choice product. Prime eligible products have a high rating, are bought often, have a low return rate, and are in stock and ready to ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many factors to consider for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/just-magic-seo-services-doctor-genius&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/just-magic-seo-services-doctor-genius&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt;, it can be challenging for your practice to reach its entire audience.

Your practice must stand out on the<a class="moretag" href="/seo-value-of-listing-your-organization-affiliation/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-value-of-listing-your-organization-affiliation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-value-of-listing-your-organization-affiliation/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 20:00:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attracting clients and retaining them is an essential part of any successful practice. Your practice must stand out on the internet to do well in a competitive industry. Establishing trust with your audience is a great way to stand out from the competition. One way to build this trust is by including your affiliation with an organization. This information provides trust signals that can contribute to more page views and clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Benefits of Listing Professional Affiliations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to list the professional organizations a company is affiliated with when creating a webpage for a practice. Listing this information can improve conversion numbers by showcasing professionalism and providing examples of personal endeavors. Doing this will help establish audience trust and help boost website search results. It is easy to create content that speaks to one&amp;#8217;s affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Website SEO Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website is the first impression many potential clients have of a practice. It should provide responsible and engaging content that relates relevant information to the audience without being overwhelming. While it is effective to list professional affiliations in the &amp;#8220;About Us&amp;#8221; section of the website, it is also beneficial to incorporate them in &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly/&quot;&gt;regular blog posts&lt;/a&gt; to boost SEO-driven hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Approval and Endorsement From a Professional Organization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people start searches with a query about fixing a problem. Creating blogs about the services a practice offers to solve those problems can help with ranking. One can easily integrate an organizational affiliation into those blogs by highlighting any organization-approved methods or products used in treatments or services. Creating blog posts about industry news and the organizations relevant to it can also help raise one&amp;#8217;s profile. The website can also include any practice-specific news. For example, if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaoinfo.org/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.aaoinfo.org/&quot;&gt;American Association of Orthodontists&lt;/a&gt; endorses the office, highlighting this membership can increase reliability rating with readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Affiliation With Charitable Organizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice should also list any affiliations with charitable organizations. Information about volunteering with organizations like Operation Smile or Easterseals can also help practice ranking. Showing how practice members lent their time and skills is another way organizational affiliation can build audience trust. Blog posts about practice involvement in charitable organizations are another excellent way to get more website hits and include affiliate links to the relevant sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Know SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listing an affiliation with a professional organization is important for SEO. Including this information on a website can help you build credibility and rank higher in the search results. Our team at Doctor Genius can provide you with digital marketing solutions to reach your goals. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Give us a call&lt;/a&gt; and learn about how our search engine optimization strategies can benefit your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

It differs from traditional SEO in that you do not optimize your website for these key terms but rather optimize the authoritative site for them. Here is why you would want to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Concept Behind Barnacle SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnacle SEO is a term to describe a relationship similar to one that occurs in the natural world. In nature, barnacles will attach themselves to a moving object, such as a whale, so that they may drift along with the whale through the current and catch whatever nutrients come by. In turn, the barnacles provide the whale with something akin to a suit of armor. This concept works the same regarding big and small websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using Other Sites To Improving Ranking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its own, a small website has little to no chance of ranking for the industry’s most competitive key terms. It would be a significant drain on one&amp;#8217;s resources to try to. Fortunately, sites are available that easily rank for those keywords that one can attach their brand’s name to benefit from their authority. Two of the biggest “whales,” so to speak, are Google and Yelp. However, there are other useful sites to which a brand can attach their name to. Some of these sites can serve a practice better than Google or Yelp. For instance, health practitioners may also want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/using-doctor-ratings-sites#1&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/using-doctor-ratings-sites#1&quot;&gt;look into niche sites&lt;/a&gt; like Vitals and Healthgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Google Business Profile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google Business Profile is vital for SEO since it helps gain search engine visibility and gives businesses a better chance of appearing in local Google Search results and Google Maps. A Google My Business account allows one to claim ownership of their Business Profile and make changes to it. Making changes and updating information to ensure it is accurate creates an optimized profile that helps it rank for local and competitive keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Yelp Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the largest local review site next to Google+ Local, Yelp matters a lot. Yelp pages often show up at the top of Google for even generic terms like doctor, dentist, and chiropractor. Yelp results also feature ratings, which heavily influence conversions. The site also influences Google and Bing behind the scenes, meaning that a strong Yelp profile with many reviews can cause either of the search engines to show a profile before others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supporting Your Barnacle SEO Efforts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Yelp&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/&quot;&gt; can support your barnacle SEO efforts&lt;/a&gt; in unique ways.

There is a good chance that your targeted audience may first interact with your brand on a social media platform before ever encountering your website. Having a strong strategy will allow you to build brand awareness, create good organic posts, and convert qualified leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up Your Social Media Accounts for Success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is a great time to get started if your business does not have any social media accounts yet. Take time to evaluate which platforms may be the most beneficial for your company, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understand the Different Social Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a general understanding of the various social platforms, the type of content, and the audience they attract can help you set up your accounts effectively. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/&quot;&gt;Instagram statistics&lt;/a&gt; show the site is most popular among younger adults aged 18 to 34. On the other hand. LinkedIn&amp;#8217;s primary users are between the ages of 46 and 55 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a Brand Identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your office branding should be consistent everywhere people may interact with it. If your company has designed a logo, this image should appear on your signs, marketing collateral, company website, and social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identify Your Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the numbers to evaluate where your company currently is at versus where you need it to be. If your office is already active on social media, identify which areas you need to improve on and focus on those.  Investing in building brand awareness is important to do before directing your efforts towards lead generation and conversions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Balance Paid and Organic Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using social media, businesses have two main tools to reach people and direct them towards a specific action: paid advertisements and organic content. Your office does not have to have a large following to reach your intended audience, as most sites do not post your ads on your account. Using paid ads can help you get page likes and present your brand to people who fit your target demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic content includes posts on your page. Keep up on posting and engage with your audience to establish your brand and draw potential patients to your office. When done correctly, this can help boost your website’s SEO ranking by encouraging backlinking to highly shared content and increasing the number of branded searches on search engines from people who interact with your office on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build Brand Awareness and Boost SEO With Social Media&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital world, social media is a necessary aspect of a business. Our team at Doctor Genius can help you build your social media presence as you sit back and watch it grow. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; today to learn more about our packages and discover how working with the right digital marketing company can help you reach your business goals.&lt;/p&gt;

This type of employee wants to be highly thought of and produce quality work. Intrinsic motivators can be some of the most compelling reasons why individuals choose to work in the medical field. Let&amp;#8217;s examine ways to take advantage of intrinsic motivation in a medical office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Get rid of preconceived ideas about motivation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;editor-rtfLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tutor2u.net/business/reference/motivation-pink-three-elements-of-intrinsic-motivation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Daniel Pink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;, a well-known author and speaker about motivation, the common tendency is to think of motivation as either based on fear or excitement. Many people are motivated by the fear of failure, disappointing others, or punishment. As well, just about everyone appears to work harder when excited by the promise of a reward, either in the form of a compliment or a bonus. While these things may be true, though, they are not necessarily the primary reasons for people&amp;#8217;s actions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Discover what truly motivates your staff members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;When office management is aware of the primary reasons employees are motivated, managers can both help staff members to thrive and encourage them to be more productive. This in turn can enhance the patient experience. Here are three main intrinsic motivators to consider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;The ability to self-manage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;This can be a struggle for many management teams, because the traditional office system requires employees to comply with orders and dutifully complete tasks without question. However, allowing staff members to self-direct can be an excellent way to get them more engaged in their work. It can also open the door for them to present thoughts or ideas related to the job and the improvement of related processes or programs. It is critical to find a balance between assigning tasks and allowing employees to suggest them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;The desire for self-improvement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Progress and personal achievement can be incredible motivators. When people improve because they want to rather than because they are told to, the results come much faster and last much longer. The trick with implementing this type of motivator is to assign tasks that are not too difficult but go beyond the basics of what is commonly performed by the employee. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;The desire to connect with a bigger cause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Most people want to do things that make a difference or leave a lasting impression. Menial tasks tend to be a disincentive or deterrence to job satisfaction. Because the bulk of an employee&amp;#8217;s daytime hours are typically spent at work, it can be much more motivating when that work matters in a meaningful way. A key way to introduce this in a medical office is to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;editor-rtfLink&quot; href=&quot;https://smallbusiness.chron.com/communicate-new-mission-vision-30929.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;clearly communicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt; the goals, values, and mission of the company. Understanding how their role within the office matters can allow employees to feel they are contributing to the greater good. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Motivate your office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Tapping into the intrinsic motivators of your medical office staff can help employees get more enjoyment out of their jobs, increase productivity, and even improve the patient experience. At Doctor Genius, we understand how critical it is to care for both patients and staff members.

Because the demand to lower the cost of health care is becoming more urgent, it can be helpful to streamline the process of eliminating unnecessary expenses by understanding and implementing this type of accounting system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is cost accounting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cost accounting system focuses on recording, classifying, and allocating the expenses of a company to help determine the actual cost of services and products. The idea is when the exact uses of funds are known, costs of services and products can not only be clearly defined but also reduced. This accounting method can also help pinpoint the profitability of specific ventures or expenditures so more well-informed decisions can be made about future purchases or endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/healthcare-cost-accounting-8-strategies-to-streamline-implementation-and-quickly-achieve-measurable-results.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/healthcare-cost-accounting-8-strategies-to-streamline-implementation-and-quickly-achieve-measurable-results.html&quot;&gt;Becker&amp;#8217;s Hospital CFO Report&lt;/a&gt;, the main obstacle to overcome when trying to implement a cost accounting system is creating an accurate Relative Value Unit without being overwhelmed or confused by the math. Because the RVU ultimately helps to determine the costs associated with the charge description master, which can be extensive and complex, it is important to establish clear, correct RVUs before proceeding further. It is also crucial to have the cooperation of everyone involved with the practice since efficient communication of data can be a large part of the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5 ways to make cost accounting work for a medical practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are differences between how a traditional company and a medical practice operate, but an accounting method like this can work particularly well in a service industry where costs are tied more to time and expertise than products. Here are some tips to help your medical practice implement an effective cost accounting system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Delegate to responsible team members&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than having one person attempt to figure out all the RVUs alone, it can be helpful to get other staff members involved. Especially for larger practices with multiple departments, tasking a tenured, capable staff member from each department with compiling specific RVUs can speed the process up quite a bit. Even for smaller practices, enlisting the assistance of staff members who are familiar with the services and products can help establish these amounts more accurately. When deciding who to select for the assignment, take into consideration factors such as how well the employee knows the CDM codes, resource consumption, and operating procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Ensure the correct CDM codes are being used&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from their importance for cost accounting, correct CDM usage is beneficial for patients and medical practices alike to ensure proper billing and insurance charges. Because CDM codes play a significant role in defining the RVUs, CDMs used incorrectly can result in inaccurate numbers. Charges are also becoming increasingly automated, and some software does not require individual service codes to be entered manually. Before relying on CDM codes to help generate RVUs, it can be important to revisit how the codes are being applied to get the most accurate RVUs possible. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hfma.org/topics/article/57212.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.hfma.org/topics/article/57212.html&quot;&gt;Healthcare Financial Management Association&lt;/a&gt;, respondents to a survey reported the area that most needed improvement was statistics and RVUs. This shows team members are aware of a deficiency and may welcome additional training in this area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Utilize all available techniques and data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not necessary to develop all the RVUs from scratch. For some services and products, there will be information such as actual cost, industry-standard RVUs, and staffing ratios that allow the RVU to be determined quickly. In many cases, the actual cost of products is known or can be determined easily by contacting the vendor rep. Some factors, such as time spent on a service or clinical skill level required, are also fairly objective and can be used to develop a standardized RVU. In many cases, a minimum cost for these factors already exists, and all that is left to do is determining how much the margin needs to increase to meet the fiscal needs of the practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Prioritize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should naturally be a large difference in dollar amount between your most costly and least costly RVUs. Instead of determining them by department, alphabetically, or using some other method, it can be a good idea to start with the RVUs that cost the most. Whether they cost more because of the time or resources involved, or because they are used the most frequently, these are often the RVUs that determine the profitability of the practice. For example, if your RVUs are below the national benchmark average, but you have a high patient volume, you may need to take a look at the efficiency of your practice in order to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Get the math right&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at an accurate RVU is more complicated than simply taking the purchase costs and adding subjective charges to get a number. The base price of a product or service is not merely the cost associated with acquiring the item or performing the service. Other factors that add to the initial cost must be added to determine the true value. The following variables must be taken into account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Labor costs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Building lease costs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Equipment costs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Office supply costs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Malpractice and insurance premium costs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Time&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Necessary clinical skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are costs that need to be incorporated into the RVUs to keep a practice profitable. It is also important to adjust for a geographic variance. It is absolutely possible to calculate RVUs manually, and for smaller practices, this can be the least expensive choice. Especially for practices with tenured, experienced team members able to help with determining RVUs, it can be a way to encourage staff involvement and elevate thinking. Larger practices may want to consider investing in software or calculation programs and automating the process as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

While you may have a clear idea of what this progression looks like from the perspective of a medical practitioner, visualizing the funnel from the viewpoint of the patient can help you understand why each step in the process is essential and focus on strategies that your target audience is more likely to respond to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The stages of the marketing funnel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several different representations used to explain the steps of the marketing funnel, which can range from three to eight stages or more. However, no matter the number or label used, the process typically covers awareness, consideration, and purchase. Each of these steps affects the patient experience in a unique way and depends on the other to guide the individual towards making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Awareness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the marketing funnel, often called lead generation from an advertiser’s point of view, is the moment when the patient first becomes aware of your medical practice and services. There are several ways a person can come to this step, including exposure through viewing an advertisement placed on a social media site, seeing your practice on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/&quot;&gt;search engine ranking page&lt;/a&gt; after searching for a related keyword such as “family dentist near Roseville,” or hearing about your practice from a friend or family member. While there is much more that goes in advertising and targeting from your end as the medical practitioner or owner of a medical office, the introduction should feel natural and simple to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consideration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After patients become aware of your brand, they transition into the consideration stage. For people who do not connect with your practice or are not in need of the services you offer, the interaction may end here. For those who are part of your target audience or within your scope of influence, this step is critical for securing a conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient wants to know that you offer the needed services, have a good reputation, and are qualified to do the job at hand. While some patients may be ready to employ your services quickly, others may need more time in the consideration stage. These individuals may explore your website for reviews and testimonials, browse through any &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/&quot;&gt;educational content on your site&lt;/a&gt;, search for your educational background and areas of expertise, or ask questions and engage with your office to determine if it is a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Purchase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the patient makes the choice to call your office and sent up an initial appointment. Even after deciding to get your services, however, patients may hesitate or forget to follow through. Automated email reminders, calls from a staff member, free consultation offers, or invitations to a special webinar can all help guide them to finalizing the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

This number measures the size of outstanding accounts based on average sales days instead of units of currency. The DSO can be quickly calculated by dividing the total of accounts receivable from a certain period of time by the complete sum of credit sales during that same amount of time, then dividing the answer by how many days were in that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/d/days-sales-outstanding-dso&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/d/days-sales-outstanding-dso&quot;&gt;Investing Answers&lt;/a&gt; suggests the DSO is crucial because it is a measure of how quickly a company collects money, which directly correlates to the efficiency and profitability of the company. A medical practice is no exception. Comparing the DSO of several practices can show which ones are better at managing credit and efficiently using receivables to foster growth. A practice can also compare its DSO numbers over time to tell whether it is becoming more or less efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ways to reduce the DSO for your practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your practice has a high DSO, there are several ways both the staff and patients can help lower it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examine customer payment terms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practice with looser payment terms generally has a higher DSO than one with very strict terms. How long do patients have to pay a bill once they leave the office? Is payment required at the time of service? Establishing a balance of common industry standards, the DSO of your practice and the needs of the patients can help pinpoint the necessary terms to offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Switch to automated billing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly for practices with a high ratio of patients to staff members, it can be a good idea to have an automated billing process. This helps ensure bills are sent out on time and do not get lost in the shuffle. Simply put, the faster patients receive a bill, the faster they can pay it. If your practice still sends out paper statements and bills, you may want to consider electronic billing. Online invoicing and billing make it possible for a patient to receive and pay a bill the same day it is sent out instead of days or weeks later. This method also allows payments to be easily tracked as opposed to checks and payment stubs that can be more labor-intensive to monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pay attention to invoicing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if your billing is already automated, it is important to be detailed when inputting patient and invoicing information. A bill sent to the wrong patient or address will not get paid. Are the invoices accurate and being sent out on time? Even small errors in amounts due or account numbers can end up costing the practice significant amounts of money. Spot-checking invoices is a good way to find and fix common errors that can delay payments and increase the DSO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Offer multiple methods of payment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to get paid is obviously to ask the patients for payments upfront. However, there are cases where patients may not be able to pay the full amount at once and need to spread out payments. Rather than sending out monthly statements and bills and relying on the patient to mail a check or call and make a payment over the phone, consider having an online payment portal. A well-planned internet payment system can allow patients to view statements and make payments quickly and easily. The less work involved with paying a bill, the more likely and faster a patient is to pay it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consistently follow up with patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following up can be one of the most effective ways to make sure patients do not ignore invoices. Email reminders and text message reminders typically work well, and phone call reminders can be even better because of the personal touch of talking directly to another human being. This can be particularly helpful with bills that are past due. To keep your practice&amp;#8217;s DSO where it should be, which is ideally 10-15 days beyond the terms of sale, staff members need to be proactive about sending reminders or making phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Offer incentives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from costing the practice money, offering early payment discounts can be a smart way to keep cash flow in the practice instead of tied up in accounts receivable. It can be a win for both the practice and the patientd, because the patients pay less and the practice gets the capital sooner. Having a faster cash flow, getting better rates from creditors, and saving interest on loan fees are just a few ways receiving faster patient payments can improve the balance sheet of a practice. Charging a late payment penalty is another option to help offset some of the costs the practice incurs when the billing moves to a collections department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stay committed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowering your DSO does not happen overnight. If your goal is to reduce it by 20 days, it can take several months to see significant progress. While it can be motivating to see that number drop, the initial excitement of making a difference can wear off quickly. Effecting significant improvements and sustaining them long-term requires a change of habits in everyone from the executives to the billing department. Setting expectations for the staff regarding accounts receivable and regularly discussing DSO metrics can help maintain focus and ensure all the effort put into lowering the DSO is not wasted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We can help you improve practice management&lt;/h2&gt;

According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301787889_Burnout_in_DentistryAn_overview&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301787889_Burnout_in_DentistryAn_overview&quot;&gt;study done at ResearchGate&lt;/a&gt;, dental employees are getting burned out due to a disconnect between the demands and resources of the job and personal goals, skills, and abilities. Employers can turn this work exhaustion around through practice management that is fun, exciting, and different. Make your employees want to come to work with these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The importance of making work fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees who dread coming to work are far less likely to put full effort into the job. This not only affects everyone’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/&quot;&gt;mental and physical health&lt;/a&gt;, but it can also negatively impact your business. Patients may notice when an employee seems lethargic or disinterested, and in an industry that is based heavily on in-person communication and personal connections, this can prevent patients from returning to your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ways to improve staff satisfaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are endless ways you can make work more enjoyable for employees and yourself. To get an idea of what will truly benefit your employees, ask around for ideas or run through suggestions. See what seems to click with them and what should be avoided. To get started, here are four methods that can improve work attitudes and rejuvenate the office atmosphere.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Focus on communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication is key regardless of what industry you work in, and there are specific aspects that you can focus on to positively impact your employees. For example, simply showing appreciation now and then for work efforts can boost your team’s confidence. Prioritizing organization can make sure that everyone understands what is going on in the office and prevents frustration over miscommunications. Listening is a key part of communication, so when you ask your employees what can be fixed, show that you listened by actually addressing the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Try flexible hours&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing flexible work hours can demonstrate that you care about employees’ personal lives. If an important event or emergency arises, an employee with flexible hours can feel confident in changing the work schedule without the fear of being ostracized. This helps reduce the stresses of the work-life balance without shorting either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Organize office-wide activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun games, happy hour get-togethers after work, and charitable activities, such as volunteering for community service, can help everyone bond and learn to work effectively together. Team-building in other areas can help employees appreciate each other more back in the office. Social gatherings, such as throwing everyone a party at the end of the year to celebrate successes, allows people to connect on a personal level that does not involve work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Improve the office space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes little changes are what people notice the most. Decorating the office for seasons or holidays can liven everyone’s day and break up the regular pace. Putting in plants, adding new furniture that optimizes the office’s workspace, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240985&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240985&quot;&gt;providing food&lt;/a&gt; can energize everyone and increase office production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discover more great changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevating employees e can benefit everyone who enters your medical practice, including both employees and patients.

Dental healthcare may seem scary<a class="moretag" href="/how-to-discuss-treatments-with-patients/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-discuss-treatments-with-patients/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-discuss-treatments-with-patients/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 20:00:08 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a dental practitioner, you understand that you may have to deal with cautious patients. Dental healthcare may seem scary to some. When it comes to speaking to patients about treatment plans, the way you present the options and recommendations is as important as the plan itself. Getting a patient to feel confident enough in your practice to follow through with treatment is critical to your practice&amp;#8217;s financial success. Practice management can help get jittery patients to not only understand their options but also to sign up for the recommendations for overall health improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Presenting a Treatment Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a consultation occurs and all issues are identified, the focus needs to shift to providing a sufficient explanation of what happens next. Your treatment recommendations likely go beyond what is medically necessary in the short term. By having a team member give a clear and concise description of the treatment plan, the patient may be more apt to continue it past the crucial first phase. Learning how to present the treatment plan and the tools your practice uses to do so are critical steps in gaining patient confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Remain positive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who put off dental care typically do so either out of fear or lack of finances. One way to overcome the first obstacle is by remaining upbeat during your explanation of the treatment plan. When discussing the dental issues that need fixing sooner, identify and explain the health consequences of delaying treatment. Speak compassionately and empathize with the worry patients may express. This is a good time to educate the patient on the practitioner&amp;#8217;s credentials and how the practice provides superior care before, during, and after treatment plans. Remind patients that according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475&quot;&gt;MayoClinic.org&lt;/a&gt;, oral health impacts other body systems and may contribute to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heart disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You use technical terms around the office, but when it comes to patient interaction, less is more. This does not mean you should speak down to patients, but modify your vocabulary to use fewer formal medical terms. Give appropriate examples and scenarios to aid in your explanation. Referring to amalgam fillings as silver is a perfectly acceptable switch that can get your message through on a level understood by the patient. Use online resources through your patient portal to illustrate procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Present the numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients have budgets. When presenting treatment plans, try to have the exact costs. If you can have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/&quot;&gt;estimate for insurance purposes&lt;/a&gt;,  ensure that the patient understands the number may change. A patient will not likely continue onto suggested treatments if the requisite procedures cost far more than initially indicated. Since your practice relies on retaining patients, presenting accurate pricing goes a long way to gaining trust.&lt;/p&gt;

The primary goal of your website is not only to get people to see it but also to get them to choose your clinic over others. Converting those views into clients takes a little more effort in this ultra-competitive business. Walking through a conversion funnel allow you to see how page views become in-person appointments by following a user&amp;#8217;s path from website visits through conversion. Take a closer look at how content marketing can help drive traffic through the proper funnels and straight to your front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the stages of the funnel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term conversion funnel describes the way people go from browsing the web to becoming your clients. It maps out the path people take from curiosity to appointments to improve your website&amp;#8217;s chances of conversions in the future. There are three basic stages to a funnel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the first interaction a potential client has with your practice. It often occurs when your website is returned as a search result to a person looking up a medical term or condition.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt; At this point, the user is doing some serious perusing on your practice&amp;#8217;s site. Blog posts created to capture the greatest interest are effective ways to pull clients from the awareness stage down into the evaluation or middle funnel. Users who spend quality time in this step are genuinely interested in the services your practice provides.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversion:&lt;/strong&gt; Your ultimate goal is to get this window-shopper to pick up the phone or click a link to book an appointment. Getting users to drop down into this sector takes know-how of creating content and fine-tuning search analytics to answer relevant questions and earn a certain measure of authority and respect. When a client converts, it is because something about what you presented gained a measure of trust. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Google Analytics to transition visitors to clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a website that maximizes the conversion funnel, it is imperative to track a client&amp;#8217;s journey through your page so you can fine-tune for the kind of content that leads to a higher conversion rate. Using Google Analytics can give you a better understanding of your webpage&amp;#8217;s visitors and how they interact with your content. Breaking down the information can help you refine the way traffic is driven to and through your page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who views your page?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google Analytics page provides a wealth of insight into the type of traffic your website gets. Familiarize yourself with the users who visit your website, or rather, the data associated with them. When people conduct online searches, their IP address is recorded in Google. That address allows Google to track their activity online, including any visits to your website. Google Analytics can generate a report telling you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The average times the same IP address has visited your site&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The amount of time the user spends engaged with your content&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The pages visited on your site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding this information can allow you to see if the content you create correlates to repeat visits from users. By tracking user engagement, you can see how many visitors convert to in-house appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What content gets the most traffic?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, healthcare practices relied solely on word of mouth to gain new clients. This most often came in the form of friends or family recommending a practice to someone new. However, the internet not only allows clients to find their own providers but also allows you the opportunity to attract people you would not have gotten otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content you create can make or break your ability to funnel new users into becoming clients. By analyzing the page hits and time spent on your site, you can make changes to not only the way you present information, but the type of information visitors to your website are most interested in seeing. You may see a pattern emerge that takes your practice&amp;#8217;s web presence in a different direction. For example, if you focus mostly on product awareness but see that users to your site tend to spend the most time reading about signs and symptoms of conditions, then you may want to create more content centered around this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the bounce rate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your practice&amp;#8217;s website probably has multiple layers and pages to offer the greatest chance that users would remain on a page and eventually schedule an appointment. When looking at Google Analytics, you may notice something called the bounce rate. As explained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/10/30/seven-google-analytics-metrics-you-need-to-track-to-grow-your-business/#1c66e6fb6180&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/10/30/seven-google-analytics-metrics-you-need-to-track-to-grow-your-business/#1c66e6fb6180&quot;&gt;Forbes.com&lt;/a&gt;, this number indicates how often someone opened a single page on your website and then left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no further data available to track these users because they failed to engage with your webpage beyond that single hit. This may be someone who followed a Google search result, such as a featured snippet, to your page, and then closed it without going any further through. A fairly high bounce rate is not necessarily a bad thing unless you notice that certain pages seem to encourage users to leave your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if your homepage gets a high number of quick visits, then there is likely something that is either broken (like a link) or not engaging enough to warrant a user&amp;#8217;s time to investigate further. Consider making your homepage more inviting and personal. Sometimes all it can take to retain a user is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/&quot;&gt;add photos of your office&lt;/a&gt; and staff at work. Sometime specific articles may have higher bounce rates, either because the subject matter is not popular or perhaps the content is confusingly presented. A bounce rate analysis can help you figure out what needs fixing to retain users on your page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We can provide solutions&lt;/h2&gt;

These terms cover different aspects of using search engines to gain visibility online and guide patients to your website, where they hopefully make the choice to learn more about your services. As you analyze your office’s goals, knowing how to use SEO and SEM can help you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/10/22/how-to-get-a-higher-roi-on-your-marketing-campaigns/#7c482c747501&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/10/22/how-to-get-a-higher-roi-on-your-marketing-campaigns/#7c482c747501&quot;&gt;increase your return&lt;/a&gt; and use your money and time effectively.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The difference between SEO and SEM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can use SEO and SEM successfully, you must first understand the differences between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is SEO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEO stands for search engine optimization, which is the process of increasing traffic to your website and focusing on your target audience by ranking high on search engines when someone searches for a word or phrase related to your line of work. While it is common for businesses to pay for someone to handle the SEO of a website, this method relies entirely on free, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing&quot;&gt;organic strategies&lt;/a&gt;. There are several essential components that affect how well a site is optimized for search engines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyword optimization: &lt;/strong&gt;Choosing the right keywords and phrases and utilizing them effectively is the most important part of on-page SEO. This involves performing keyword research, considering placement of words, and creating content.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backlinking:&lt;/strong&gt; One way to efficiently boost your site’s reputation is by including backlinks to other trustworthy sources throughout your content. You should also manage any other sites that link to your page and consider disavowing any questionable sources.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crawlability: &lt;/strong&gt;A high-functioning backend is also important for SEO. Having a site map, ensuring the server is secure, and hosting pages that load quickly all contribute to the technical crawlability of the site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is SEM?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than rely on organic content to boost your office’s website, you can also include search engine marketing in your strategy. This practice uses paid advertisements to make a site more visible on search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEM often refers to paid-per-click advertising, which means you are only charged for the ad if the patient clicks on it. However, like SEO, keyword research is essential for ensuring a large number of high-quality leads encounter the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to utilize both SEO in and SEM in a campaign&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most marketing campaigns benefit from using a combination of SEO and SEM. Knowing how much to use of each depends on your budget, current goals, industry, and website performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For new offices with the primary goal of gaining brand awareness and visibility, SEM offers immediate results. Even if the website is not optimized, it can still gain visibility while you finetune those details. If keywords are very competitive for your industry, PPC ads make it easier to appear on the search engine ranking page than it would with SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, SEO offers long-lasting results that are not limited by a temporary ad. For well-established brands with quality organic content and a strong website, improving SEO has notable benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take your marketing efforts to the next level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we understand how SEM and SEO work together to make a marketing campaign successful.

When that person leaves without<a class="moretag" href="/techniques-for-reducing-bounce-rate/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/techniques-for-reducing-bounce-rate/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/techniques-for-reducing-bounce-rate/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 20:00:23 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When people visit your website, you want them to stay for as long as possible. When that person leaves without exploring the site past the page originally clicked on, this is called a bounce. The bounce rate is calculated based on the number of people who exit your webpage before clicking on any of your other pages. The more people who leave prematurely, the higher your website’s bounce rate is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher bounce rates are bad for business because they mean fewer visitors are converting. Converting can involve completing any number of actions, such as sending a digital message, filling out the newsletter signup form, or buying a product. By decreasing bounce rate, you can increase your audience and business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ways to reduce bounce rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great bounce rate is around 30-50%, while a poor bounce rate can land above 80%. You can view your overall bounce rate and the bounce rate of specific pages on Google Analytics or another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close&quot;&gt;analytic alternative&lt;/a&gt;. Identifying which pages have the highest rate on your website can give you a specific area to focus on instead of trying to rework the content design and SEO strategy of your entire site at once. Here are changes you can make to a page to decrease bounce rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make content easier to read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large blocks of text are much harder to digest than text that is broken up and formatted to please the eye. Using subheadings, bullet points, images, charts, and occasional bolded keywords can make it easier for people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/&quot;&gt;scan your content&lt;/a&gt; and find links to other pages. If you have various types of pages (blogs, articles, contact pages, etc.), create style guides for each that make sure all posts adhere to the right format and are easier to read.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Employ strong calls to action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiment with calls to action to see what attracts readers to click on services you offer and engage more with your site. Some may stand stronger above the rest, and you may find that others do not receive as much attention. By establishing a powerful call to action, you entice visitors to sign up for newsletters and explore more parts of your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improve usability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your site should be appealing from the first second a visitor lands on it. Anything that looks clunky, jarring, or confusing is likely to lose newcomers quickly, and in an age when online attention spans last mere seconds, creating a captivating hook is essential. Double-check that your site is easy to navigate and that finding information is not a hassle. Your site should also be able to translate smoothly from any device and screen size. A majority of users browse the internet on a mobile device, so the last thing you want is a site that looks terrible on a small screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reach out for more great ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every website is different, and the creation of user-friendly, attractive pages should be tailored to individual business needs. Discover new ways to improve your site’s aesthetic and minimize bounce rate, and &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; to see how to change your site to fit the latest marketing trends.   &lt;/p&gt;

More practices are moving toward this approach to retain current patients and establish relationships with new ones. By designating a specific area of your site to communicate with patients, you are increasing beneficial information flow between your business and patients while improving your SEO strategies. To take full advantage of your website, you must understand the various forms of communication you can implement and how to optimize usage.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Communication options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways you can communicate daily with patients. In fact, offering an online communication service usually opens your business up to optimal 24/7 service for anyone who needs help. It also provides more &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/&quot;&gt;access to mobile users&lt;/a&gt;, who make up about half of all online interactions. You can incorporate more than one of these options into your site to increase accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Online messaging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those familiar with social media will know that online messaging is a common form of communication across apps and websites. Almost all banks, law offices, and online stores have turned to online messaging to quickly and concisely interact with customers. You can create a segment in the sidebar of your website or a popup message window that allows visitors to send a message immediately — whichever your site architecture accommodates. By putting a place for messages at the forefront of your site, you provide an easy and effective route for customers to reach you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many other communication options available today, it can be easy to think that emails are going out of style. This is far from true, and many companies actually generate a large amount of business through a regularly scheduled email newsletter. While many people may not yet be familiar or comfortable with online messaging, emails are simple and reliable. Extra security measures may be needed to ensure patient privacy to help patients and physicians feel more at ease. Overall, email is cost-effective, and you can include your address on a contact information page on your site for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Integrated online messaging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to regular online messaging, the integrated system goes a step further to include patient information for the physician during a live communication. A physician can view the patient’s medical record while talking to them, and all messages automatically become a part of the patient’s record as the conversation progresses. This gives patients necessary connectivity while providing physicians with the tools for a successful engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why online communication matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people, especially those of younger generations, feel more comfortable communicating via online sources than over the phone. Broadening the number of opportunities patients have to connect with you makes it easier to accommodate different schedules and lifestyles. Of course, simply having an online communication system is not enough — you still need to incorporate an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2017/02/09/how-to-build-strong-customer-relationships-online/#57f492341295&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2017/02/09/how-to-build-strong-customer-relationships-online/#57f492341295&quot;&gt;inviting personal touch&lt;/a&gt; to make a human connection even though the interaction is through a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reach out for a greater understanding of online communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never let a lack of knowledge about online tactics prevent you from getting the most out of your website. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; for more insights on expanding your online audience and generating engaging content to increase communication with your patients.&lt;/p&gt;

According to a survey of mobile usage conducted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017.&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017.&quot;&gt;statista.com&lt;/a&gt; between 2015 and 2020, more than half of online traffic worldwide occurred on a mobile device. Chances are, customers are visiting your site on their phones more than any other device. It is crucial to design site architecture that can translate from a desktop user to a mobile user without issue. Here are strategies to develop a site that optimizes mobile use while still remaining accessible to all other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going from desktop to mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user should be able to flip from a desktop browser to a mobile browser and still recognize your pages as the same site, just in a slightly different format. A site that fails to load properly on anything other than a desktop is more likely to lose potential customers visiting for the first time. Before you create an entirely separate page specifically for mobile use, check to see if your site already has a responsive design that can convert the layout from one device to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Website responsiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsiveness refers to a site’s ability to appear cohesive, uniform, and similar on any device, regardless of each device’s screen size. The site’s pages and links should remain the same, with small changes that adapt it for easy mobile use. With newer website templates, this may already be the case. If not, there are plenty of tools available online to help design a website with proper responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategies to make a mobile site easier to use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before designing your mobile site, answer several key questions about your audience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What information is your audience looking for most often?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What questions and answers do visitors frequently search for on your website?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What pages are most popular on your site?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What do you want customers to know about your business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people use mobile devices — frequently phones — they are usually looking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/&quot;&gt;quick answers to short questions&lt;/a&gt;. Identifying those questions can help you establish SEO and ideal content for mobile users specifically. You can use Google Analytics to track the traffic that comes to your site to determine what answers people get on your site. From there, consider the following points to implement to make this content more accessible on a mobile platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consistent screen width&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more irritating than having to scroll horizontally to see an entire webpage on your phone. Make sure that the full width of your site is visible on each screen size. This may mean changing how content appears on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expandable images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since phones offer a limited viewing space, many users prefer images that can expand. This makes it easier to see products and pictures that appear smaller than usual on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Single tabs only&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving between separate browser tabs on a small device can be challenging. Ensuring that links to other pages remain in the same tab can minimize user frustration and route customers back to your site.&lt;/p&gt;

When creating a strategy for content marketing, you should always have both user experience and search engine visibility in mind. If used correctly, implementing &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/service/faq-page#:~:text=FAQ%20pages%20include%20a%20series,for%20both%20customers%20and%20employees.&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/service/faq-page#:~:text=FAQ%20pages%20include%20a%20series,for%20both%20customers%20and%20employees.&quot;&gt;FAQ pages&lt;/a&gt; and sections allows you to accomplish both goals simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of including commonly asked questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a frequently asked questions section to your webpages and blog posts can be time-consuming, but the payoff is worth the added effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Search engine optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of SEO is to make your practice more visible on search engines by tailoring your content to rank better on the results page. When you consider that many people enter questions into the search box when researching a topic, it makes sense that researching and including a frequently asked questions in your content can help people land on your page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patient loyalty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a patient has a question that your content successfully answers, this reflects positively on your practice and helps establish a positive relationship with the visitor. Potential patients want to know that your medical staff is qualified to provide the needed services, so displaying your expertise in your field builds trust. Even if visitors initially land on your page looking for specific information, there is a higher potential for them to become interested in your office and the services you offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;User experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy-to-use, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/websites&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/websites&quot;&gt;professional website&lt;/a&gt; impresses visitors and guides them toward making a purchase or learning more about your service, while a nonresponsive site that is difficult to navigate can have the opposite effect, causing potential clients to look for a different practice. A frequently asked question section or page offers a user-friendly layout that allows patients to quickly scan the information and focus only on what is relevant to the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips for optimizing your commonly asked questions section&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get better results from a question and answer section, you must first develop a strategy and research what topics to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic ways to find commonly asked questions is to do a Google search to find these. If you already have a list of keywords you want to include in your content, start by searching these terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times, Google has a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/06/23/how-brands-can-optimize-googles-people-also-ask-feature/#31abdaeb1159&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/06/23/how-brands-can-optimize-googles-people-also-ask-feature/#31abdaeb1159&quot;&gt;People Also Ask&lt;/a&gt;” section that includes questions people often search about the topic, along with an answer found on a specific webpage. For instance, if you search for “tooth decay” you may see questions like “How is tooth decay treated?” and “What are the stages of tooth decay?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To potentially be featured under this section and to rank higher on the Google results page when a patient searches these specific questions, include them in your FAQ section with keyword-rich answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let us help you improve your content marketing strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

Creating a shiny new website for your company is only half the battle — the rest involves filling in content that is engaging, useful, and informative to your customers. Keywords within that content are crucial for designing search engine optimization to bring to your site customers who might not know about your business and what you do. To take advantage of the latest search trends, you need to know why certain keywords and subjects are important for your business and how to use them effectively in content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The importance of search trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search trends can be broken down into several categories. One involves seasonal change, e.g., consumers may be more interested in buying products during the summer than in the winter. Another is all about keywords, which are specific words or short phrases you use in the content of your website that a search engine matches to the search words someone has typed in. The more you incorporate those keywords, the higher your content will rank in engines like Google. Learning how to use these trends to guide your &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/&quot;&gt;latest article or blog topics&lt;/a&gt; can keep your content relevant and appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To narrow down keywords that fit within the context of your work, you first have to figure out what consumers are searching for and what they are not. You can use the latest trends and analytics to narrow down keywords that match what your clients type into Google. Consider using a mix of short-tail and long-tail keywords to diversify your SEO and attract a wide variety of clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Short-tail keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, short-tail keywords are made up of three or fewer words. These are often incredibly broad and more frequently searched for. There are benefits and drawbacks to using shorter keywords. Your content is more likely to rank with a shorter keyword because so many articles can fit in the general topic. This allows for more people, particularly new customers, to find your page. However, your webpage will be competing with numerous other pages with the same keyword, sometimes in the thousands, making it less likely to rank higher in the results list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Long-tail keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to attract customers looking for something more specific, long-tail keywords are ideal. Longer keywords and phrases narrow down the search significantly, and while a keyword over three words long may not be searched for as frequently as shorter ones, someone who types it in is probably looking for exactly what you have to offer. It also makes your site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274809&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274809&quot;&gt;more likely to rank higher&lt;/a&gt; in the list of search engine results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools to discover search trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use any of these tools for search analytics to discover search trends and keywords:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Matomo&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Woopra&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GoSquared&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;FoxMetrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have established a list of keywords and trends, you can confidently start using them in your content marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

However, identifying which keywords or keyword phrases will deliver the desired results can be difficult without fundamental knowledge on the subject. No matter the current size or impact of your office’s website, it is essential you are ready with your toolbox of sources and methods for using the most effective keywords on every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consider your specialty and customer base&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you even jump on your computer to starting searching for keywords to include in your content, you need to first take time to brainstorm what your office has to offer and what your customers want and expect from your services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Determine your niche&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you may assume that using broad keywords will help you draw in a larger group of people, focusing on certain specialties or your business&amp;#8217;s niche has several benefits. For one, common, more general terms, such as “dentist” or “chiropractor,” are often more highly competed for, making it very difficult for smaller companies to rank well on search engines when up against well-established, national brands. In contrast, honing in on more specific services you offer or areas you specialize in, such as “GERD treatment” or “children dentistry” reduces the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, focusing your keyword research on your niche allows you to better target the exact type of customers who are likely to be interested in your services. For instance, if someone has a root canal that needs to be addressed, using the term “root canal treatment” can guide this individual to your page. This not only helps generates leads but is much more likely to result in a conversion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus on location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a medical professional, you likely have an office that serves a specific area. Many customer searches including a local component, so centering your keywords on the city, state, or region in which you offer your services is an easy and effective way to better target your intended audience and to potentially rank on the first page of search engines. This includes taking both broad and specific terms and including a location in the keyword phrase, such as “TMJ doctor Spokane” or “orthodontist Sacramento area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use tools to find effective keywords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of results-producing keyword research is using the right tools to help you find keywords that fit your niche and target audience. Since many people use Google as their primary search engine, using Google-specific resources can be helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google Search Console&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google Trends&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google Keyword Planner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also third-party tools to explore, including SEM Rush, Keyword Tool, Moz Keyword Explorer, Ahrefs Keyword Explorer, and SpyFu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gain even more visibility on search engines&lt;/h2&gt;

Writing great, engaging content is not enough to pull in a wider audience. Your website needs to consistently top the results page on Google and other search engines to catch customers who randomly search for a product you offer — after all, most people are likely to click on just the first five results. Identifying keywords that will boost your website rank is a good start, but it is not all you can do. Understanding how to analyze data about rankings and pageviews can help you strengthen weak points across the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking full advantage of analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning how to read and assess the data from your analytics software can help you develop new content marketing strategies that improve your site’s search engine optimization. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/01/02/nine-things-to-know-about-google-analytics/#1083137f6cb9&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/01/02/nine-things-to-know-about-google-analytics/#1083137f6cb9&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; and other comparable software guide you to identify keywords that your target audience searches for, discover your most popular pages, and help you generate more beneficial leads. Here are steps for getting the most out of your search analytics.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Search for organic landing pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advantages of using analytic software is that you can search for organic landing pages. These are the pages of your website that people visit the most frequently simply by typing in a search word or phrase into an engine without being brought there by advertisements. Discovering your most popular landing pages are essential because it tells you what your audience enjoys and finds interesting on your site. You can then create links on your popular pages to other related content, which builds a great internal linking system that also helps your site rate better on Google overall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Measure the quality of visitors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of site visitors and length of pageviews are quantitative data that are easy to measure, but how do you measure the quality of those who see your site? You can judge quality by determining how many people end up on your website because of organic SEO. Furthermore, an organic search that results in leads (customers who give you contact information, like an email signup) is more valuable than an organic search that does not. Use this data to see how it stands up to different marketing campaigns that you implement through advertisements or social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update popular pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On any software, it is simple to see what pages are your top performers. Make it a habit to regularly check how pages are performing and where improvements can be made. If a page has significantly lost organic traffic, use active marketing tactics for it (like pay-per-click ads). Some pages may only need an &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/&quot;&gt;update in content&lt;/a&gt;, while others might require a change in keywords. Look carefully at what links attract the most clicks to other content on your site. Constantly analyzing and refining your content layout and information can optimize the most popular pages so that you receive more pageviews and more business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identify searches that lead to your site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fantastic element of your analytical toolbox is the ability to see what visitors searched for before clicking on your website. It is considerably easier to determine keywords to include in your content when you can view each customer’s search terms. The overall list of search words can be overwhelming, so filter it down by matching keywords to corresponding pages and focus on the pages that have a greater chance of rating higher in the results list. By placing emphasis on the right keywords and most successful pages, you can increase your online ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assess campaigns on other sites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to tracking the stats on your own site, you can also track ad campaigns that you have on third-party websites. You can place email and promotional campaigns in a single list to see how they compare to one another. Use the list to clearly see the campaigns that generate the greatest traffic to your site and the content that attracts your main target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software for analyzing your ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics is a popular software for a reason: It is reliable, comprehensive, and highly detailed — but that should not keep you from trying other software too. Knowing what your options are can help you decide what is right for your business. Some companies prefer to monitor SEO and organic pageviews through multiple analytic programs to understand exactly where improvements can be made. Here are alternative options if you are exploring new avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GoSquared&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This software is great for those who want to add a little extra to the regular analytics software. Companies can improve relationships with customers with GoSquared’s live chat option. You can also research customer browsing histories to investigate keywords and topics that led them to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Matomo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are changing over to Matomo from Google Analytics, you do not need to worry about losing valuable data that is stored in Google. Matomo allows you to transfer old data into it to continue current analysis. This is also a good option for businesses looking to ensure security, as you can use it on your private server (the cloud is available too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FoxMetrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get a better handle on customer information, like the kinds of keywords that are searched for to find your page, consider FoxMetrics. This tool stores all of your data in a single bank for quick access and new reports, making it easy to research the keywords that drive the most traffic to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Woopra&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woopra is all about instant response and service with a support team that is available to help with marketing and sales. The team can even respond to messages or new leads as soon as they happen in real time on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn how to improve your online ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that all analytical tools come with a steep learning curve with information and data that might be difficult to discern right away. To get a solid start with your software, &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to assess your data and build a stronger site.&lt;/p&gt;

In a world where many consumers and clients rely on<a class="moretag" href="/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 19:00:20 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Building a practice website for search engine optimization is important. In a world where many consumers and clients rely on what they read on the internet, having a page that ranks highly in search returns can make or break the traffic through your practice. When a potential client takes a look at your site, you want to be sure that you have created the kind of content marketing that keeps them reading and, even better, has them calling to make an appointment. One page you may want to consider incorporating is one that answers frequently asked questions. Since there are almost always general and common questions, getting them out of the way up front may improve the user&amp;#8217;s impression of your practice immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasons FAQ pages may help elevate your practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your main objective on your practice web page is to get potential clients interested in your business. You want to entice them with colorful pictures, engaging blog content, and convincing reasons why they should choose you. The FAQ page offers another opportunity to peak reader interest, and according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/02/12/making-seo-a-game-changer-for-your-business/#698e6b2e26c4&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/02/12/making-seo-a-game-changer-for-your-business/#698e6b2e26c4&quot;&gt;Forbes.com&lt;/a&gt;, maximize SEO to elevate your practice&amp;#8217;s web presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Establishes trust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some medical issues may prove more difficult for clients to talk about than others. The FAQ section is the place where you can place sensitive and perhaps embarrassing client questions. As readers cycle through your site, give them the most uncomfortable queries relevant to your practice, and answer them in simple terms. This not only establishes you as an authority but as a practice that makes people feel at ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Informs clients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have information about your practice plastered all over your site. Including some &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-presenting-content-in-more-than-one-form/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-presenting-content-in-more-than-one-form/&quot;&gt;facts and figures in the FAQ section&lt;/a&gt; can go a long way with potential clients. Doing it here can serve a couple of purposes. It gives information to those who want to read about it. You also can control how insight into your practice is presented and what you choose to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Allows interaction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing a page that does not allow readers to interact with you may turn some people away. If set up correctly, the FAQ page can allow you to field questions from readers and add them to the list you have already compiled. Answering comments or questions shows potential clients that you are attentive and care enough to address further queries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Captures searches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently asked questions contain common SEO keywords. When a person starts looking for these terms, your FAQ page may come back in the search. When this happens, it gives your website more visibility and may even net you a new client. Ensuring that your entire site is SEO friendly can work to drive more business to your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We have solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team of pros at Doctor Genius is dedicated to working diligently towards getting your practice&amp;#8217;s website optimized for maximum traction. We have developed multiple ways to get this accomplished. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Give us a call&lt;/a&gt; today, and we can talk about how we can help build your web presence and get you more clients.&lt;/p&gt;

The internet has made it easier than ever for consumers to find providers beyond their local regions and to consult with physicians states or even countries away. While this ease of access is great for individuals, it creates a highly competitive landscape for health care providers, as you may well know. As a result, you as a provider should continually look for opportunities to optimize your site not just for search, but for local search. While SEO content is one of the strongest ways to do this, structured data — or “schema markup” — can put you well ahead of the competition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding structured data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured data markup helps define information in such a way that the search bots can better understand the context of your page, delivering “rich snippets.” HTML, on the other hand, simply tells the bots how to display text included in a tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Patel explains the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.&quot;&gt;ins and outs of schema markup&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, schema markup can help you create a virtual business card. While non-marked-up results pull from title tags and meta descriptions to return generic information about your practice, marked-up results can show users everything from your practice’s name to its ratings to its hours, all right there in the SERPs. Before rich snippets were introduced, this kind of data — numbers, ratings, etc. — were not understood by the search bots and, therefore, ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using structured data to reach local patients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious way structured data can help you reach and attract local patients is by helping Google read items such as your map and phone number so it can include that information in the SERPs. While your content probably mentions your city and state several times for SEO purposes, schema markup makes it possible to show potential patients exactly where you are located, down to the suite number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, location is just one factor patients consider before selecting a provider. Patients also want to find a provider who is in the right field, who offers their insurance, and who has stellar patient reviews. Unlike HTML tags, which offer you limited space to tell searchers what your practice is about, structured data lets you &lt;a href=&quot;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0&quot;&gt;describe a page in as detailed a manner as possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the “@type” section, you can describe the type of content your page promises. In the “@description” section, you can include what you do (“A cosmetic dentist with 15 years of perfecting smiles.”) and/or a list of insurance your practice accepts. The “aggregate rating” section lets you input your best and worst ratings, and Google will deliver the average.

Without the requisite knowledge to inform patients of options and effectively treat them, you will not only suffer a loss of business, but you also may suffer a loss of professional integrity. While it is essential to stay grounded in older routines and those products that are still relevant, newer tools may provide more opportunities to attract new clients and offer new options to existing ones. Understanding what happens from the time medical products are introduced until they become irrelevant may help when it comes to medical marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staying informed of new trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to providing the best options for patient treatment, technological trends and developments are crucial. The ability to introduce patients to a full array of potential solutions to health problems results in a higher rate of successful recovery. Keeping an eye on medical journals, doing independent research on clinical trials, and speaking with an equipment representative may prove sufficient to stay abreast of trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The stages of medical products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a new medical product becomes available, company reps strive to reach relevant practices. The more medical providers use it and prescribe it, the higher the chance that it will gain notoriety. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534&quot;&gt;thestreet.com&lt;/a&gt;, typical product lifecycle management contains four benchmarks: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Each of these stages requires unique marketing strategies to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing a new medical product to the market can prove difficult, especially if the first phase of the lifecycle is not successful. In the introduction, the company is trying to gain some awareness of the product. Activities during this time include promotions geared towards those medical practices that have patients who may benefit from the new product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the product finds a measure of success, the distributor will want to broaden its horizons and target other areas of the medical community that might utilize it. The distributor may start to change the branding of the product to make it more appealing to a broader audience. Something used primarily for one health condition may be pushed for aiding with another. As long as the data backs up the claims, providers may give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maturity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business strategy changes the more successful a product becomes. When product sales plateau, it is a signal that it has reached maturity. To keep the company&amp;#8217;s name at the forefront of the medical community, it now has to make some clear changes to the product or its marketing. In some cases, this results in a 2.0 version of the same item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Decline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When competitors introduce rival products, and sales start to decrease, the lifecycle is declining. This means that a company must either completely reformulate and reintroduce the product or come up with something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Help when you need it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convincing clients that your practice is on top of the latest medical products and trends gives them confidence that you are looking out for the best avenues for treatment.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class="moretag" href="/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 10:10:02 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Understanding Pillar Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;writing quality content for skimmers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; a couple months ago. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;three major Google algorithm updates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;across multiple core topic areas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Doctor Genius Content Packages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How Content Ignition Packages Work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How Keyword Content Packages Work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Why Content Packages Matter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Too often, businesses focus on how a site looks when they should construct it with search engine optimization and information flow in mind. By building your website with clientele needs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/&quot;&gt;SEO keywords&lt;/a&gt; as the driving point, you are more likely to attract a larger target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steps to successfully build site architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site architecture refers to every aspect of your website, including the smallest details that most visitors will not even see: design, layout, easy-to-read content, social media links, contact information, email list sign-ups, etc. Before jumping into design, start by identifying your goals and your customers. What do you want people to discover when landing on your homepage? What kind of visitors do you want your site to attract? Once you have defined these measures, you are ready to work on the following steps for building out your site architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Find your keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keywords are the essential tool customers use to find websites that are relevant to an online search. By incorporating the most commonly used keywords into your site, it is more likely to rank higher on the list of results. Consider using tools like Keyword Discovery or Wordtracker to explore keywords that fit your business and audience. Research the competitiveness of each keyword (how often it is used by others in your business), the frequency that each word or phrase is typed into search engines, and the specificity of them (if they are broad terms for customers beginning a search or specific terms for those who are looking for an exact product).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a site map&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A site map is made up of the layers within your website that generate a natural flow of information and link one page to the next. The map is usually designed based on a hierarchical structure, with categories, tags, and backlinks that separate out information in a logical order. The map should be easy to navigate so that a visitor can quickly find the information they are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus on aesthetics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to focus on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#395646be7645&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#395646be7645&quot;&gt;website’s appearance&lt;/a&gt; and how well it functions for your audience. This is just as important as establishing keywords and a site map since this is the part the customer actually pays attention to. A website that is confusing to navigate or lacks a clear, concise message on the landing page is more likely to lose viewers quickly. Use headlines and a short blurb at the top of your homepage to inform people about your business and guide visitors toward relevant information. Pictures can help break up text and make a page easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;

Part of that is building a web presence that returns high results when new clients are on the hunt for your type of care. Structured data is one tool that can be used to push your site to the top of search results. When working toward broadening your client base, utilizing diverse strategies like this can get your practice increased visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discover structured data basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like a shape sorter in preschool, structured data&amp;#8217;s purpose is to categorize and organize similar information. Like SEO, where keywords can generate a higher ranking in search results, structured data can promote a website by offering searchers a snapshot of information about your page. Structured data is similar to a meta description in that it gives a small amount of insight that is then filtered through search engines and displayed according to the terms set out in the markup language. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-is-structured-data/&quot;&gt;most common type of information filtered into structured data&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Photographs or graphics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Practice name and type&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ratings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Comments or reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data organized in this fashion cuts down the dependence on algorithms to fish for the search results. The structured data puts itself in the position for ranking more readily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boost your webpage ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorting information requires rules. Schema.org is the webpage that is responsible for coming up with the categories, structure, and, ultimately, the rules for how data is sorted. It sifts through published webpages and returns them according to these structured data rules. If you fashion your practice&amp;#8217;s website to maximize the established &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/sd-policies&quot;&gt;structured data rules&lt;/a&gt;, Google and other search engines are more likely to highlight your page at the top, in the rich results. The more prominent your webpage appears, the more visits you get, and the higher the conversion rate. Using the right data points may land your page in the rich results more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphics perform well with potential clients. Why? A webpage that is easy to read through and visually attractive tends to get a higher return rate than those that are devoid of color and images. Plus, when it comes to appealing to structured data, tagging a picture will help push it into the rich results faster. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/&quot;&gt;photos you choose&lt;/a&gt; for your practice&amp;#8217;s page should be relevant and not too overwhelming to sensitive people. Shy away from graphic illustrations or depictions of conditions, viruses, or injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ratings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your website&amp;#8217;s comment section is one place that may generate a lot of interest in your practice. Prospective clients like to review feedback to get a feel for the type of service you provide. Having your star rating or examples of client comments show up in rich results gives those people searching the chance to quickly see what public opinion has to say about your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

Clients rely heavily on reviews and site content when choosing<a class="moretag" href="/why-simple-and-concise-sentences-matter/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-simple-and-concise-sentences-matter/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-simple-and-concise-sentences-matter/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 19:00:04 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Creating valuable website content is a priority for medical practices. Clients rely heavily on reviews and site content when choosing a new provider. Separating your practice from similar ones may come down to content design and website readability. Keeping things such as language and sentence structure simple may not only boost your SEO ranking, but it can also capture more business. Find out how keeping things simple can make all the difference when trying to attract more clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Readers have a short attention span&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world runs at a quick pace, and building a practice page that caters to this is imperative. With the demands of work and family obligations, readers do not want to spend time conducting extensive research to find a provider. Websites that present information in a concise and precise manner tend to top the list in search results, in part due to the ease with which readers can get the information they want. The quicker visitors find what is needed from your site, the more likely they are to return or, better yet, make an appointment. Simplifying website content to make it user-friendly may result in more conversions than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing tools that simplify content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website has only a few seconds to grab a potential client&amp;#8217;s attention and keep them on the page. One way to do this is by creating content that is user friendly, eye-catching, and relevant. Using a more simplistic writing style is beneficial as it tends to reach a wider audience and keep them engaged longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Short sentences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a medical practice, you may believe that using an elevated vocabulary and complex sentence structure makes you sound like more of an expert. However, these things lead to fewer conversions because visitors cannot get the message fast enough. Long sentences can prove hard to follow and process. When readers need to read something more than once to understand it, they will likely move on to another site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Headings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the barrage of information available on the internet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/&quot;&gt;readers tend to skim articles&lt;/a&gt; to find what they want. Making content easy to scan is crucial for keeping readers engaged with your practice&amp;#8217;s website. Shorter sentences are faster to read. Paragraph headers make finding information at a glance easier by breaking up content in a concise and organized fashion. Headings, along with short sentences, make navigating a webpage for relevant insight quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People like visually appealing web pages. Using graphics on your practice&amp;#8217;s page allows potential clients a peek inside your office. Pictures can also draw the eye to other areas you wish to highlight. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm&quot;&gt;washington.edu&lt;/a&gt;, website graphics should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Guide readers to focus on essential portions of the text&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conform to the design of the site&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Not bog the site down with longer loading times&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Not take away from the content of the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Help is at the ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task of creating relevant and easily digestible content for your practice&amp;#8217;s website may feel overwhelming, but we can help.

Since then, however, search technology has evolved to incorporate artificial intelligence, which enables the search engine to deliver the most accurate results based on several variables, with keywords being just one of them. Google refers to this new and improved search as “semantic search” and scores websites based on their “semantic distance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The introduction of semantic search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantic search is not a new idea, though many brands are only just now incorporating the concept into their content marketing strategies. Back in 2013, Google realized that because &lt;a href=&quot;https://envato.com/blog/semantic-search/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://envato.com/blog/semantic-search/&quot;&gt;people communicate through conversations, not keywords&lt;/a&gt;, it was time to make some serious changes. As a result, it released the Hummingbird algorithm, which was designed to improve the search engine’s understanding of users’ search queries and deliver more accurate results faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous algorithms, which returned results based solely on keywords, Hummingbird understood that words have multiple meanings. Thus, it used AI to gather information about a user’s location, search history, spelling, and context to better understand the intent behind a search term. Google then used this data to quickly analyze full questions and rank results based on a particular user’s previously indexed content. Content that ranks higher is deemed to have a better “semantic score.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improving your semantic distance score&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of industry, optimizing content for semantic search is essential. However, because you are in the medical field, it is even more so for your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the simplest ways to optimize your medical content for semantic search is by using potential patients’ natural language. Medical professionals use highly technical language that is difficult to understand, much less spell or pronounce. Moreover, the medical field is replete with clinical jargon and acronyms with which the average person is unfamiliar. For instance, as a dentist, you may refer to a deep cleaning as “dental prophylaxis.” However, chances are low that anyone other than another dental professional searches for a dentist by that term. By simply describing these services as “teeth cleaning,” you can drastically expand your audience base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, improving your semantic score is not as simple as speaking your audience’s lingo. Google considers several variables when delivering results. Below are additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alexa.com/semantic-search/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://blog.alexa.com/semantic-search/&quot;&gt;strategies you can use to make semantic search work for you&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create highly targeted and useful content that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-neural-matching/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-neural-matching/&quot;&gt;turns the keyword into the topic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Optimize content for featured snippets (e.g., clearly answer questions in your content in concise ways and while targeting long-tail keywords)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search&quot;&gt;Optimize your content for voice search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use companion keywords, linguistic variations, and synonyms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add schema markup, or structured data, to the backend of your content to tell Google what your content is about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improve your semantic searchability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence may be what makes semantic search possible, but improving the semantic searchability of your site does not have to be so technical. In fact, all you really have to do to succeed with Google’s latest algorithms is to offer highly valuable content.

As experts from the University of Illinois have found, the mouth is the leading entryway to the body and is known as the window to a person&amp;#8217;s general health. A complete health dentist understands the connection between oral and overall health, running their practice on the application of modern dentistry with a focus on systemic relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who take proper hygiene measures to ensure their oral health is up to par may have fewer general health problems. Although many conditions, illnesses, and diseases are genetic, it is possible to combat others through proper oral hygiene. Understanding and applying the oral-systemic link can profoundly enhance patients’ health and well-being and provide new fundamentals that can improve your practice’s profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dental Conditions That Can Be Detected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular dental checkups provide dentists with information regarding a patient’s oral health and any problems they may have. A complete health dentist considers the oral-systemic link and conducts a more intensive, thorough examination of not just the mouth but the entire face, neck, and throat. This allows them to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a person’s health and come closer to diagnosing any dental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cavities and Cracked Teeth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavities and caries are the root causes of initial tooth decay caused by a breakdown of the tooth&amp;#8217;s enamel. Cavities are also the leading cause of tooth decay and tooth loss. According to the CDC, &amp;#8220;Untreated tooth decay can lead to [an] abscess (a severe infection) under the gums which can spread to other parts of the body and have serious, and in rare cases fatal, results.&amp;#8221; Infections include gum disease, and, in more severe cases, periodontal disease, which can both impact the body systems, especially the digestive and respiratory tracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cracked teeth can occur in a variety of ways: craze lines, cracked cusps, cracked teeth, and split teeth. Cracked or broken teeth can cause many oral and general health problems, as cracks give way to bacteria and infection. The Oral Health Foundation finds that &amp;#8220;If they are not treated, cracked teeth can lead to the death of the nerve, and an abscess might grow.&amp;#8221; An abscess is full of pus and bacteria, allowing bacteria to travel through various tracts to the body upon breaking open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gum and Periodontal Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gum disease is the leading cause of tooth decay, tooth loss, and, in severe cases, periodontal disease. Gum and periodontal disease, characterized by sensitive and inflamed gums, are linked to decay, resulting in tooth and bone loss when left untreated. Complete health dentists can detect early signs of gum disease and treat patients before it progresses to periodontal disease or general health conditions that are harder or less likely to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Oral Cancers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete health dentists screen for oral cancer during routine dental visits in an attempt to find lesions and signs of cancer or precancer symptoms. According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, 35,000 Americans will be diagnosed with oral cancer each year. Identifying sores, cysts, lesions, and other conditions of cancer early greatly aids in recovery benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medical Conditions That Can Be Detected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many oral and systemic conditions and diseases coincide, simultaneously affecting one another. Complete health dentists are aware of these conditions and the signs that would appear in the mouth, face, neck, or throat with such conditions. At the same time, oral conditions that can affect or cause general health conditions are also apparent and discussed to prevent or treat other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heart Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor oral health increases the risk of bacteria and infection entering the bloodstream, particularly affecting patients with artificial heart valves. The Mayo Clinic found that &amp;#8220;heart disease, clogged arteries, and stroke might be linked to the inflammation and infections that oral bacteria can cause.&amp;#8221; Periodontal disease, a severe form of gum disease, is associated with an increased risk of developing a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Diabetes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is another common condition that both affects and is affected by gum disease. The Mayo Clinic suggests, &amp;#8220;by reducing the body&amp;#8217;s resistance to infection, diabetes puts your gums at risk.” Gum and periodontal care can help manage diabetes while maintaining stability in blood sugar can also help mitigate gum and periodontal disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Conditions Affected by Oral Health:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Endocarditis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pregnancy: premature birth and low birth rate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thyroid&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medications That Affect Oral Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through extensive research, clinical trials, and experience, researchers have found that many medications for various health conditions affect patients’ oral health. Therefore, complete health dentists have a record of each patient’s medical history along with a list of all medications they have taken or are currently taking. They can also alter certain medications to fit the patient&amp;#8217;s needs and help curb their symptoms or side effects while offering guidance in navigating general health conditions during dental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of the most common medications that affect the mouth include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cancer medications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diabetes medications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Regulatory medicines (i.e., cardiovascular or thyroid)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Antidepressants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure medication&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pain relievers and sedatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NextLevel Practice Partnership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete health dentistry not only changed the way in which dentists view and treat patients, it also gave health professionals and patients across the board an enhanced idea of the extent to which dental and general health are connected. It allows patients to better care for themselves and dentists to provide better dialogue in terms of how conditions are being affected and the prevention or treatments required. Treating patients comprehensively also enables good patient-doctor rapport and builds stronger communication, which helps treat patients more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many dentists and practices are aware of the oral-systemic health connection and interested in converting their practice but may not know how to start. With its growing popularity, we have extended our knowledge and expertise about complete health dentistry through our collaboration with NextLevel Practice (NLP), led by visionary Gary Kadi.

Attracting people with eye-catching and informative blogs can help drive potential clients to view the site and eventually to set appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One element that you may hesitate to include on your site is a place for people to provide feedback. However, failing to do so may cause you to miss opportunities to get ranked higher in search results and make improvements to the practice. Discover how asking for feedback can take management at your practice to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of an open comment section&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews and opinions have become essential resources people consider when viewing a new practice or product. If a company does not ask for feedback, prospective clients may look elsewhere. When devising a site design, the placement of feedback can vary. A link at the footer of each page is one option. Popup feedback prompts at various spots on the site is another way to collect this data. Gathering feedback demonstrates that your practice welcomes opinions, and it gives you the chance to improve the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ways to utilize feedback for the better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you interact with people on your site, the higher the page may rank in search results. This is in part due to the way search engines calculate the trustworthiness of a website. When engines like Google find a site trustworthy, it bumps it up higher in the ranks. This, in turn, helps &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/&quot;&gt;market your practice&lt;/a&gt; to a broader audience. Engaging with those who submit feedback demonstrates management&amp;#8217;s willingness to address issues and make changes. Some simple actions may help improve your business tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reexamine current processes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a client provides a negative review or expresses discontent, take a look at the current processes. When you actively work to change things after receiving negative feedback, you increase the chances of attracting new patients. For instance, improving the check-in procedure after getting complaints about it can help the flow of traffic in the office. It may also cut down on unnecessary work for employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take visible action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a manager, it is important to think carefully about what you need to do to rectify a negative experience, especially if it involves addressing an employee&amp;#8217;s actions or behavior. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/29/8-ways-negative-feedback-can-lead-to-greater-success-at-work/#5f20f2d32c69&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/29/8-ways-negative-feedback-can-lead-to-greater-success-at-work/#5f20f2d32c69&quot;&gt;Forbes.com&lt;/a&gt; points out, the more you focus on the opportunity for improvement, the better workers will handle negative feedback. Aside from taking action within the practice, you must respond to the original post. When potential clients can see that you made a timely response, it increases your authority and legitimacy. Because medical practices rely heavily on word of mouth for new patients, the faster you respond to feedback, the greater the chance people will take note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get help with your site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a successful practice takes a great deal of work. Instead of trying to fit in time to deal with building and maintaining your website, consider engaging our team at Doctor Genius to assist. Not only do we offer SEO and website building, but we can also insert crucial comment sections in places where existing and prospective patients can see them. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Call us&lt;/a&gt; so we can go over your options.&lt;/p&gt;

If you are like many business owners, you<a class="moretag" href="/importance-of-building-in-feedback/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-building-in-feedback/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-building-in-feedback/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 19:00:05 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To enable comments or not to enable comments, that is the question. If you are like many business owners, you fear that by adding a comment section to your blog or website, you are inadvertently inviting negative feedback. Negative feedback, especially when shared in such a public way, can adversely affect visitors’ perceptions of your practice or brand. Add to this the fact that enabling comments is time-consuming, as commenters often expect responses, and that it requires moderation to deter junk commenters, you may feel that the answer is obvious: Keep the comments off. However, at Doctor Genius, we encourage you to do the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasons to incorporate a comment section into your site design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing world has long been in debate over the whys and why-nots of a comments section on a blog. You can check out the for- and against- arguments on &lt;a href=&quot;https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/&quot;&gt;Optinmonster&lt;/a&gt;, but we want to share our thoughts with you below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build a network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content marketing serves three major purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To help your site gain rankings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To establish your practice as an authoritative presence&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To build relationships with current and potential patients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing feedback enables you to do the third by giving you a way to connect with your followers, to develop relationships based on mutual interests and respect, and to turn an otherwise static piece of content in a living conversation. In short, it allows you to build a network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encourage constructive criticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You create content for your audience members, so allow them to make suggestions. Turn the comments section on to encourage feedback regarding an article’s content and to invite ideas for improvement and future topics. This type of constructive criticism gives you a tangible sense of how your audience responds to your content, as well as ways you can improve it so that it resonates positively with the intended recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contribute to your SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many website owners who turn off the comments section fail to take into consideration the SEO value it offers. While a handful of comments is unlikely to make a difference for any given page’s rankings, dozens to hundreds of comments can. How? The reason is two-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, comments contribute to page length. Second, more words on a page gives it an opportunity to rank for more keywords. To determine whether this contributed to increased search traffic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/&quot;&gt;Neil Patel&lt;/a&gt; conducted an in-depth study. He found two things to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was that, on a comments section that added nearly 4,000 words to a page, approximately 26% of keywords that ranked in Google came from the comments section. The second was that the section garnered approximately 16% of the article’s traffic. Though incorporating feedback into your site design may make more work for you, the results can be well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The smart way to enable comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A section that encourages feedback can help in multiple other ways, such as keeping your &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/&quot;&gt;site live&lt;/a&gt;, encouraging customer loyalty, and serving as social proof. Of course, there are the drawbacks to consider, but those become a moot point when you have a dedicated account manager moderating comments, responding to feedback, and, of course, dealing with the back-end issues. To partner with such an account manager, call Doctor Genius at &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;1-877-477-2311&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

Focus on this has created an entire marketing industry that revolves around &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/&quot;&gt;search engine optimization&lt;/a&gt; and tools to increase a site’s chances of being viewed. One strategy that many have not heard of focuses on semantic similarity and semantic distance to promote content based on the words themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Natural language processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b&quot;&gt;Natural language processing&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that search engines use to help find content that matches a specific search. An AI identifies certain words in a section of text that it deems particularly important — more important than the rest of the text. These words are often nouns or pronouns, like names, businesses, numbers, and locations, and the AI picks them out to determine how a webpage should rank with related search terms. A good content writer can take these words and integrate them as relevant SEO keywords, producing a higher rank overall for a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scoring term frequency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every document, those specific words, called entities, can be matched with certain search words. However, not all-important terms in a document identically match someone’s search. The AI&amp;#8217;s score is based on how often a word or term appears in the text. The more it appears, the higher it is ranked in terms of importance. However, if the same word or phrase appears across many texts online, its ranking may get lowered because its popularity indicates it is simply a general term (and is therefore not as important). Balancing these two factors is key in getting the most out of your document terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scoring semantic similarity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Semantic&amp;#8221; refers to the meaning of words. When ranking similarities between words, natural language processing considers how two words may fall in the same category when compared to words that do not relate to them at all. This process can be helpful for finding websites that are relevant but may not contain the exact words in a user&amp;#8217;s search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reducing semantic distance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantic distance is how far apart two words appear in natural language processing. By using words that relate to each other and so fall into the same categories, a writer can produce content that is more likely to be picked up by search engines looking for similar words. That said, beyond simply identifying content topics, with semantic similarity there is a greater chance of sites being organized and ranked based on content. This can make the rankings more convoluted, which is why including words that are similar to search terms can rank your site higher in regard to both organization and topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Find more ways to reduce semantic distance in your content&lt;/h2&gt;

Search engine giants like Google have started using<a class="moretag" href="/how-to-view-your-salience-score/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-view-your-salience-score/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-view-your-salience-score/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 19:00:10 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Entity salience is beginning to come to the forefront of website architecture. Search engine giants like Google have started using a salience score to analyze and prioritize search results. To understand how entity salience can help your website perform better in the result rankings and improve search engine optimization, you first have to learn what an entity is and how salience applies to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding natural language processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and other sites use natural language processing to determine the overall meaning of text content on a webpage. This function is carried out by an artificial intelligence program to identify what a real human would find important in a block of text. You can improve content management by focusing on entity salience, though it is important to note that entity salience is not the same thing &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/&quot;&gt;as SEO keywords&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Entities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entity is usually a specific word in a text that references a noun. For example, a person, a business, a product, and even a number may be recognized as entities within a body of text. A natural language processing AI can identify entities even when they are not specifically named, like when a named person is mentioned again in nominal form. The identification of these entities is the first step toward building a salience score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Salience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When referred to an entity, salience means exactly what its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt; definition is: being especially noticeable or conspicuous. In text, entities that are salient are those words that the AI detects as being important or prominent to a real person. This does not necessarily mean that someone who reads a website’s content will pick up on all those words. The AI simply uses its estimation of salient entities to create a score of readability and SEO popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The salience score&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several factors contribute to how these entities are identified through natural language processing. From a single block of text, an entity may be chosen because of its location in the text, its grammar, if it is linked to sections of the sentence, and how much it stands out. Again, names, nouns, and pronouns all get bonus points in the process. The distinction between entities and keywords is incredibly important to content writers, as a writer can work to incorporate an entity and keyword closely together so that they both rank higher together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calculating your salience score&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since salience scores are not yet fully popularized and it is not clear how much they may improve website SEO, finding a website to calculate your score can be difficult. Lexalytics and the Google Natural Language API Demo are both options where you can type in text and see how it ranks. By experimenting with different types of texts, you can discover what entities get identified the most and how to write content around salience and SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn more about salience scores for your website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a lot that needs to be explored with entity salience.

While we at Doctor Genius like to think of ourselves as a team of forward-thinking individuals, we tend to agree. It is true that negative word-of-mouth marketing can have a damaging effect on customers’ perceptions of a brand and, therefore, the brand’s profits, but the truth is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/&quot;&gt;negative W-O-M is what you make of it&lt;/a&gt;.

While the brand fully expected some pushback, it was surprised by who was doing the pushback and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the company’s reports, the most verbal (read: outraged) customers were those who the brand perceived to be their most valuable. These individuals were, on average, 70% more engaged with the rewards program than those who remained silent. The company realized that the negative comments stemmed from customers’ emotional connection to the brand that, prior to the program changes, was a positive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to use negative W-O-M to your advantage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of who is posting negative comments about your practice, you can learn from LoyaltyOne’s response to the 2011 situation. In addition to monitoring customers’ responses throughout the entire commentary period, the brand also publicly clarified any inaccuracies and responded to specific questions. Its participation in the conversation offset the bad experience with a new, positive one. It also reinforced the brand’s core values that attracted the most engaged members in the first place. The overall result was that approximately one-third of outraged commenters ended up redeeming their points afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1800Flowers is another major company from which you can learn, but unlike with LoyaltyOne, its experience teaches you what not to do. On February 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2015, many 1-800-Flowers customers received wilted flower arrangements and half-crushed chocolates. Though the company has a long-standing reputation for delivering outstanding products, this single bad experience stuck with customers for months. Though it did issue a public statement apologizing for the incident, Spiegel Research Center suggests &lt;a href=&quot;https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/news/1800flowersfail---negative-word-of-mouth-matters.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/news/1800flowersfail---negative-word-of-mouth-matters.html&quot;&gt;three other steps&lt;/a&gt; it should have taken — and that you should consider if you fall victim to negative online marketing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an opportunity for NWOM posters to re-experience your brand. &lt;/strong&gt;Do not just issue a refund or apology. Provide the product or service again, but for free.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach out to NWOM posters individually.&lt;/strong&gt; So that those directly affected by your actions know that your apology is sincere and that you genuinely care about their opinions, reach out to them individually. Show that you are willing to listen, learn, and change.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use negative W-O-M&lt;/strong&gt; as an opportunity to participate in customer discussions and show followers that you take any complaints about your brand seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take control of your online reputation&lt;/h2&gt;

Until recently, many thought the on-demand economy would be a passing trend, directed toward the young and wealthy. However, recent data shows that is far from the case, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy&quot;&gt;30% of on-demand consumers&lt;/a&gt; being between the ages of 35 and 54, and another 22% age 55 and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to be expected, the largest sector of the on-demand economy is online marketplaces. This is followed by transportation, with food and grocery coming in third. As a health care practitioner, you may assume you are not a part of this, but you would be wrong. On-demand health and beauty services account for $8.1 billion in consumer spending each year, and analysts anticipate spending will only grow with time. It is important that you adapt your content marketing strategy to accommodate this change and appeal to the on-demand market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The power of listicles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a strong content marketing strategy utilizes a variety of content types, consumers respond particularly well to lists and bullet points. The most popular women’s magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and Good Housekeeping have included listicles for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listicles appeal to consumers’ need to lump things into round-numbered groups, a tendency that marketing scholars Robert M. Schindler and Mathew S. Isaac refer to as the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1&quot;&gt;top 10 effect&lt;/a&gt;.” According to the scholars, by lumping items into rounded numbered groups, such as “Top 10,” or “20 Best,” it becomes easier for consumers to process mass amounts of information quickly. Not only that, but it also helps them to make what they deem “more informed decisions” quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when a list details the “Top 10 On-Demand Health Care Services,” the 10 items within the list get particular notice. Consumers tend to consider other services that do not make the cut as “inferior.” This is true even of services that come in at number 11, even if the cause of that ranking is minimal or unknown. The impression most people get when viewing such a list is that if an item does not rank in the top 10, it is a level down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means for your practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Digital Journal, 30% of blog posts are lists, suggesting that you cannot go wrong with this format. In addition to aspiring to be a part of a Top 10 list by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/&quot;&gt;leveraging technology&lt;/a&gt;, you should create lists of your own. At Doctor Genius, listicles are one of our go-to content formats for driving engagement and guiding readers through the sales cycle. On behalf of our clients, we create lists on everything from the top dental restoration procedures to ways patients can improve heart health to the benefits of clear braces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leverage listicles to boost your rankings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we are familiar with the most effective strategies for marketing health care and dental practices online. While we believe in the power of listicles, we also know that a tailored approach is key to driving user engagement and truly connecting with current and potential patients.

Among those challenges is your ability to incite trust in prospective patients, demonstrate competency of care, and encourage prospects to choose you over your competitors — all before they ever set foot in your office. While an up-to-date website, strong content, and patient reviews can go a long way toward helping you overcome several marketing challenges, original photos and detailed imagery may be just what you need to overcome the unique three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A picture is worth a thousand words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can invest all your resources into beautiful web design, informative content, and strategic SEO, but without supplementing your efforts with high-quality imagery, your efforts may be for naught. According to Solve, websites that feature “good images” receive &lt;a href=&quot;https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.&quot;&gt;94% more views&lt;/a&gt; than those without photos or with low-quality images. Moreover, substandard photos may hurt your practice more than a lack of photos, as low-grade pictures send the impression that your brand is cheap, impersonal, and untrustworthy. The right photos, however, can do the opposite and help your practice overcome challenges one, two, and three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build trust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original photography is one of the best ways to build trust in prospective patients. Real images give prospects a glimpse of who you are as a provider and what type of community you have created in-office. Genuine smiles on the faces of real patients and team members help prospects feel reassured that you operate a warm, welcome, and caring environment and that people are happy to be in your care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, before and after photos of real patients let you live up to the adage of “show, don’t tell.” It is easy enough to state on your website that you specialize in full-mouth restorations, but convincing patients that this is true requires proof. An image gallery with clearly labeled before and after photos can serve as all the evidence you need, though it cannot hurt to accompany images with patient testimonials as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Demonstrate competency of care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust and competency go hand in hand. If a prospect does not trust that you can competently manage his or her care, he or she will not choose you despite your other redeeming qualities. Use imagery to provide a comprehensive and visual overview of your services, procedures, and outcomes, such as what we did with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/&quot;&gt;new Doctor Genius video&lt;/a&gt;. If you use high-tech equipment in your practice, go beyond original photos and use videos to demonstrate how it works. Do not be afraid to play with photos and video to guide prospects through the patient journey so they know what to expect. Finally, use imagery to educate patients on your services, address common health issues, and provide tips for how patients can protect their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Differentiate your brand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, original photos are an effective way to set yourself apart from the competition. Whereas many brands still rely on stock imagery, whether because of time, cost, or unawareness, you can set your brand apart by offering a wholly transparent and honest look at your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attract more patients with tailored solutions&lt;/h2&gt;

So long as providers could fulfill potential patients’ needs on those two factors alone, there was little reason for them to differentiate themselves from the competition. Today, however, that is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web design strategies to set your practice apart from the competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, if health care providers wish to attract new patients and keep existing ones, they must set themselves apart from the competition. While a big portion of the patient experience takes place in office, it really begins online. These digital marketing strategies can help your site stand out from the rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Play with format&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some types of content prove more effective than others in terms of engagement and rankings, but at Doctor Genius, we know from experience that no single type of content will appeal to every visitor. It makes sense to vary your content from time to time, even if doing so goes against the status quo for your industry. As a health care provider, you likely use long-form articles, short blog posts, original research, and case studies as the foundation of your strategy. However, you can expand your reach and grow your audience by incorporating one or more of the following formats as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Infographics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quizzes and polls&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Podcasts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Webinars&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Email newsletters&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Video&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Health checklists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fill the gaps in competitors’ messaging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To differentiate yourself from the competition, Forbes suggests &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3&quot;&gt;stalking your competitors online&lt;/a&gt;. Visit their websites, follow their blogs, like their Facebook pages, sign up for their email newsletters, and listen to their podcasts. Make note of the topics they routinely discuss and identify gaps. By either expanding on tired topics or broaching new ones, you can position yourself as an industry thought leader, an invaluable position to hold in the health or dental field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Offer virtual tours&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health care industry has the unique challenge of helping potential patients overcome their phobias before they even schedule an appointment. One effective way to do this is through &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.&quot;&gt;virtual tours&lt;/a&gt;. These allow potential patients to get to know every facet of your practice and to familiarize themselves with the environment before they set foot in your office. They also let you showcase special amenities you may have, such as X-ray machines, special kids’ activity areas, and recovery rooms. Live tours, especially those that contain voiceover narration, can give website visitors much-needed reassurance that you prioritize their comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use real photos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual elements are such an important part of any website, but not all imagery is created equal. According to findings from a Marketing Experiments study, prospective customers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested&quot;&gt;35% more likely to convert&lt;/a&gt; when presented with real imagery as opposed to stock photos. While there are several reasons behind this, the takeaway is simple: Always use real photos when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

This increases the chances that more people will read your post, which in turn increases the chances of gaining new patients. At Doctor Genius, we can help improve your content management to attract more clients. Along with using the right keywords, it is also important to understand what a salience score refers to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding salience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salience refers to the importance of a language feature within a text. In other words, the language that the writer uses in the web copy helps a search engine understand the true nature of the website. Machine learning technology helps to predict which words or concepts are deemed more important by those reading the text, and writers should strive to incorporate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, writing content is about more than just getting leads. The content must be helpful and of high quality, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-speaking-to-a-general-audience/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-speaking-to-a-general-audience/&quot;&gt;tailoring the information&lt;/a&gt; is important.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to improve the salience score&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salience score is what language processors assign to language and words in web copy. The higher the score, the more important it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use entities in the copy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve the salience score and, ultimately, search ranking, Inc.com talks about how you must &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/david-amerland/a-smart-trick-to-help-your-business-rank-in-google-searches.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/david-amerland/a-smart-trick-to-help-your-business-rank-in-google-searches.html&quot;&gt;include entities&lt;/a&gt; in one way or another. Doing this causes a search engine, such as Google for example, to calculate the text differently. It may be challenging knowing what words to use, but Google does have an Application Programming Interface that writers can use to see what score the copy would be assigned. Just insert your text into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/&quot;&gt;API demo&lt;/a&gt; to see if you should make any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Position text properly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers tend to place more importance on the beginning of a sentence. To improve your salience score, make sure the topic’s focus is at the start. This may take grammatical tricks to change word order to place emphasis on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Increase the number of references to the entity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be able to improve your score if you make more references to the entity. If possible, use different terms that refer to the same recognizable entity. Do this naturally, and skip it if it seems forced, as if you mention the entity too much, it can hurt the score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make the entity the focus in complex sentences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search engines like Google are able to perform complex functions that identify linguistic relationships in longer sentences. Language processors can understand the relationships between the subject, object, and verb, and if the entity remains the main focus, the score is higher.&lt;/p&gt;

However, dentists and medical professionals as a whole, need more than simple facts stated on a page. Starting out as a content writer, I strove to find the balance between providing well-researched academic information and speaking to a general audience. Writing for Doctor Genius has only improved my competence in authoring technical and patient-friendly medical content. In turn, my work and time with Doctor Genius have also enhanced our internal writing standards as I have become well-versed in what constitutes industry-best practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;The three main areas I have learned to consider when writing for Doctor Genius are the sources or facts of the content itself, the SEO terminology, and creating comprehensible content in an easy-to-digest platform. My name is Nick Adams, and I am the Lead Editor at Doctor Genius, going on four years with the Company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;A Bit About Myself and the Content Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;I started as a content writer at Doctor Genius in 2016, gradually working my way up to lead editor. Starting, I was the only in-house content writer. Now, as the lead editor, I mentor other writers and oversee our final product, creating greater quality control in every piece we produce. While I now focus more on editing and writing specialized content, my goal remains the same: improving our professionalism and readability standards, translating into improved client ranking, connecting more new patients to clients. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;While the goal was the same, it was not easy to expand the styles and forms of content beyond what we had. After four years, I have been able to help the content department grow with the help of my manager, Alexander Hess. With his guidance, we continue to focus on quality over quantity while expanding our client’s ranking signals in authority and expertise through adding new digital assets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;One Step in the Overall Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Our writers’ editing process is more like a conversation, highlighting any corrections or changes to consider and sending it back to them for review. We strive to help our writers grow in their skills while also expanding their knowledge. Even after our writers complete the training, we encourage them to continue learning. When we assign a writer a custom content order, they will start researching the various keywords, the client’s medical specialty, and anything else they need to know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Even though the content department is only one part of the process, it is crucial to follow any instructions and strive for content that will help boost the client’s online presence. Once the writer finishes the content, I will review it and mark-up any changes they need to see before passing it back. After a final review, the content is ready to move on through to production for installation to the website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;After graduating from Azusa Pacific University, with a BA in English-Writing Concentration, in 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-adams-27630344/&quot;&gt;Nick Adams&lt;/a&gt; utilized his writing skills to build a professional career in writing. While at APU, Nick studied various forms and styles of writing, including journalism and technical writing. Before DG, Nick worked in other technical writing roles before shifting his focus on blogs and webpages associated with the medical field of addiction, mental health, and dual diagnosis treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;In 2016, we brought Nick on as a Content Writer. Since then, Nick has written, edited, or overseen upwards of 300 separate custom content orders, written various forms of media text (blogs, video scripts, and press releases), and conducted quality control on written content. In total, he has worked on several thousand sites and clocked-in nearly a million words. His dedication, team spirit, and exceptional talent earned him a well-deserved promotion to Lead Editor last Winter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As he describes, “writing is a passion of mine, and I intend to take that passion into my everyday work. With my skills and experience, I plan to continue guiding our content department on our growth path and ensuring our clients receive the quality content they deserve.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Quality Content Over Quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt; Creating quality content and helping oversee the creation of said content involves focusing on three main areas mentioned earlier: resources, SEO terminology, and comprehensible content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;A major component of writing and editing content involves searching for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/&quot;&gt;professional and credible resources&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does this help our writers to learn better and understand the topic, but it also helps to flesh out the web pages for patients. The overall goal is to help patients learn and understand the specific service or treatment before scheduling an appointment. We focus on using .org websites, academic sources, and other information databases with this in mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;SEO Terminology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;While the client has a list of keywords and terms relevant to their services, we strike a balance between SEO and comprehension. This way, the content is not weighed down with too many keywords to the point of being spam— this practice is often referred to as “keyword stuffing.” However, we still strive to use more technical or precise terms somewhere on a page to increase the chance of a patient searching that term online and finding our client’s website. This balance is struck by understanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-explains-the-difference-between-neural-matching-and-rankbrain/299713/&quot;&gt;neural matching&lt;/a&gt;, which is writing content that will help a search engine present content that greatly matches a searcher&amp;#8217;s intention. By working with our marketing team, we can determine the best course of action for each patient. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Comprehensible Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;As an editor, I take the necessary time to read content for more than just errors. The content needs to be understandable for patients so that they are comfortable receiving medical services and are more likely to opt for the right treatment. At the same time, we strive to ensure it is factual and informative. This translates into clearly looking through every piece of content for its ability to reach the intended audience in a way that matches their specific needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;How to Start Getting High-Quality Content Today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Although<a class="moretag" href="/how-to-write-for-neural-matching/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-write-for-neural-matching/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-write-for-neural-matching/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 19:00:11 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The future of search engine optimization strategizing changes when new search tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1201549327144898567&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1201549327144898567&quot;&gt;neural matching algorithms&lt;/a&gt; are put into play. Although search engine providers do not reveal specific algorithms to the public, the artificial intelligence tools used in programming provide a more specific search experience for users. SEO content creators must take new algorithm changes into account when mapping out &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/&quot;&gt;future strategies&lt;/a&gt; to avoid getting stuck with outdated methods and losing vital search ranking positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neural matching and SEO strategizing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern techniques in search engine content formatting benefit both service providers and search engine users by making it easier to make a connection between the two groups. When formulating a strategy for keyword optimization, SEO content creators should utilize new techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does neural matching work? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike more outdated artificial intelligence, the AI used in neural matching dives deeper into the reasoning behind searches to better analyze the user&amp;#8217;s thought process and retrieve more meaningful and relevant content. By using a more thorough AI analysis, the search engine taps into a more diverse database of content. More diverse content retrieval means the user is more likely to connect with the sought-after results instead of more superficial, though related, content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify the process, neural matching allows the search engine to better understand what the user is trying to find, resulting in more relevant content. The easiest way for these algorithms to diversify the search is to not only pull in content that has exact or closely related keywords to the user&amp;#8217;s search input but also synonyms to those keywords and the associated content. The reasoning behind pulling in this related information is to help the user reach the intended result even if the search terms were not a perfect match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does neural matching affect SEO strategies? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search engines utilizing AI that better understand the reasoning behind a user&amp;#8217;s search keywords leads to a more personalized user experience. To fall in line with a more customized search and maintain high search engine rankings, SEO content writers must adapt to the use of neural matching algorithms. Traditional SEO features strategically-placed keywords and phrases as a part of content formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key adaptation techniques is to anticipate the related keywords the algorithm pulls into searches and integrate them into the writing as well. Using this strategy helps the algorithm make more intelligent connections between keywords and their synonyms without affecting rankings. If a site&amp;#8217;s ranking does slip as search engines adjust, the effect is likely temporary and can be mitigated by using a slightly modified SEO strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn about the latest marketing strategies&lt;/h2&gt;

It helps to make it as easy as possible for potential patients to make an appointment, and we all know the simplest solution is often the right one. Here are some reasons why a good call-to-action phrase can make a difference in your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simplifying the process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the most creative websites are not going to convert clients if the clients are unsure about what the next steps are. Here are examples of how a CTA can convert potential patients by making it easier for them to buy something or make an appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It encourages obedience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From even the earliest years of life, people are used to being told what to do. This explains why a CTA in the form of a command tends to be more effective than one in the form of a question. For example, someone is more likely to click on a link or button that says &amp;#8220;Purchase now!&amp;#8221; than one that says &amp;#8220;Are you ready to purchase?&amp;#8221; Using an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smbceo.com/2018/02/16/why-ctas-are-the-most-important-thing-on-your-website/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;http://www.smbceo.com/2018/02/16/why-ctas-are-the-most-important-thing-on-your-website/&quot;&gt;authoritative command&lt;/a&gt; can be very convincing for many potential patients. Without a CTA, they can be unsure of what to do next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It promotes conversion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, a simple, direct CTA can convert a client because it does not require much thought. For example, &amp;#8220;Click here to schedule an appointment&amp;#8221; is effective because it both tells patients what to do and allows them to set an appointment without having to call the office directly. Without that CTA, clients viewing the website would have to make a decision about whether that office was the right choice for them, track down a contact number, and call to set up the appointment. Many customers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/#6936250b801b&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/#6936250b801b&quot;&gt;will not take the time&lt;/a&gt; to do that and will look elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It draws the reader&amp;#8217;s attention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a page full of black and white words, a bright red button or bold red text can effectively stand out and pull the reader&amp;#8217;s gaze where you want it to go. While viewers already interested in a product or service may take the time to search a website for how to take the next steps towards making a purchase or appointment, it can take something more extreme to convince a bored viewer to pay attention and seriously consider taking another step. A distinct CTA button as a content format feature can also be easier for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/&quot;&gt;mobile viewers&lt;/a&gt; to find. &lt;/p&gt;

A surprising amount of information about the health of the rest of the body can be revealed through the mouth. A checkup from a Complete Health dentist also involves screening for conditions such as oral cancer and periodontal disease. Although Complete Health is a dental philosophy, there are also medical practices in which general practitioners choose to perform simple procedures rather than referring patients to specialty practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also SEO advantages to expanding your practice in unexpected directions. Patients looking for the additional services you offer may be more likely to find you if they are listed on your website or mentioned in blogs or social media posts. However, while your medical marketing materials should include the services you do perform, it should also identify the services for which you will have to refer patients to other doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is it important to mention services you do not cover?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Family Physicians describes the often nostalgic view of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0900/p33.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0900/p33.html&quot;&gt;general practitioners&lt;/a&gt; in the &amp;#8220;old days&amp;#8221; performing all types of medicine. Back then, referring patients to other doctors was not practical and sometimes not even possible. In today&amp;#8217;s world, you cannot do everything related to the practice of medicine, and it is not reasonable to expect it. However, it is to your advantage, and the patients&amp;#8217; benefit, to explain what you do not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Communicating honestly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful communication between provider and patient depends on honesty. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1137&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1137&quot;&gt;survey in the Journal of Health Affairs&lt;/a&gt; revealed that a significant portion of the 1,891 respondents admitted to dishonesty in communication with patients, with 20% concealing medical errors and nearly half giving exaggeratedly positive prognoses. Explaining to your patients what you do not do upfront helps lay the foundation for honest communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Building a brand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to online information from health care websites and review apps, patients tend to be more informed before reaching the doctor&amp;#8217;s office than ever before. This can work to your advantage if you want to be known as the doctor that treats such-and-such conditions in your area. For balance, your brand marketing should include what you do not do as well as what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Managing patients&amp;#8217; expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients choose health care providers not only on the basis of medical information but on the advice of family and friends. In many cases, referrals from existing patients represent a sizable portion of new patients. Therefore, one negative experience for a patient who was confused and frustrated about the services you do and do not provide could put a significant dent in your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you communicate which areas require referrals?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to communicating honestly with patients, you should also be clear in how your relay what services need to be referred. Be sure they are delineated from the services you do provide with an unambiguously worded, eye-catching header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn effective and responsible medical marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your medical marketing should adhere to the same standards of responsibility and ethics as the rest of your practice. We devote meticulous effort to creating honest and accurate SEO materials. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Contact Doctor Genius&lt;/a&gt; for help creating a campaign worthy of your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

People are in need of quality health care that is compatible with their current insurance plan, perhaps more than ever in recent history. In addition, now is the ideal time to encourage both current and potential patients to prioritize health and wellness through routine care and the prompt diagnoses of illnesses and developing conditions. As a result, dental and medical practices may need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/&quot;&gt;adjust website content&lt;/a&gt; to bring those potential clients through the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem with incomplete insurance information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a prospective patient begins searching for a new health care provider, browsing websites is often a starting point. While there may be several factors that influence the decision to make an appointment, patients ultimately need to know that your office accepts their current insurance plan. Your site may offer stunning visuals, excellent content, and stellar reviews. However, if you are missing this key component in the patient&amp;#8217;s decision-making process, you could be losing numerous potential clients. Individuals searching for something new will likely be tempted to keep searching until they find the answers they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of adding insurance listings to your site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to bring more patients to your practice, providing a complete, up-to-date list of accepted insurance plans is a good place to start. This eliminates wasted time on both ends, preventing the patient from enduring inconvenient wait times just to get the answer to a simple &amp;#8220;yes&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221; question. At the same time, your office personnel can avoid the hassle of unnecessary phone calls and stay on task with other responsibilities. When your website provides the patient with all of the essential information up front, the need to continue the search is significantly reduced, if not eliminated altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Counting on customer loyalty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurance plans and policies you choose to accept will change from year to year based on your business&amp;#8217;s needs. Fortunately, keeping updated insurance listings on your website can help you hold onto devoted patients in spite of a potential drop in coverage. For many people, loyalty to a particular doctor, dentist, or office is far more important than loyalty to the current insurance company. When you combine an atmosphere of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bjgp.org/content/early/2020/08/10/bjgp20X712349&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://bjgp.org/content/early/2020/08/10/bjgp20X712349&quot;&gt;trust and respect&lt;/a&gt; with quality care, there is a good chance your patients will be willing to make things work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing access to this useful information, you can also enable patients to switch plans during open enrollment or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/&quot;&gt;major life change&lt;/a&gt; to join or stay with your office. In addition, those who are simply shopping for new coverage can be influenced based on the plans your office accepts, especially if it appears to be a good fit for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

Blogging has transformed from a niche hobby to an essential marketing strategy that companies successfully use to engage current consumers and draw in new traffic. However, simply creating a blog is not enough. Developing an effective and beneficial blog requires constant management, SEO tactics, new content, and adaptations to current trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key steps to increase blog credibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so much bad information only a click away, more and more consumers are searching for sites that have been proven to be trustworthy and credible. Consumers want to know that a blog is offering dependable content with fresh ideas regularly (that are, of course, entertaining and appealing to read). Here are key steps to focus on to build credibility and reach more viewers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post regularly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging regularly is a must if you want to stay in your industry’s top contenders. Consumers constantly crave new content, and generating professional, helpful blog posts on a regularly maintained schedule is one of the easiest ways to develop a trusting relationship with them. The more reliable content a blog produces, the faster it will build an audience — a crucial step for many businesses trying to get off the ground. Many consumers have a sharp eye for a live site, and it is usually obvious when a site has not been updated recently, which can bring reliability into question. Posting regularly also helps build a site’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-eat-misconceptions/333875/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-eat-misconceptions/333875/&quot;&gt;E-A-T&lt;/a&gt;, or Expertise, Authority, and Trust, which is a tool Google uses to identify and promote proven trustworthy blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use hyperlinks and backlinks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperlinks create a hidden web of connectivity within the blogging world. By hyperlinking information in one post to another creator’s content, you are building connections with that creator. Hyperlinking can also develop your site’s credibility, so long as you are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/&quot;&gt;reliable sources&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, backlinks are also beneficial in connecting other sites to your own, and they can help your site perform better in search engine results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Include keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, search engine optimization is a practice that broadens a site’s audience by bringing new consumers to it naturally through a search engine. When a consumer types certain keywords into Google, the top results contain those words. This is why incorporating keywords into each post is crucial. Your post, and therefore your website, is more likely to be discovered if it includes occasional keywords that might get entered into a search engine. Using them in the content, taglines, and tags of a post will make it easier for consumers to find.&lt;/p&gt;

Relying on the same generic pictures that everyone else in your industry is using can reflect poorly on your company. By focusing on appealing to more users with unique, eye-catching photos, you have a better chance at ranking higher on search engines and improving your overall SEO. Learn how to take your digital marketing efforts a step further by including pictures of your office on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knowing when to use stock or original photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While using unique imagery throughout your company website would be ideal for most effectively branding your company, it is not always practical to include an original photograph every time you need an image on a page. If you&amp;#8217;re using a mix of stock and personal photos on your site, it is important you know when it is acceptable to use stock photos and when you should use a photographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When to use stock photos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock photos can easily be found online and may be free or sold for a low price, depending on the site you use. Some of these photos are very high-quality, effective photographs and can be used for your ads and campaigns in situations where you need to save money and get the image out right away. While these photos may be professional quality, most people can tell the image came from a stock image site, so use these sparingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When to use original photos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original photos are images that you produce in-house by either taking your own pictures or hiring a professional photographer. Using your own pictures is most essential when you are trying to create a personal connection with your patients and show them the faces behind your company. By including pictures of staff members and using real photos of your office throughout the website, your potential patients get to know you better and are more likely to choose to use your services with you as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making your images SEO friendly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is almost always better to use your own images on your site, you still need to pay attention to how they are being used to have the best ranking. For the best SEO results, keep the following tips in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use images on every page, including with every blog post&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Place images near the text it applies to&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Give the photo a unique name that matches the subject matter&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reduce the file size by compressing it without compromising quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consider the format of the photo and how you plan to use it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensure your images are compatible with mobile devices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Resize the image to the appropriate size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make the biggest impact on future patients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients choose medical providers they can trust, which is why using original photos that let your patients get to know you better is so beneficial. Learn how you can work with us at Doctor Genius to make the biggest impact possible on your patients and show them that they are in good hands.

While neural matching has not replaced the previous algorithms used to generate Google search results, it does play a role in how the latest Google core update ranks webpages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neural matching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has always been somewhat secretive about how its search algorithms work. Additionally, the company does not use every algorithm it has developed and does not usually disclose which algorithms are in use at any one time. The reasoning is that if Google revealed exactly how the algorithms work, it would be easy for users to exploit them to artificially boost their pages to the top of the search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What neural matching is&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural matching is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/&quot;&gt;most recent update&lt;/a&gt; to Google&amp;#8217;s search algorithm. It utilizes artificial intelligence to make search results more diverse. The use of AI technology makes it easier for the Google search engine to analyze language and interpret the intent of search queries. This allows Google to match a webpage to a query based solely on the text of the webpage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way the neural matching algorithm is expected to improve the search engine&amp;#8217;s ability to interpret queries is by making it better at recognizing when people search for a term that means the same thing as a keyword on a webpage. It is estimated that this algorithm will affect about 30% of user queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/&quot;&gt;research paper released by Google&lt;/a&gt;, the algorithm may use document relevance ranking to determine the best search results while avoiding spam and irrelevant results. In other words, this algorithm could help the search engine figure out which results are the best and rank those the highest while pushing pages that try to game the system or have little relevance to the query lower in the rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How neural matching affects search engine optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core concept of neural matching is to reward content creators for effectively answering the questions posed by users in queries and de-emphasize the role of links and keywords. However, this does not mean that Google has completely abandoned the traditional ranking criteria used by the core algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, it is believed that the traditional criteria are applied first to thin the herd by removing spam and irrelevant pages from the results. Then, the new algorithm is used to re-rank the remaining results, so that the most useful results receive the top rankings. Doctor Genius can help content creators improve page rankings by creating content that is useful to users while also establishing the basic credibility and relevance of the content by attracting high-quality backlinks and including relevant keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optimize your SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of neural matching has not radically changed how Google rankings work. However, it could impact how your pages rank. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Contact Doctor Genius today&lt;/a&gt; to find out how we can help you optimize your pages to make the most of this new neural matching algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;

Utilizing keywords does nothing if readers do not read your posts. You want high conversion numbers, and shorter attention spans may put even the most SEO-optimized site at risk. Learn how to create articles that readers can quickly skim to glean the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How ranking and content work together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google uses algorithms to increase a page&amp;#8217;s visibility during a search return. The higher your site ranks, the more likely a potential client is to click on your page. However, getting clicks is just the beginning. Your content format must also engage and appeal to your practice&amp;#8217;s target audience. Your blog posts should be easy to read, focusing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/&quot;&gt;topics and information relevant&lt;/a&gt; to your practice. When we at DG create content, we focus on making them topical and easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing blogs for your target audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/&quot;&gt;Time magazine&lt;/a&gt;, the average person gives an article approximately 15 seconds before abandoning it. You have to hook potential clients in that short time. Utilizing methods designed to provide them with information in easy-to-digest chunks can help. Employing several methods in posts to increase reader engagement may translate into more appointments for your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Headings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good strategy to help appeal to a skimmer is utilizing headings. As in this article, paragraph headers break up content by topics. While this alone may not be enough to convey your message to readers, it can direct the eyes to the portions of your content that appeal directly to them. For instance, if your interest lies in creating lists, you may jump to the heading entitled &amp;#8220;Bullet Points&amp;#8221; in this article. Headings direct readers to the information they seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bullet points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way to further maximize skimming, integrate bullet points and lists into your posts. There are a variety of ways you can do this effectively. Try not to overuse this method as your content will wind up looking like a to-do list rather than an informative and engaging post. Some elements that lend themselves easily to bullet lists include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Symptoms and signs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Frequently prescribed medications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Common diagnoses&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Treatment options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When readers start by reading lists, it may catch their attention and prompt them to finish the article for more insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visual aids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People may gravitate to posts that contain visual content other than words. Integrating photographs, graphs, and charts into your content may capture potential clients by giving them something colorful to ponder. Visual representations of medical conditions, such as cavities, may also help readers understand what they need to watch for in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get help hooking clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your practice hinges on new patients, and grabbing their attention requires content that is easily digestible and informative. Here at Doctor Genius, we pride ourselves on creating thought-provoking posts to entice readers into making an appointment.&lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt; Set up a time to speak with us&lt;/a&gt;.

It&amp;#8217;s almost certain that every practice and every team is experiencing new daily or weekly challenges. Throughout these trying times, we&amp;#8217;ve been doing everything we can to make our doctor&amp;#8217;s lives more manageable. That&amp;#8217;s why we&amp;#8217;re proud to discuss our new course of action that helps dentists turn things back around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an organization, Doctor Genius continually audits, manages, and adjusts our online strategy to what&amp;#8217;s applicable to the times. With so much uncertainty, it&amp;#8217;s important to identify new areas of opportunity and, more importantly, understand where the future of dentistry is headed. Ask yourself, before the pandemic, how prevalent were telehealth services in our industry? Fast forward today, and nearly all practice owners are adopting new innovative ways to reach patients and provide quality care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, our Doctor Genius Recovery Expert, Shawn Stiffler, has the facts and information on the preventive actions you can take to sustain your practice. With a background in finance, Shawn&amp;#8217;s expertise shines through when dealing with Dentists who don&amp;#8217;t have a 1000 ft view of their operations and don&amp;#8217;t know where to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-stiffler-68947773/&quot;&gt;Recovery Expert, Shawn Stiffler’s&lt;/a&gt; extensive experience in the industry has proven to help dentists take a deeper dive into their market to find areas of opportunity to increase overall practice revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 5 years, Shawn and Doctor Genius have been able to turn underperforming practices into thriving businesses. But how? Taking a thorough and comprehensive analysis of industry standards, industry metrics, online presence, services offered, and the overall online strategy for your business can dramatically impact the direction your business will go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, a study conducted by Local Med stated that, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 0 2%;&quot;&gt;During quarantine, hygiene appointments weren&amp;#8217;t happening. And that means those appointments weren&amp;#8217;t being reappointed either. A deep dive into Dental Intelligence&amp;#8217;s data has shown us that all across the country, hygiene chairs are less than 15% scheduled in September, October, and November.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like any other area of your business, conducting a statistical analysis of your missed appointments, no shows, and gaps in scheduling are a great place to start in order to identify ways to improve and maximize the hygiene department`s productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Did Appointments Dip in 2020?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since March, medical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/dont-avoid-your-doctor-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic&quot;&gt;visits have declined&lt;/a&gt;, despite the impact doctors warn it could have on the nation’s health. Polling indicates that people are typically more fearful of going anywhere. A few weeks ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/&quot;&gt;we looked at&lt;/a&gt; the economic impact this is having on businesses and steps professionals can take to remain successful during a financial downturn. This is why the onus is on the dentist to schedule more appointments by reaching out to patients again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2379&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scheduled Hygiene Production&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-300x212.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-768x542.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-177x125.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do we fix this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By gaining more market share! We need to fill the gaps in your schedule by creating more awareness online that your practice is accepting new patients. We need to expand your online footprint and market your practice the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental Intelligence/Local Med adds that, “Normally, hygiene schedules are 80% full. But now they&amp;#8217;re 80% empty. It&amp;#8217;s vital to take steps now in order to be on track to see as many of your hygiene patients as possible.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After auditing our own Doctor Genius client’s online and internal performance, we found that this was an overall trend for almost all dentists. It’s crucial to understand and correct this as soon as possible to ensure you’re maximizing each area of your dental practice in regard to consistency and improved performance over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We’re here to help!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since dentists are experiencing fluctuations in scheduling hygiene appointments during the quarantine, even with rescheduling efforts, there will still be a gap of incoming patients equivalent to that gap. However, clients of Doctor Genius have an online presence and system in place to continue scheduling appointments, rescheduling appointments, and focusing on patient retention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius can identify areas of opportunity to benefit a client’s practice, boost their online presence, and help increase practice sustainability during these uncertain times. With COVID-19 continuing to alter the medical landscape in numerous ways, it is crucial to have a plan that can adapt to this climate. Our team will help clients learn how to utilize their online reach to continue seeing current patients while bringing in new patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the process, Doctor Genius can help you know where you are, understand your gap analysis, and develop a plan for how to proceed. This can include a marketing plan for how to promote the key services you offer.&lt;/p&gt;

There are many ways to boost audience engagement and connect with new viewers, but not every form of content fits all business models. Understanding what type of content to create that best suits your customers can help you develop a larger audience faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content formats for optimizing your digital marketing strategy  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, there is practically no way for a business that wants to succeed to avoid using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matzucker/2019/11/14/whats-in-a-digital-marketing-strategy/#29f6d7ae68b2&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matzucker/2019/11/14/whats-in-a-digital-marketing-strategy/#29f6d7ae68b2&quot;&gt;digital marketing strategy&lt;/a&gt;. Too many consumers are online and engaged in social media not to take advantage of it, but failing to know where your audience lies in the massive online community can waste any strategy, no matter how good it may seem on paper. Determining the right content format for your business is the first step in reaching the right audience. Here are some popular and useful options to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blog posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When brainstorming ideas for your next marketing promotion, blog posts have more than likely made the list. Blogs are popular for many good reasons, as they can be incredibly successful in conveying important information to a variety of readers. There are endless types of posts that can be used to your advantage, like guides, lists, reviews, and how-to articles. However, a blog post has its limitations, and other forms of content may connect better with your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question why video platforms, such as YouTube, have remained successful for so many years. People of all ages watch videos for both entertainment and learning purposes. Videos are one of the easiest ways for viewers to absorb new content, which makes them an excellent resource for businesses looking to expand marketing. From ads to tutorials, you can use a video to address your audience about almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research that a business does itself and reports is more likely to get shared and viewed than research you report from someone else. Getting shares can skyrocket search engine optimization via backlinks and by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/&quot;&gt;establishing greater credibility&lt;/a&gt;. Conducting a survey can not only help your own business grow but may be of great interest to others in your niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infographics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infographics combine pictures and words to generate engaging content that gets to the point quickly. They are easy to follow, visually appealing, and loaded with helpful information that a reader can easily digest. The amount of time viewers spend looking at a single piece of content continues to decrease, so crafting content that gets the main points across without hassle is ideal in today’s fast-paced media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Explore more content forms for marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are only a handful of possible content formats to consider for your business. Discussing your specific clientele needs directly with a professional can help narrow down a successful marketing strategy. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; for more information on content formats and to get help planning your next promotional campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

For many patients,<a class="moretag" href="/posting-blogs-on-open-enrollment/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-on-open-enrollment/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-on-open-enrollment/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:00:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we understand that insurance plays a vital role in patients getting needed healthcare services. For many patients, financial difficulties limit what care is available, and having a reliable insurance policy can help overcome this barrier. As a physician or other healthcare provider it is necessary that you inform patients about open enrollment periods and help them find policies that work well for each unique situation. This medical marketing strategy ensures that your patients are able to continue using your practice for essential health needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAQs about open enrollment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many doctors tend to stay away from any discussion about insurance with patients. However, it is important that you inform patients when open enrollment is available so that you can be an advocate for your patients getting the care they deserve. When patients are not concerned about financial barriers to care, your practice will see more appointments made and procedures accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is open enrollment?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a narrow window of time that insurance companies allow patients to sign up for policies. It often only happens once a year, so it is important that patients do not miss the opportunity. Sometimes insurance companies host an enrollment day at the patient&amp;#8217;s job if the company has a group health plan. Other times, though, the patient may be required to contact the insurance company individually. For patients turning 65, assistance with signing up for a Medicare policy can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why is it an important marketing strategy? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish a credible, trusting relationship with your patients, you must be able to guide them through every part of receiving healthcare. Insurance coverage is one thing that many patients struggle with. By informing your patients of available insurance options and making sure that they sign up on time, you are securing that patient in your practice for the coming year. You do not want to lose an established patient simply because they forgot to sign back up on an insurance plan and can no longer afford your services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How can a practice get the word out to patients?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to reminding patients at every appointment when insurance enrollment will begin, having a practice blog can greatly benefit you. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY&quot;&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 80% of internet users have looked up some type of health information online. We are living in a connected society, and it is important that you have a place for your patients to read credible health information. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/&quot;&gt;Your blog&lt;/a&gt; can also be a great outlet for reminding patients of things like open enrollment, and updating it often helps your patients feel more connected to your practice at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore, a practice that invests in marketing spending has a much higher chance of surpassing their competitors. Here are some important ways it can help your practice thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building a brand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand differentiation, or distinguishing yourself from the rest, may seem more the purview of high-end fashion companies. Still, it is one of the most essential goals marketing spending can achieve. Which dentist is a consumer going to choose, the one who has a stellar reputation or the one who is just a “normal dentist”? Of course, there is no substitute for quality work, but marketing spending can amplify the service you provide and help your practice grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand building in a consumer-savvy market may be difficult, but consider that one of your greatest assets are your people. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup survey&lt;/a&gt; of more than 1,600 customers in three different service categories, researchers found that one of the biggest determining factors that affected a consumer’s decision to stay loyal to a brand was their interactions with customer-facing employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your practice, you and your employees are the ones who are fulfilling the promise that your brand makes. If consumers have a positive experience with you that reinforces that branding in your advertising, they will be more likely to come back and recommend the practice to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another creative way to build a brand is through &lt;a title=&quot;Backlink&quot; href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing&quot;&gt;content marketing&lt;/a&gt;. Many consumers are tired of being bombarded by ads trying to sell them something, but content marketing allows your practice to present helpful information to a potential customer through a blog or video. This way the customer connects the helpful content to you and your practice and will be more likely to think of you when they need services. It also provides the opportunity for you to build an original brand through your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effective advertising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the digital age, there are myriad avenues of advertisement. No longer can practices only advertise on television or radio; they must also consider the various advertising opportunities on the internet. Whether social media, search engine, or pay-per-click advertising, the right choice is determined by your practice and your competition. Either way, it is strongly recommended that part of your marketing budget be dedicated to digital advertising even when marketing during recessions. More specific examples of digital advertising are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Facebook ads&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Google search ads&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Search engine optimization &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Geo-targeted ads&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Social media posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which type of ad is most effective depends on the practice, but it is a good idea to consider using a mix of ads rather than spending all your resources on one platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let us help you organize your marketing spending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each practice has different marketing needs. Whether you are considering marketing spending for the first time, are building a brand, or need advice about how to prioritize and use your budget most efficiently, we can help. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Call us&lt;/a&gt; to learn more and have your questions answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb&quot;&gt;Forbes.com&lt;/a&gt;, blog posts help establish a connection between readers and your practice. When your content is well written and provides accurate information in a relatable way, readers will respond. Creating informative posts bridges the gap between potential customers and your practice. Adding posts regularly builds your presence in the Google metrics and boosts your live site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Successful blogs contain these elements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At DG, we know what it takes to boost your blog. By utilizing SEO-friendly techniques, our content develops an authoritative voice to elevate your practice in search results. Google uses the E-A-T system (Expertise, Authority, and Trust) to rank the trustworthiness of a brand or website. The more blogs that utilize certain measures, the higher the hits in this search metric. Delve into how these elements may yield new patients for your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every blog post should contain factual information. Citing outside sources via backlinks is one way to ensure the reader knows the claims made are accurate. Having verifiable sources that support the content in your blog is crucial to building the trust required to elevate your blog and business. If you are successful in establishing your authority, you may find other websites that link to your posts. When another webpage does this, it increases the visibility of your own through backlinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEO writing revolves around using keywords that search engines pick up when users enter them in the search box. Using keywords effectively in blog posts increases the likelihood of a company&amp;#8217;s page showing up in results. Knowing the appropriate keywords to utilize when optimizing hits is an integral part of digital marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Internal linking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating new material, you have the opportunity to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/&quot;&gt;promote older posts&lt;/a&gt;. Blogs remain intact on the practice&amp;#8217;s page until deleted. If there is a shortage of ideas for new material, refresh older posts. Since the medical community is continually changing, you may update a previous post with new science. Instead of deleting the previous post, link it to the new. This is another effective way to increase views and trust for your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The time to capture business is now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting new patients should no longer depend only on referrals. Take control of your marketing through the creation of regular blog posts.

The thrill that comes with the prospect<a class="moretag" href="/how-to-have-a-live-site/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 19:00:30 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For many business owners, building a website is an exciting yet stressful endeavor. The thrill that comes with the prospect of expanding one’s reach and attracting new patients or clients is shadowed by the pressure to get everything, from the design to the navigation to the content, just right. If you can relate to this, you may be tempted to sit back, relax, and watch your site do its work once you hit “Publish.” We recommend against doing this, as your website will not work for you — at least not very well — without some tender loving care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to increase the effectiveness of your website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maximize the effectiveness of your website, you need to keep it active. A live site is one that is continually updated, maintained, and refined. To keep your website from decaying, create a live site checklist. Below are four items to add to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Refresh your content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content drives traffic to your website and engages visitors. However, if it is not written for your audience, contains errors, or lacks the appropriate keywords, you risk driving visitors away: if you attract them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you launch your site, wait a couple of days and then go back to review your content with a fresh eye. Overtime, tweak it so that it is in line with your brand’s voice and speaks directly to your target market. Optimize it for search, correct any errors, and take out or edit any information that is inaccurate or no longer relevant. Go through &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/&quot;&gt;old blogs&lt;/a&gt; that were successful, looking for what worked and what didn&amp;#8217;t work on ranking reports. At this point, you can decide if your keywords need to be refreshed, so that future blogs are relevant or if you should elaborate on what worked well. For webpages, after enough time has elapsed, you may need to redo the page altogether. By auditing your content regularly, you can ensure it stays fresh and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Add new content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google prioritizes new, pertinent content over the stale, out-of-date subject matter. This is evident by its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/freshness-update/#close&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/freshness-update/#close&quot;&gt;2016 “Freshness” algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, which places a greater emphasis on the recentness of content than it ever has before. Not only does Google appreciate new content, but so, too, does your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New content in the form of blogs, landing pages, videos, infographics, white papers, and the like helps you to increase audience retention, establish trust, build authority, and, ultimately, encourage conversions. For these reasons, and for ranking purposes, one of the first things you should do after launching your website is to build a content marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Update your imagery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people return to your site, it is because they like what they saw before and want to see what new and exciting things you have to offer. Changes, no matter how slight (such as a new banner or an updated team picture), can appease return visitors and entice them to visit again soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New imagery can also give your rankings a boost. By using alt text, captions, image sitemaps, and image structured data, you can make your imagery searchable, ensuring that each page of content pulls double duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Check usability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several factors affect usability, including site speed, navigation, security and mobility. Perform a complete audit of your site across multiple different devices and platforms to ensure it performs optimally on each. If you discover any shortcomings or errors, such as 404s or slow load time, fix them to ensure a smooth user experience.   &lt;/p&gt;

While<a class="moretag" href="/qualifying-events-for-patients-marriage/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/qualifying-events-for-patients-marriage/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/qualifying-events-for-patients-marriage/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 19:00:52 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People typically only have one opportunity to enroll in an employee benefit program, unless there are other qualifying events. While certain events might not be on people&amp;#8217;s radar, most know that marriage constitutes a life event. A patient getting married who is satisfied with the current benefits program can be more likely to remain enrolled. Conversely, those who are dissatisfied may see an opportunity to drop their coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Increasing employee satisfaction with benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to create a positive patient experience for clients so a life event like marriage is a reason for them to increase current coverage rather than leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Provide multiple channels for connection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, patients are reminded about yearly examinations or upcoming appointments with a flyer in their mailbox or a phone call. A reminder about an open enrollment period or life event from a benefits provider can also jog their memory. In addition to these methods, it can be helpful to send out notifications through text messages or emails. While this usually requires client consent, it can be more effective not only in getting patients to keep their appointments but also in helping them have a positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also want to consider allowing patients to make or change appointments through a portal available on the company website. This can encourage clients to take control of their health care and make scheduling their responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encourage staff interaction &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who feel supported by every staff member they come into contact with can be more likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207234/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207234/&quot;&gt;feel valued as a client&lt;/a&gt;. Each time an employee walks by patients without smiling or acknowledging them in some way, patients may feel less like a person and more like a case number. When all staff members make patient care a top priority, it can encourage not only patient loyalty but also an increased sense of urgency regarding personal health care. Clients who feel valued by health care providers can be more likely to not only be pleased with their benefits package but also to recommend remaining with their current providers to a new spouse.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Offer affordable payment plans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unrealistic to think all treatments can be offered at affordable rates. However, expecting clients to pay a premium out of pocket for treatment can result in fewer patients agreeing to certain procedures. The following are options for payment that patients often prefer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Financing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Monthly installment payments made directly to the medical practice&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reduced cost for paying the total upfront with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/paying-medical-bills-with-no-health-insurance-2385907&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/paying-medical-bills-with-no-health-insurance-2385907&quot;&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making both elective and necessary treatments more affordable can encourage patients to see health care as a more affordable option. &lt;/p&gt;

Some states offer<a class="moretag" href="/keeping-patients-when-children-move-off-of-family-plans/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/keeping-patients-when-children-move-off-of-family-plans/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/keeping-patients-when-children-move-off-of-family-plans/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 19:00:06 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Per the Affordable Care Act, insurers phase young adults off their parents’ insurance plans by their mid-20s. Some states offer more flexibility and allow adult children to remain health care dependents until they are 30. As a provider, it is important that you understand your state’s particular rules and have a backup plan in place for when a young patient, inevitably, finds him or herself without coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Age requirements for extended health care coverage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the passage of the ACA, 37 states had already adopted a policy that granted young adults the option to remain on their parents’ health plans beyond the age of 18. However, to protect those adults living in the 13 other states that have a hard cut-off age of 19, the Obama Administration included a provision within the Affordable Care Act that states a young adult can remain on a parent’s insurance plan until the age of 26. While states can continue with their existing state law requirements for extended coverage, they may not interfere with the application of the ACA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per most states’ laws, the cut-off age was 25. Several state laws mandated that individuals be full-time students, unmarried, without dependents of their own, and residents of the state to qualify for benefits. Some went so far as to say that a dependent must reside in the same home as the policyholder. The ACA merely gave young adults in these states a year-longer grace period without severely disrupting insurers’ policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the extra year grace period, the ACA made it easier for young adults to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/children-under-26/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/children-under-26/&quot;&gt;qualify for dependent coverage&lt;/a&gt;. Per the law, any person younger than the age of 26 may remain on a parent’s health insurance plan even if the following apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The dependent starts or leaves school&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The dependent gets married&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The dependent is no longer considered a dependent for tax purposes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The dependent lives in or out of the family home&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The dependent has or adopts a child&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The dependent was offered, but turned down, employer-based coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coverage stops after a person turns 26 depends on the type of plan a parent has. If a parent has a marketplace plan, the dependent may remain on the policy until the end of the year he or she turns 26. The child must use the open enrollment or special enrollment period (whichever comes first) to apply for individual coverage. If a parent has a job-based plan, the dependent’s coverage ends at the end of his or her birthday month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;States with extended coverage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several states grant young adults even more leeway by allowing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/dependent-health-coverage-state-implementation.aspx&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/dependent-health-coverage-state-implementation.aspx&quot;&gt;extended dependent coverage up until the age of 30&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, Florida allows young, unmarried individuals who do not have dependents of their own to remain on their parents’ plans until the age of 30. In Illinois, parents of dependents who are also veterans may do the same. Other states that extend dependent coverage beyond age 26 include Wisconsin (27), South Dakota (29), New York (30), Pennsylvania (30) and New Jersey (31). These states generally require an adult child to remain unmarried and dependent-free to qualify for extended coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Special enrollment periods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a health care provider, you have a responsibility to your patients to advise them on what they can do to improve their health and quality of life. Part of doing both involves ensuring patients have adequate coverage. If you learn that a patient is about to be phased off a parent’s insurance plan, encourage them to conduct research early on, as they have limited time to enroll in a new plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients whose parents have marketplace coverage have a 120-day window to apply for coverage. This special enrollment window begins 60 days before one’s 26th birthday and ends 60 days afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special enrollment period for individuals whose parents have employer-based coverage is slightly shorter. It begins 60 days before a person’s 26th birthday but ends only 30 days after the big day. Individuals who miss the special enrollment period must wait for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/individual-and-family/2020-obamacare-open-enrollment-dates-by-state/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/individual-and-family/2020-obamacare-open-enrollment-dates-by-state/&quot;&gt;open enrollment&lt;/a&gt;, which begins November 1st and ends December 15th. (California’s open enrollment period is slightly longer, beginning on October 15th and ending January 31st.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coverage options beyond 26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are partial to their doctors or dentists and will do what is necessary to remain a patient. However, because cost is almost always a factor, you may lose a young patient who cannot afford your services to a cheaper competitor or clinic. You can take steps to prevent this from happening by informing patients of affordable coverage alternatives. Some options to discuss with young adults are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shop through the exchange&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health care exchange is a young person’s best bet for finding affordable coverage. Advise patients that if their income is between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line, they may qualify for tax credits to help subsidize the cost of health care coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Find coverage through school or an employer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many universities offer affordable coverage to students. If a patient is not a student, encourage him or her to ask about job-based coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apply for Medicaid or CHIP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicaid is low- to no-cost health insurance available to individuals whose incomes fall below 138% of the federal poverty line. CHIP is a low-cost option for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Look into COBRA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COBRA allows a young adult to stay on their parent&amp;#8217;s plan for up to 18 months after their 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. However, the policyholders must assume the cost of coverage, which can get expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Check out catastrophic plans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/catastrophic-insurance&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/catastrophic-insurance&quot;&gt;Catastrophic plans&lt;/a&gt; are only available to people under 30. These plans come with high deductibles and assume the holder will not be using the benefits much, if at all. However, premiums are low, averaging about $173 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

Authority. Trust. Though there are several reasons brands engage in content marketing, these are the top three. According to<a class="moretag" href="/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:00:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Expertise. Authority. Trust. Though there are several reasons brands engage in content marketing, these are the top three. According to Moz, companies strive to &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/google-e-a-t&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/google-e-a-t&quot;&gt;achieve E-A-T&lt;/a&gt; for two reasons: To boost their reputations and to make Google happy. While you can use several content marketing techniques to appeal to target audiences and gain rankings, one of the simplest and best ways to do both is to hyperlink to your sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How hyperlinking helps build E-A-T&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for brands to avoid hyperlinking to the sources they use out of fear of sending visitors away from their sites. While this is a possibility, losing one or two readers is a small price to pay for establishing yourself as an authority and gaining the majority of visitors’ (and Google’s) trust. So how, exactly, does hyperlinking help build E-A-T? Below are the top four ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Build a network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have had other practices or industry authorities link to your content, you know just how precious a backlink can be. For each backlink you receive, you may notice a slight increase in your rankings, and you may feel a surge of gratitude that encourages you to pay the kindness forward. Other brands feel this way, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By linking to other professionals within your field, as well as to industry experts, you put yourself on their radar and secure a soft spot in their hearts. When those professionals need to cite, say, a dental professional, they may think of you first. The more websites you link to, the more backlinks you stand to receive. A word of caution though: Link only to credible and relevant sites, as linking for the sake of linking could put you on Google’s radar for all the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Boost credibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hyperlink is the content marketing equivalent of a footnote. Just as you had to do when writing a college paper or dissertation, cite your sources. Citing, referencing, or referring to the publications from which you gained your information tells your audience that you did your homework and are a source to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Increase usability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s consumers are more informed than ever before, and not because they have to be, but because they want to be. Most people do not take the information given to them at face value. They digest it, research it, and then research it some more before deciding what they want to do with it. Make things easier on your audience by applying hyperlinks to your content. Doing so allows them to easily verify your material, answer any questions they have, and find related content through which they can learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Increase time-on-site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not always have to link to outside sources. If you have an extensive library of valuable content, make each piece work harder for you by sending your readers to them. In addition to including hyperlinks directly in the content, attach a list of “Related Content” at the bottom. These tactics have been proven to increase time-on-site, which also happens to improve search rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Invest in your online reputation&lt;/h2&gt;

However, the saying that all press is good press<a class="moretag" href="/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 11:00:46 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Word-of-mouth marketing is undoubtedly important for every business, large and small. However, the saying that all press is good press is not true. Negative WOM is very damaging to a brand’s reputation and bottom line, especially when the brand in question is an “underdog.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effects of negative WOM marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOM marketing relies on first-hand accounts of a person’s experience with a business. First-hand accounts are immediately more credible than typical marketing, as consumers do not get paid to leave reviews. Brands use positive testimonials to attract new customers for this reason. However, whereas positive reviews increase trust and influence purchases, negative reviews have an adverse effect. Below are just a few ways NWOM can undermine the results from all other marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in attitude toward a brand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the findings from a study conducted by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;amp;context=honors_theses&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;amp;context=honors_theses&quot;&gt;University of New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, consumers’ attitudes toward a brand are adversely impacted by negative reviews. The study focused on both “top dogs” and “underdogs.” While both big and small businesses saw a negative impact from public criticism, the underdogs suffered more from bad press than larger corporations. Additionally, participants’ perceived brand value decreased when they were presented with negative information about a company. Again, the drop was more significant for small brands than large ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is that positive reviews had little to no effect on participants’ perceptions of brands. This finding shows just how powerful negative word-of-mouth can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in purchase intention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative WOM does not just hurt a brand’s reputation. It also hurts a company’s bottom line. According to the study, negative reviews influenced participants not to make the purchase. Positive testimonials, however, had little to no impact on individuals’ purchase decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/studies/online-negative-word-of-mouth.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/studies/online-negative-word-of-mouth.html&quot;&gt;Spiegel Research Center&lt;/a&gt; study back those from the university: according to the center, individuals who viewed NWOM about a brand decreased their spending by 12% and their spending frequency by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult to overcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most frustrating thing about NWOM is its persistence. The impact of negative word-of-mouth marketing persists for far longer than the results of positive WOM. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322632227_Negative_Word-of-Mouth_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Adverse_Messages_on_Consumers&apos;_Reactions_on_Facebook&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322632227_Negative_Word-of-Mouth_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Adverse_Messages_on_Consumers&apos;_Reactions_on_Facebook&quot;&gt;2017 paper&lt;/a&gt;, the impact of bad press persists long after it has been refuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing your reputation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation management is critical to the success of your practice. Whether you are looking into online reputation management as a proactive or reactive measure, Doctor Genius is familiar with the most effective techniques for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/&quot;&gt;mitigating the damage caused by adverse online reviews&lt;/a&gt; about health care brands. Below are a few techniques used to improve or maintain clients&amp;#8217; online reputations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Respond to all online reviews, both positive and negative&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Write helpful blogs posts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Maintain a website and the reviews on it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ask patients to leave reviews&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Maintain an active social media presence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one way to keep patients happy, however, is to put forth the effort. Proactively manage your online reputation and digital presence to show patients you care.&lt;/p&gt;

What was once considered just one small part of the online &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/&quot;&gt;marketing equation&lt;/a&gt; has now become one of the main methods of communication for an entire generation of consumers. Content that is optimized specifically for mobile users is a vital addition to the marketing plan of businesses in every industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reaching mobile users through mobile marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding innovative ways to reach mobile users is not just a short-lived marketing trend. To remain competitive in a generation of mobile-focused consumers, businesses and health care practices must continuously rethink online strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mobile optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, businesses focused on webpages that would likely be viewed on a computer. Building an option for the mobile view was secondary and, in most cases, did not include the same amount of information, often requiring the customer to view the full site for more material and additional details. Users want a mobile site that loads quickly, offers easy navigation, is pleasing to the eye, and provides engaging content. This makes it important to check back frequently for mobile site errors and review for user-friendliness using test groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Search engine optimization keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that when building a mobile-optimized site, SEO keywords are still just as crucial as on a traditional website. Since most Google searches are now completed on mobile devices, the Google Webmaster Central Blog reports that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html&quot;&gt;search engine indexing&lt;/a&gt; system has evolved to prioritize these searches. Whereas website users are willing to browse through several options in the search queue, mobile users rarely select options beyond the first few that become available. This trend in preference makes SEO keyword selection and use more vital than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Voice command popularity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile users are no longer relying solely on text and images to gain information. The rising popularity in voice command technology has made SEO keyword usage a priority for mobile site design. When users activate voice command and make a request, the keywords are analyzed and search results index accordingly. Making sure related keywords are present on the mobile site or app means a higher likelihood of coming up on that index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;App design and utilization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some mobile users, an optimized site is not enough to stay engaged. Repeat customers benefit from the development of an app that is user-friendly and interactive. Along with an app that stands out, the integration of SEO keywords using terminology that is specifically reserved for apps increases the likelihood of the app coming up in a search. App store optimization keywords are a new frontier that many businesses are just now learning to explore, so during the design process, it helps to research the ASO keywords most frequently used in the specific business field. &lt;/p&gt;

In fact, according to HubSpot, more businesses actively invest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics&quot;&gt;online content creation&lt;/a&gt; (70%) than those that invest in search engine marketing strategies (64%). Because so many brands focus on content creation, the online landscape is more saturated with content than ever before. To break through all the noise and ensure your brand comes out on top, you need to take a deep dive into your audience’s habits and behaviors to gain a better understanding of the type of content it really wants to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top 3 reasons to tailor your online content to your general audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of content marketing, brands used content simply as a means of funneling leads to their sites. Rarely did brands focus on filling their landing pages with quality and helpful content. While this tactic may have worked way back when, it will not fly today. Today, speaking to one’s general audience is more important to online success than ever. Below are the top three reasons this is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Identify more appropriate keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though SEO takes a backseat to targeted content, there is still value in keyword research and placement. After all, if you do not use the right keywords, you will struggle to reach your target audience. While an SEO agency can help you perform thorough keyword research, a large part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/key-prosperous-practiceare-using-effective-keywords/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/key-prosperous-practiceare-using-effective-keywords/&quot;&gt;identifying appropriate terms and phrases&lt;/a&gt; entails knowing your audience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://neilpatel.com/blog/audiences-vs-keywords/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://neilpatel.com/blog/audiences-vs-keywords/&quot;&gt;Neil Patel&lt;/a&gt;, the best way for brands to sabotage their content marketing strategy is to target everyone. By targeting everyone, brands attract no one. Instead, companies should seek to understand what words and phrases their unique audiences use to search for their products and services. In doing so, they may limit the number of searches in which they show up, but they increase their odds of showing up in searches conducted by more serious leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Increase engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attracting leads to your website is only half the battle. The other half entails engaging visitors enough to convince them to do business with you. If your visitors do not care about what you have to say, it is highly unlikely they will care about what you have to sell. The best way to engage audiences is to identify their unique pain points, wants, and concerns, and craft content around those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Build relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important reason to speak to your general audience is to build relationships and brand loyalty. Remember, online competition is fierce. For consumers, supply is not the problem. The problem lies in deciding in which brand to place one’s loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set your business apart from the competition by communicating with your audience on an intimate and authentic level. Though doing so will require considerably more effort than merely pumping out generic content, your efforts will pay off, as defined audiences are quicker to dedicate their loyalty because they feel as though they are truly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start defining your target audience today&lt;/h2&gt;

But when you step<a class="moretag" href="/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 18:00:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When your practice struggles financially, the initial urge might be to reduce costs, including marketing expenditures. But when you step back and view your practice more objectively within the broader economic conditions, you might recognize the need for a more thoughtful strategy and a different approach. Historical trends provide lessons to medical practices seeking ways to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic&amp;#8217;s impact on their bottom line. Winners happened to be those businesses and practices that went against the current, either maintain marketing expenditures or increasing them. Therefore, your medical practice&amp;#8217;s key to successfully emerging from the recession is continued investments in marketing and, more significantly today, digital marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyclical Nature of the Economy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, a country&amp;#8217;s economic activity experiences periods of expansion and contraction. Determining which stage an economy is in requires analysis of the gross domestic product (GDP), national rates of employment, level of retail sales, and amount of personal income. Business cycles progress through a set pattern, but the length of each phase in this pattern varies. These cycles are demarcated by periods of economic expansion and contraction: also referred to as peaks and troughs, respectively. Historically, U.S. business cycles average about six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely tracking the trends in cycles reveals that there are six stages an economy goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expansion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the expansion period, employment levels, business profits, wages, and overall demand and supply are high. The money supply moves continuously and uninterrupted. Consumer confidence is high, and so is spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the economy reaches its maximum growth level, known as the peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recession&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the peak, a recession begins, and economic activity shrinks. Recessions typically experience high unemployment, negative economic growth, fewer sales as consumer demand declines, stagnation or drop in income, and less production output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression furthers the declines of recession, with significant decreases in employment, investment, production, and consumer confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trough represents the lowest point in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery phase begins the improvement in the economy, as economic activity begins to increase. Low prices contribute to increased levels of demand, and production and employment levels start to rise. Investment, confidence, and spending also start to increase. This is the final stage of a complete business cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The economy predictably experiences ups and downs as it progresses through multiple stages: expansion, peak, recession, depression, trough, and recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;These stages make a complete business cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signs of Economic Recession&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/cycles/june2020.html&quot;&gt;National Bureau of Economic Research&lt;/a&gt; (NBER) maintains a chronology of business cycles. The NBER tracks various indicators every month to determine the economy&amp;#8217;s point in the business cycle. According to the NBER, the United States entered the beginning of a recession in March 2020, based on the significant decline in economic activity throughout the economy, including record-level unemployment and a sharp drop in industrial production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peak in the U.S. economy&amp;#8217;s monthly economic activity occurred in February, marking the end of a 128-month period that was the longest expansion in the history of U.S. business cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 public health emergency inspired a decline in employment and production of unprecedented magnitude that reaches across the entire economy. This recession has different dynamics than prior recessions, due to the pandemic, and might last for a briefer time. But the disease&amp;#8217;s progression, governmental responses to the pandemic, and individual behaviors cannot be known with any certainty. What is known is that the expansion stage is an economy&amp;#8217;s normal state, with most recessions brief, lasting from six months to a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaway:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The United States entered a recession, fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marketing Spending During a Recession&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a recession begins, overall spending tends to shrink. Businesses&amp;#8217; finances start to suffer. Thus, to balance less revenue, the budgets begin to allocate less spending. Perks and plans for expansion are among the first areas that a company cuts, along with marketing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/what-marketers-and-agencies-might-expect-if-recession-happens/2195251&quot;&gt;Ad spending dropped&lt;/a&gt; about 12% in 2009, the last year of the most recent recession. Some experts estimate that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketingweek.com/mark-ritson-marketing-spend-recession-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;ad spend likely will shrink by 30 to 60&lt;/a&gt;% through 2020. A survey of marketers found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketingweek.com/marketing-campaigns-delays-rise-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;90% either are delaying or revising their marketing budgets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most business managers tend to believe that spending funds on marketing efforts during a time when customers are spending less just cuts into profits. In the short term, this could be accurate. Reducing marketing spending in a recession might protect immediate profits, but only briefly. But neglecting marketing during an economic downturn results in a weakened brand and fewer profits post-recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savvy business owners realize that marketing expenditures have the potential to contribute to profits in the longer term. The evidence clearly and consistently shows that it pays to maintain or even increase investments in marketing during an economic downturn. The rationale is that while others reduce their spending on marketing, there is a greater opportunity to have a share of voice when competitors go silent. Expert marketing consultants often teach their clients to actually increase advertising spending during recessions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2019/09/05/when-a-recession-comes-dont-stop-advertising/#3675901a4608&quot;&gt;take advantage of the lower cost.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaway:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Most businesses reduce marketing spending during economic downturns, though continuing or increasing marketing would be better for the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increasing spending can help increase awareness and take advantage of cheaper marketing costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Counter-Cyclical Strategy for Advertising and Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people and businesses follow a pro-cyclical approach to spending and investment. Their behaviors correspond with the stage of the business cycle. For example, when there is economic expansion and prosperity, many individuals and companies will engage in behavior that falls in line with that growth and serves to extend the period. Consumers buy more things, and companies invest more in areas like marketing. During an economic recession, the majority pro-cyclically cut their spending and reduce their investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A counter-cyclical strategy does not cut spending during times of economic contraction, and businesses that use a counter-cyclical strategy are more likely to survive. (At Doctor Genius, we follow a counter-cyclical strategy.) A century of research supports this approach. For example, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/when-the-going-gets-tough-the-tough-dont-skimp-on-their-ad-budgets/&quot;&gt;McGraw-Hill Research study&lt;/a&gt; examined 600 companies from 1980 to 1985. The businesses that maintained or increased their level of advertising expenditures during the recession experienced significantly higher sales when the economy recovered than companies that decreased ad spending. Specifically, aggressive advertisers during the recession had sales 256% higher than the companies that chose not to advertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few examples follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kellogg&amp;#8217;s triumph over Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post entered the Great Depression as the category leader in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spinsucks.com/communication/what-kelloggs-and-the-great-depression-can-teach-you-about-pr-and-marketing/&quot;&gt;ready-to-eat cereal market&lt;/a&gt;. During the depression, Post significantly cut its advertising budget while Kellogg&amp;#8217;s followed a counter-cyclical approach, doubling its advertising spend. Kellogg&amp;#8217;s heavily invested in radio advertisements and introduced a new cereal, Rice Krispies. Kellogg&amp;#8217;s overtook Post as the category leader, growing its profits by 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toyota&amp;#8217;s rise to the top imported carmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis triggered a 17-month recession from 1973-75. Toyota&amp;#8217;s sales of its fuel-efficient cars were strong, but the company resisted the temptation to reduce its ad budget when the economic downturn came. By 1976, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adage.com/article/news/ten-things-learn-70s-recession/131670&quot;&gt;Toyota surpassed all competitors&lt;/a&gt; to become the top imported carmaker in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Target&amp;#8217;s recession success&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2010/03/roaring-out-of-recession&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; analyzed the strategies and corporate performance of thousands of companies during three global recessions, finding only about 9% flourished after a slowdown in terms of sales and profits growth. These companies balanced cutting costs to survive the recession and investing for the post-recession. The companies most successful after the recession focused more on operational efficiency improvements and spent more on marketing, research and development, and new assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of a company that successfully balanced short-term needs with long-term planning is Target. Target responded to the 2000 recession with a reduction in its operating costs, narrowing distribution margins, and a 20% increase in its sales and marketing budget. The company&amp;#8217;s sales grew by 40% over the course of the recession, and its profit margin increased to 10% in the three years after the recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A counter-cyclical strategy does not cut spending during a recession.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Research from several recessions in U.S. history demonstrates that companies following a counter-cyclical approach to marketing are more likely to succeed than competitors who cut advertising spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why a Counter-Cyclical Marketing Strategy Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A counter-cyclical approach that increases marketing spending during a downturn makes sense and is effective for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gain market voice and market share&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recession provides opportunities to gain market share and market leadership. Businesses that maintain their marketing budget while competitors cut theirs automatically increase their share of voice. Share of voice leads to gaining market share and long-term benefits. Additionally, your message is more likely to be heard when fewer competitors advertise. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/&quot;&gt;amplify your online presence&lt;/a&gt; and market voice through several means, which Doctor Genius can help you utilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep brand current in consumer minds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining or increasing marketing efforts keeps your company in the forethought of consumers. When purchase decisions are made, a customer is more likely to choose your brand, since it is more easily remembered in consumer minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retain brand loyalty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary source of cash flow and practice growth is a loyal customer base. Developing and then maintaining a strong brand, one that patients recognize and trust, is one of the best ways to minimize business risk. Continued marketing outreach even during an economic downturn works to keep loyal customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Convey confidence and stability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When consumers observe a company that continues to advertise during a down economy, the impression usually made is of a stable and confident company. Business decision-makers feel more positive about that company&amp;#8217;s commitment to its products and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increase relative spending.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a recession, the cost of advertising space falls, the battle to appear in search results becomes less aggressive, and fewer companies invest in a good SEO content strategy. Even if your marketing spending remains the same, your relative spending will increase. You will get more advertising distribution, with less competition. A recession is a good time to invest in marketing because you get more for your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cyclical approach, in which the business cuts marketing costs in economic recessions, damages the business&amp;#8217;s long-term chances for success. Not advertising decreases brand awareness, lowers search result rankings, and diminishes brand loyalty. These are very expensive to regain once lost, especially once the economy recovers and competition again increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Counter-cyclical marketing investment brings a greater share of voice and market share, builds brand recognition and loyalty, conveys confidence, and increases the amount of relative spending.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cyclical marketing weakens a company&amp;#8217;s market position and makes regaining that position after the recession more challenging and more expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marketing Steps to Take During a Recession&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending alone does not bring benefits. Rather, the spending must be strategic. Benefits come to the practices that are responsive to the market fluctuations and changes in their patients&amp;#8217; circumstances and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 crisis, patients&amp;#8217; daily activities have changed, and so too must medical practices. Small offices&amp;#8217; marketing strategies must adapt to changes in circumstances and behaviors. For example, as the majority of Americans sheltered in place with limited physical interactions, the reliance on virtual networks grew. More and more people are spending greater amounts of time in front of a screen. Conventional marketing tactics will not work in unconventional times. To reach your patients, you need to go where they are spending much of their time: online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help your patients find you online by following some &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/&quot;&gt;fundamentals of digital marketing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Focus on gaining social media presence and engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create videos useful to your patients and potential patients.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of your website and blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjust your SEO strategies. To more easily be found during online searches, your practice requires good SEO practices that are up-to-date to reflect not only Google&amp;#8217;s&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/&quot;&gt; changes in its ranking algorithms&lt;/a&gt; but your patients&amp;#8217; and potential patients&amp;#8217; shifting needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a recession, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2009/04/how-to-market-in-a-downturn-2&quot;&gt;consumer spending and priorities shift&lt;/a&gt;. You need to recognize the changes in your patients&amp;#8217; interests and intentions, and you must adjust your marketing strategies and messaging. The pandemic behind the recession further complicates efforts, adding an additional layer of concerns and considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should also increase the frequency of posts and the range of content published. As Nielson reports, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/covid-19-tracking-the-impact-on-media-consumption/&quot;&gt;time online has increased by 215%&lt;/a&gt;. This is true despite a reported decrease in online marketing by traditional retails. In other words, this means that there is an opportunity to increase one&amp;#8217;s share of voice during this downturn that has the capacity to reap demonstrable growth. As we&amp;#8217;ve reported on during previous blogs, our clients have seen record highs in views. Clients at our higher tiers have seen this effect amplified as they post content more frequently and in a wider breadth of formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Having a marketing plan that bolsters the frequency and category of content during this time can improve ranking substantially during the COVID recession.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your marketing budget should remain the same or increase during the recession.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your practice needs digital marketing, including social media and website with an SEO focus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Understand how patients&amp;#8217; priorities have shifted and adjust marketing accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The goal of your website should be to provide useful, unique content that answers those questions or fills those needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is not enough to merely design a useful website. You must also develop a website that ranks high enough for the right keywords that users can find your website. The credibility of your website plays a vital role in how well your site will rank in search engines. Doctor Genius can help you build the credibility your site needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;E-A-T&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-A-T, which stands for expert, authoritative, and trustworthy, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf&quot;&gt;guiding principle&lt;/a&gt; behind how Google&amp;#8217;s search quality raters evaluate a site&amp;#8217;s fit for a given keyword search. It also plays a big role in how the automated algorithm ranks sites. The two main determining factors of how much E-A-T your site has are the quality of your site and the quality of the links to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Site quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a quality site should be your primary goal. You do not just want to attract visitors. You want those visitors to stay on your site and become customers. Additionally, quality content will help you get quality backlinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate E-A-T on your site, you should focus on creating unique, useful, updated and accurate content. Your content should be free of grammatical errors, well-written and authoritative. Your site design should appear professional and well-organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh, original content ranks much better than stale, copied content. To keep your E-A-T high, you need to post new, original, high-quality content continually. Additionally, you should always base your content on authoritative sources, such as academic journals, and use original sources wherever possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your users should be able to easily find a detailed description of your credentials, name, address, location, contact information and privacy policy. It is important that users be able to quickly ascertain who is producing the content on your site, what their level of expertise is, and that they are a real person or organization who can be contacted easily with questions or concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Backlink quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google algorithm relies heavily on quality links from other sites to determine how much E-A-T your site has. Links from popular sites with high E-A-T will improve your site&amp;#8217;s E-A-T much more than links from sites with low traffic or questionable reputations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our content marketing team at Doctor Genius can help you identify and secure links from the types of sites that can most help you build E-A-T and improve your search engine rankings. &lt;/p&gt;

Consistency in brand messaging is one of the keys to ensuring that your online presence always communicates your core brand values. Doctor Genius can provide a personalized online presence, packed with fresh and unique content that will help you drive sales and stand out from your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of brand consistency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are you have invested a lot of thought, effort, and money into standardizing the way your facilities and employees represent your brand in your practice. It is just as essential to ensure that your online presence consistently reflects your desired brand image. A consistent brand helps you project professionalism and establish authority and authenticity. It avoids confusing clients and builds trust with them while providing your business with internal direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Designing your online presence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your online presence needs to consistently reflect your brand values while also attracting visitors and converting those visitors into customers or patients. Doctor Genius can help you with a design strategy that both strengthens your brand and improves your results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emphasize what makes you unique&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stand out from your competitors, you need to identify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/328078&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/328078&quot;&gt;what makes your practice unique&lt;/a&gt; and make sure your clientele know about it. This is not the time to be humble. Your website and other online communications should tell your patrons exactly what your practice does well and how that benefits them so that they know why they should choose you instead of your competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Be easy to find&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best website in the world will not do you much good if no one can find it. As an SEO agency, Doctor Genius can design a high-converting, mobile-friendly website for you that places you high in the search results for your chosen keywords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apply your brand guidelines to your online presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a bit of adaptation, you should be able to apply the same brand guidelines you use in your practice to your online presence. It is important to use the same graphics, logos, and fonts you use in your printed, in-office, and other marketing materials on your website and in your social media and e-mail communications. You want your patients to recognize all of your communications as coming from you instantly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep your online messaging consistent&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Keep a standard tone across channels&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose channels that align with your brand values&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Work with influencers who will commit to brand consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It takes a new approach that focuses on improving the patient&amp;#8217;s experience and view of oral care. Gary Kadi, from Next Level Practice, has the plan to relaunch practices and help them make the changes they need to take their practice to the next level. To achieve this, we can help review every aspect of your practice and find the key areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question many people are asking is, &amp;#8220;how to transition into a complete health practice?&amp;#8221; This is where the relaunch program helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the Relaunch Program?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram&quot;&gt;The Relaunch Program&lt;/a&gt; is a one-month step-by-step coaching program with one of our NextLevel expert coaches. The coach will work with the client, providing a concrete written plan. This plan will help inspire your team to provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Outstanding patient care&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increase productivity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Optimize profitability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This program helps promote &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/relaunch-program-part-1-complete-health-practice-with-gary-kadi-and-doctor-genius/&quot;&gt;complete health dentistry,&lt;/a&gt; which involves an entirely new approach to dental care. Instead of only viewing a patient&amp;#8217;s oral health, dentists consider how one&amp;#8217;s oral health affects the rest of the body before customizing a new treatment for a healthier lifestyle. This program features three one-hour sessions with your very own coach, who will work with you one-on-one. This will allow your advisor to build a strong report, as they continue to provide solutions uniquely tailored to your brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Many Sessions are in the Relaunch Program?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Relaunch program is in three main sessions, Launchpad, Trajectory, and Launch Plan. Each session&amp;#8217;s goal is to help lay the foundation for your unique relaunch plan and map out the process step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Session 1: Launchpad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first session, the coach will help define your goals for your practice and career. After all, the only way to truly enhance your practice is to flesh out your ideal vision. This session is the first step to relaunching your practice in a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Session 2: Trajectory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second session, the coach will go over your practice&amp;#8217;s history, available services, profitability, and more. This session&amp;#8217;s goal is to take a &amp;#8220;snapshot&amp;#8221; of the practice and create a clear picture of the areas of opportunity for growth. The coach can also help find the areas that will need the most change, helping you boost the efficiency of your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Session 3: Launch Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last session involves developing a clear plan for your practice from where it is now, to where you want it to be. While the steps remain the same, each plan is customized to the individual client&amp;#8217;s practice. Thus, you will be able to develop the ideas for your practice and achieve substantial results. We will help guide your practice in the direction it needs to go while working within the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take Your Practice to the Next Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the direction of Gary Kadi, NextLevel Practice offers multiple options that include the Relaunch Program.

&lt;p&gt;Even amidst the changes COVID-19 has caused to the way dental and health care works, patients are still seeking treatment. Due to the new situation for many patients in your community, it is crucial to learn how to tap into that market and offer the healthy lifestyle your services can provide. Doctor Genius has partnered with Gary Kadi, CEO of NextLevel Practice, to help clients like yourself face uncertainty while reopening your practice with a focus to adjust for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Who is Gary Kadi?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO of NextLevel Practice, Gary Kadi is also an advocate, author, and documentarian. Kadi authored Million Dollar Dentistry, a book that promotes dentists building a healthy practice for healthy patients and healthy lives. Kadi has guided NextLevel Practice to create over 1.6 billion in increased collections, 50,000 more true vacation weeks, and over 6 million healthier patients with practices. Kadi strives to help dentists educate their patients, empower their teams, and improve their finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is a Complete Health Practice?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete Health Dentistry is a philosophy that focuses on maintaining good oral health in order to improve your overall general health. When you see your Complete Health Dentist for one of your preventive dental checkups, you’re not only taking care of your mouth but also your body. They will not only clean your teeth but also check for the early warning signs of both periodontal disease, oral cancer, and more. You’d be surprised what your mouth can tell you about the health of your entire body!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, a practice that believes in and practices Complete Health Dentistry integrates all areas of dental medicine in order to bring harmony to the mouth and body. Complete Health Dentistry Services Include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A clean and attractive smile&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cavity detection and treatment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gum disease therapy to stop the spread of this bacterial infection&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Oral cancer screening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How is Complete Health Dentistry Becoming the New Normal?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gary Kadi explains, there are four main areas of the new normal in dentistry, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Less time for traditional dentistry methods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increased expenses&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Patient scarcity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A new focus on selling health on a website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the purpose of the Complete Health Practice Plan?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Complete Health Practice Plan is to provide our clients with the framework for a thriving practice in a new world. Our framework is an extension to Gary Kadi’s NextLevel Practice coaching products and programs, who work to create a “Healthy Practice” to make patients healthier. The Practice Plan’s end goal is to improve the health of the patient, team, and practice by conveying the connection between oral health and overall health. The Complete Health Practice brings to light the areas of the body and conditions most prominently related to untreated oral health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process involves reviewing the patient’s medical history for signs of issues such as diabetes, inflammation, or high blood pressure that can correlate to the treatment and prevention of oral health issues. The patient’s experience from the initial call to the discussion of treatment plans will be focused on their overall health through achieving a healthy mouth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content and messaging of a dentist’s website are valuable because you are educating patients about the practice, what the goal of the practice is, and the reason the patient needs it. Our clients can help build a positive relationship with patients for regular checkups in the future. We will ensure that patients receive your message about Complete Health Dentistry through your website and online marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Selling Health Through Educating Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients are becoming better informed about dental care as our culture continues to increase its emphasis on the importance of a healthy lifestyle. With educating content, dentists can help patients understand the importance of proper dental care and how to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How can educating content help increase the flow of patients?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our premium plans feature additional services that allow for customized content such as website copy, dental service pages, blogs, etc. We can develop content that sends the right message for what your practice is all about, combining SEO value to help increase your rankings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How can you help my website rank?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While helping a website to remain active, Doctor Genius continues to monitor and stay up to date on &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/&quot;&gt;Google’s algorithm updates&lt;/a&gt;. When Google changes the way their search algorithm operates, there is a chance that a website’s position on a search results list will fluctuate. Even though this can work in favor of certain fields (medical, entertainment, news, etc.), other websites can face lower ranking. Many feel the effects of a core update may seemingly be unpredictable. However, our team tracks industry experts and corporate publications to follow the breadcrumbs that reveal where Google will likely shift focus on what content ranking is more important. &lt;/p&gt;

Above all else, it informs potential customers and clients of the products and services you offer. An integral part of a business page is the blog. These posts should contain relevant content and utilize terms to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/&quot;&gt;increase SEO optimization&lt;/a&gt; and E-A-T rankings among search engines that direct traffic to the site. Older blog posts may seem to do nothing but take up space; however, even outdated, keeping them may prove beneficial. Learn why your old content is still essential and what you can do to keep it relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What purpose do old blog posts serve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertadams/2017/04/10/23-proven-ways-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website/#3ddda45e2654&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertadams/2017/04/10/23-proven-ways-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website/#3ddda45e2654&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, company blogs are a way to reach a broader audience by posting information and articles relevant to the business. The more traffic posts get, the higher the site is ranked in search engine analytics, which boosts it in results. When people visit a business site, they like to see an established platform and history. A blog with a higher number of relevant and appropriate posts also lends credence to the business&amp;#8217;s credibility. Thus, deleting older posts may not only detract from that but also inadvertently remove articles that continue to perform well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can you make old content relevant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a search of your blog brings up poor writing or posts that no longer apply, then you may consider deleting them. However, instead of doing that, and risking a decrease in traffic or credibility, there are things you can do to make them relevant again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You already know that consistently creating new content helps site visitors to see that you are engaging and relevant. Make older posts productive again by linking them in your newer posts. If a former piece has stood the test of time and is accurate, relevant, and well-written, repost it. There is nothing wrong with recycling material to continue benefiting your business. You may also want to drop blog links in other content on your site. Doing so may garner more views for older posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your older blogs may have some outdated information. There is nothing wrong with correcting things that are now irrelevant or incorrect. Fix company contact information if that has changed, but do it without deleting the old. If former customers search your previous address or phone number, you still want the traffic directed to your page. Also, leave relevant SEO terms in place as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Promote your business wisely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a company website is to capture potential clients. At Doctor Genius, we understand how to construct blog posts and flow to garner your business the most traffic. We can take care of your blog posts, maintain the entire website, and take care of all social media sites.

The debate persists partially due to the incorrect assumption that content that appears as duplication will automatically be categorized as spam by search engines. At Doctor Genius, we strive to provide the most up-to-date and accurate information for your business. That&amp;#8217;s why learning more about how content duplication affects your &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/&quot;&gt;rankings&lt;/a&gt; can help you make informed decisions about the focus of your marketing and content strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should businesses avoid duplicate content? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking about repetitive content on the web, it&amp;#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of believing that if your information is too similar to existing information, it will be automatically be ranked lower on searches. Since somewhere between 25-30% of information on the web is repetitive, it would do a great disservice to consider all of it useless or spam. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZY7EmjbMA&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZY7EmjbMA&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&quot;&gt;Search engine programming has evolved&lt;/a&gt; to anticipate duplicated information and provide solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is duplicate content? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content on the internet that is duplicated can be due to the same page being used for multiple locations of the same company or through small parts of existing content being directly reused in blogs as a reference to the original material. Although sometimes duplications are used as manipulation or with malicious intent, such as trying to pass off reused content as new, original content, most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en-&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en-&quot;&gt;duplicated content&lt;/a&gt; on the web is harmless. Often, multiple variations of the same information end up as duplicate content due to publishing both HTTP and HTTPS versions of websites, pages in different languages, and both www and non-www pages. When the same pages are optimized for both website and mobile use, it can also create repetitive content for search engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do search engines treat duplicate content? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search engines, such as Google, look for identical or very similar pages as a regular part of the content ranking process. Instead of rejecting search results that are the same, the results are instead grouped together under the same search. Similar articles appear as alternative options to the first-ranked article instead of being edited out of the search entirely. Whenever possible, the original source of the content ranks highest along with the webpages that have the most visitors. Google, in particular, has updated algorithms to make sure webmasters aren&amp;#8217;t penalized in the rankings due to content duplication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn more about SEO content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that duplicate content on the web hurts companies by negatively affecting rankings is a myth that has been perpetuated by predatory SEO competitors. As confirmed by search engine engineers and major companies, repetitive content is expected and accounted for during the programming process, so it does not cause a problem unless it is purposefully overwhelming to the point of spam or clearly tries to pass off some else&amp;#8217;s original content as their own. &lt;a href=&quot;tel:877-477-2311&quot;&gt;Reach out to us&lt;/a&gt; to speak with a team member and learn more about our available services. &lt;/p&gt;

Along with content that displays the message you want your practice to send patients, it is crucial to create a positive patient experience. A patient’s experience typically begins with visiting your website where they then decide if they would like to proceed to appointments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is the patient experience that important for my website?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The simple answer is yes. User experience on a website for any medical practice can greatly influence the number of people that see the website and its success. When the right plan in place tailored to the patient’s needs, a dental practice can experience greater success and patient retention. Even with google’s algorithm constantly being updated, an area with consistent importance for ranking is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;improving a website&amp;#8217;s user experience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In an article on Search Engine Land, they explain how Google is working to include user experience on websites as a ranking factor. They explain, “That means if Google thinks your website users will have a poor experience on your pages, Google may not rank those pages as high as they are now.” While Google may not enact this update until 2021, there is no reason to avoid getting ready.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Doctor Genius can help enhance the patient experience on your website. Search Engine Land elaborates that the three areas affecting the patient experience on a website are the load time of pages, first input delay, and the visual stability of a page. In fact, Google states in their Webmaster Central Blog that “Through both internal studies and industry research, users show they prefer sites with a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;great page experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With these changes on the horizon, it is crucial to have a website and online presence that provides a positive and comfortable patient experience. We can help you build the practice website you need to boost your patients’ experiences from the website to a checkup in the office. For more information on keeping patients interested, please turn to our blog on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;how to use tech already at your disposal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What the Patient Experience Package Can do for You&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our team at Doctor Genius focuses on several areas of our client’s website to provide their practice with an effective and substantial online platform. These can include helping drive patient experience and loyalty, streamlining office operations, providing SEO-Centered content, helping clients stay connected with their patients, and promoting workplace safety. Amidst the post-COVID-19 outbreak world that we live in, people are interested in experiences and interactions with medical professionals that do not require unnecessary physical interaction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We can help to create an online system that promotes a positive experience and more. With the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Doctor Genius Practice Recovery Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, we can focus on adjusting your business to meet the needs of these changing times. We will customize the plan for your needs and utilize the Patient Experience Package benefits for even greater results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How can you help to streamline office operations?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One way to help streamline office operations involves paperless forms on the website. Patients will be able to fill out any and all forms online before the appointment. This way, there are no issues with printing out the forms, filling them out, or forgetting to bring them to the appointment. This can help make sure there is less chance of traffic in the waiting room, as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Even though the website can help to get new patients started with scheduling an appointment, we can also use phone systems to help filter calls. This way, the patient will have everything they need to get started from the comfort of their own home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can teledentistry help me remain in contact with my patients?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Yes. Teledentistry helps to make the process even easier for patients, allowing them to remain at home during the initial examination. Doctor Genius can help to set up a teledentistry system that will enhance the patient experience. This way, you can continue to communicate with patients, determine if they need to come to the office for treatment, and maintain oral health. This form of patient retention can also help them continue to reach out to your practice with any questions or concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will SEO get in the way of my message?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Not at all. While we will use SEO-focused content to help promote search results in Google listings, it is only one part of the solution. In fact, we will combine SEO with the type of message you want to send patients. Now, more than ever, patients need to know what practice is about and what they offer without issue. We will work with you to combine these into an effective and complete presentation online. You can find out more about how we are staying up to date on the latest changes in SEO best practices by reading how the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;most recent core update affects your practice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do I promote that we are following health and safety guidelines?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We can help to ensure that your office has the proper PPE, and standards in place following the COVID-19 outbreak. Along with that, we can help to advertise these factors through blogs and social media posts. This way, patients visiting your website will be able to access the information they need on this topic and know that you have their best interests in mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, our team strives to help practices build effective methods for maximizing their services with informative and active online content. Along with that, we can help clients reach patients in more ways than before with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will take the time to work with you and determine what your practice is going to need going forward. As the months in quarantine continue, there is a gradual decrease in the number of restrictions. With that in mind, dental practices must have a plan in place for when that happens. We can help to set this system up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What applies to businesses can also apply to dental and medical practices. Here are some various opportunities in store for dental practices that take a proactive approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Opportunities that lie ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies are not sitting idly and watching the situation unfold. They have adapted to the current situation and expanded their business models, reordered their production lines, and focused on new needs. The summary is that they have observed the market trends and taken calculated risks, using COVID-19 as the rocket fuel for growth in some areas and resuscitating dormant potentials in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many establishments are moving online, digitizing most of their processes to increase the speed of executing projects and eliminating backlogs. In terms of productivity, there has been a significant rise in cloud services for work collaborations, solutions to reduce paperwork and physical contact, reimbursement apps and digital solutions for accounting, and the rise of contactless devices in several areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius can help clients build an effective website and system that focuses on reaching patients. We will help to have a set plan in place for when the quarantine restrictions are lifted. The sooner dentists begin taking proactive steps toward the current situation, the sooner they can begin to prepare for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Business models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prolonged crisis like this can force changes in customer profiles. Customers’ behavioral patterns are likely to change due to a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, many people will start ordering more regularly and receive door deliveries, even after the lockdown. Others will possibly increase online transactions. Businesses that pay attention to the customer profile changes can go on to build more efficient business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Remote work and service delivery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renting an office space can be expensive, and remote work arrangement is yet to be adopted in the full functional scope. This will create opportunities in several and related sectors, including virtual classrooms, office space redesign, development of remote work platforms, online service provisions, software systems, and cloud-based services. All of these sectors will potentially witness drastic expansion when the world starts to recover from the pandemic, and employers look to reduce the cost of office space if their staff needs to work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call Us Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of the COVID-19 is under review by many experts, both in terms of medical and business implications. The adverse effects of the pandemic are obvious, but this article seeks to shed light on the opportunities that are available to businesses and other establishments when faced with a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

Along with businesses, dental practices also experience these issues, striving for a plan. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help dental and other medical practices have a plan in place for opening their practice back up after the quarantine. With our guidance and services, we can help you start things with a strong foot forward for your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recovering after a pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a dental or medical practice is dealing with hard times, the best option for the owner or manager is to stay calm and evaluate every possible opportunity. The following are potential points to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assess the condition of the practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform a business appraisal and decide what needs to be done urgently. It is crucial to evaluate what a dental practice has and follow current updates with the COVID-19 pandemic. As the U.S. shifts to summer, more and more restrictions will begin to loosen. With that, people will begin returning to their normal routines. Our team can help dentists evaluate what they will need to reopen effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to get creative and deal with the situation. The result of the appraisal will provide insights on whatever needs to be adjusted to get the business running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reach out to employees and customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some practices may be open for immediate health emergencies, not every practice can do that. In many cases, practices can reach out to any scheduled patient appointments to re-schedule appointments for a few months in the future. This includes letting them know the delays they might experience with certain services or is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees need to know if their schedules will change and the nature of work they need to do. They need to know if the practice will be restricting hours or if they will need to work remotely for some time. Our team can help go over teledentistry, what it is, and how it can help practices reach patients at home during COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reinvent the business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is easier for smaller businesses to modify their business models, switch focus, and get back into the game. Our team will help evaluate how to ensure dentists can effectively reach their patients while also offering advice on how to alter their practice methods during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to what customers might need and would buy, and direct business operations toward that. Aside from considering immediate service demands, evaluate past sales for indications of increase, decline, or stagnancy. If sales were declining or stagnant, the downtime might be the time to think about necessary changes to make when the economy gains pace once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-equity cash raise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek to raise money from non-equity sources. Develop strategies to get government grants. Consider the SBA initiatives in place to help small businesses. Be inventive about getting sources of cash to stay in business, including making short-term deals that relieve the current crunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call Us to Learn More&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like virtually everything in life, the COVID-19 pandemic will pass. It is difficult to predict what the economy and the country will look like afterward, but if the company survives this, there are opportunities to grab. Stay alert and get ready to bounce back after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, there is still hope for businesses and private practices. At Doctor Genius, we can help dentists, and other practices maximize their online presence and reach in the digital market. These steps, when done correctly, can help you chart your way toward building a strong, healthy, and resilient practice following the quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building a resilient business after a pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies are creating contingency plans as precautions against COVID-19. Some are implementing or adapting existing plans, while others have to develop new plans. The following are measures that companies can take to build a stronger and healthier business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consider the effect of coronavirus on customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the industry, customers might be experiencing certain difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Business owners need to think strategically about the challenges that customers are facing and what can be done to help them. Using those facts, they can create a new sales pitch and structure their marketing plans to meet those challenges and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular business challenges typically worsen during a crisis. Business owners have the role of restructuring their product offerings to address the specific struggles faced by their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adopt new sales mediums&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the total lockdown, people will need to make purchases, providing opportunities to offer your products or services through alternative sales channels. For instance, if COVID-19 is halting customer visits to the company’s store, it is time to target and expand eCommerce channels. Business owners need to review their internet marketing efforts and e-commerce sales and see how they provide a boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus more on conversations on social media and LinkedIn over physical sales meetings. Many B2B companies, especially those who deal with software or digital services and solutions, are already in this realm. The business continues, and more of it might need to go online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus on long-term investments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus disease situation might be the cue to make long-term investments in the business, especially those in B2B sales. If there is a momentary relapse in sales, then the time is right to reevaluate operations, processes, and existing platforms and get strategic for the long term. If there are major prospects in view, now is the time to dedicate more resources and effort into managing the leads and capitalizing on longer-term opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitor the leads, provide reassurances, and let everyone know that there are contingency plans in place and that they can access help when needed. This unparalleled situation is undoubtedly causing many cancellations like concert tickets, airline reservations, and business conferences. Still, high-ticket B2B sales may not suffer as much, unless the crisis continues for longer than anticipated, and companies start to reduce spending and investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call Us to Learn More Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic recovery might happen earlier than expected. If you fail to position your business strategically, however, you may not be well-placed to build on post-pandemic recovery. Companies can take salient measures now to ensure that they come out of a major crisis like COVID-19 stronger and healthier.&lt;/p&gt;

Here Are 5 Creative Ways to Keep Your WFH Space Safe and Happy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, most schools across the united states have closed.

For many parents who now have to work remotely, they may face additional challenges concentrating on work, and dealing with their kids as coronavirus disease continues to be a problem. Parents need to implement a setup that allows them to work undisturbed and keep everyone happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintaining a safe and happy WFH space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five creative ways to work productively at home by keeping the Work-From-Home, WFH, space safe and happy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Develop a schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a strict schedule that is identical to a normal school day can be helpful. The kids will continue to wake up, eat, and get dressed as usual. Then they can stay busy with assignments. When they are engaged, parents can focus on getting their work done. During productive hours, the kids should be distracted with playtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide toys for the kids to play with and set time for them to use technology, away from the work area. Kids love movies or computer time, so maximize that. Educational websites are available to improve a child&amp;#8217;s creativity. When on a strict deadline, a new movie could work like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use door signs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should always be a private space, though; it could be the bedroom, closet, basement, guest room, or an area where one can have undisturbed quiet space. Separating the space makes drawing the line much easier. In the WFH space, there can be a sign on the door, so when they see the &amp;#8220;stop&amp;#8221; sign, they know not to come in unless there is something important going on. If the sign shows &amp;#8220;enter,&amp;#8221; then they can come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set boundaries for the children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to set boundaries for kids when working from home, especially if they are of school age. Parents can allow their kids to watch more TV and play games than usual to stay occupied. The kids need to understand that it is temporary, however. While they are at it, parents can tell them when they do not want to be disturbed. Even if there is no designated office space in the house, establishing clear boundaries with the kids can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Old-school activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before gadgets came around, puzzles and scrapbooking were the cool stuff. They can still work to keep children busy and keep the WFH space safe and happy while the COVID-19 lockdown lasts. These activities can be interesting, and more importantly, they tend to be time-consuming. So, encourage the kids to channel their inner craftmanship during workhours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is normal for children to desire attention. If both parents are working from home, creating shifts can make remote work much easier. If a parent works early in the morning, their partner can wake up the kids and handle tasks around the house. Switching shifts will allow parents to work uninterruptedly throughout the day. If switching shifts between partners are not feasible, especially for those whose partners cannot work remotely during the COVID-19 crisis, creating a strict schedule and planning could help optimize the day.&lt;/p&gt;

While working from home has its benefits, especially in terms of productivity, not every business can benefit from this setup. In fact, dentists and medical practices are finding themselves in unique situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Doctor Genius can help. Our goal is to help you utilize a practice website and digital platform to maximize your reach online while also helping patients when needed and allowed. For instance, many patients are unsure of what constitutes a dental emergency. Along with that, there are constant developments with teledentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With teledentistry, dentists can provide consultations to patients via video and voice chat, while they remain in their homes. However, it is essential for dentists to establish a work-home-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work-Home-Life Balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to finding a balance between work and daily routine lies in time management. The following tips help with time management and communication to make the day more productive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plan activities adequately&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specify the time for work. An alternative might be to stay flexible and divide time between work responsibilities and other tasks. It is advisable to inform colleagues of working hours for better coordination of work hours yet ensure effective collaboration. Identify long and short-term goals and meet set deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team at Doctor Genius can help to outline how dentists can adjust to this new work format, and learn how to balance the new schedules. In some cases, practices may offer emergency or immediate dental services for severe issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Work in a different area from the rest of the home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designate an “office space” that is solely dedicated to working. The workspace should be clean and free of clutters to prevent distractions. Everyone in the house should know about this space, so they know not to disturb throughout work hours. If there are kids around, parents can explain to them that sitting on a particular desk on an area means work, and they should only come around for important things. Letting family members understand the need to respect work time and space will allow healthy boundaries, regardless of the size of the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adopt office routines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home can affect productivity. Therefore, one can stick to the same work structure that exists in the office setting, including meetings with colleagues over video conferencing tools. This encourages a healthy routine to ensure productivity and successful work completion. The communication tools can promote relationships with colleagues, reduce loneliness, and preserve the team spirit. It would help to document work progress and share it with the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create time for breaks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home can make it hard to divide time between personal matters and work. There should be time for breaks to increase productively. Such breaks can be dedicated to favorite tasks such as exercising, cooking, or reading. Planning such activities provides something to anticipate after work. Exercises and mental breaks are important for health and well-being during the COVID-19 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tips above emphasize the importance of maintaining a level of discipline and structure as the day passes. By forming habits that promote effective time management and communication skills, you will be able to create a balance between your work and personal life. These routines might be hard to follow at first, but with persistence, you can make the remote work enjoyable while the COVID-19 pandemic lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to dental practices, patients still need dental treatment, urgent services, and information on what constitutes a dental emergency. It is the same way with all forms of medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are wondering how and when to reach out to medical professionals or businesses for how and when they can seek services. While the government is taking the time to iron out the details of re-opening the economy, medical practices can benefit from understanding what is going to happen and what the plan is for small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When and how to support local businesses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local businesses play essential roles in the nation’s economy. Communities grow and experience more innovations due to local establishments by creating jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities and support the community. They care about the community making the town stand out among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such businesses are dealing with financial strain currently and face uncertainty about the future. The following are ways to support local businesses during the COVID-19 crisis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Order from local stores&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who can afford to, it would certainly help if they tried their local stores or restaurants first when they need to buy something. Many restaurants now offer pickups and deliveries. Other places like the local toy store, spas, hair salon, hardware store, and childcare provider may not be selling from their physical stores, but they could be offering delivery and curbside pickup options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy gift cards or credit for future use from them. Some of these local stores may have adjusted their services to meet up demands in this period. For instance, local cleaners may now offer disinfecting services, and the toy store may have added homeschool supplies. For those who still have the financial means, it might help to keep paying workers like the hairstylist, nanny, and cleaners. They are usually hit the hardest because fewer people will be requesting their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoid refunds and continue subscriptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check online to see if any of the services are now available online. Service providers like tutors, personal trainers, yoga instructors, financial planners, coaches, music teachers, and lawyers — all of them can continue to render their services online via videos or online conferencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to pay for memberships and subscriptions, even if the services have been stopped temporarily. If payment has been sent for a canceled class, one may consider donating the money to the organization instead of requesting a refund. Alternatively, one can postpone booked services to a later date instead of canceling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Share the services online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a local business is offering special promotions or ideas, sharing it online might help increase its reach. Since local businesses do not often have great marketing efforts, their customers can help them share the news over social media. Those who are website designers, developers, or social media experts can render their services to local businesses without an online presence to promote their deals and sales online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Give tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When ordering takeaway goods from local restaurants, try to be more generous than usual, if possible. The extra funds, no matter how little, can help businesses and their staff who still have to work, as well as delivery people who typically work on a contract basis and have unstable wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call Us To Learn More Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and self-isolating rules are critical for curbing the spread of the disease but devastating for local businesses. The little steps you take can help your favorite businesses stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius has partnered with Bob Affleck, our resident Practice Financial Expert, to bring practices across the US a strategic plan and loan to refinance. He has been working alongside our team to aid practices through this unprecedented time. With the legislators across the US lifting restrictions put in place during the pandemic, medical practices having a clear roadmap on how to proceed with reopening is paramount. Along with having the appropriate PPE, scheduling appointments with limited hours of operation, communicating with patients, and more, practices need to have a plan to rebuild their office for the present and in the future. That&amp;#8217;s why we&amp;#8217;re excited to have world-class talent like Bob Affleck ready to help practices create a plan to rebuild and restore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Cash Flow Matters with Bob Affleck?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Cash Flow Matters webinar series strives to help dental and medical practice owners attain the practice growth and success they desire. When it comes to enhancing your practice, finances are a crucial aspect of your success. I&gt;t&amp;#8217;s also important to know what&amp;#8217;s changed in financing since quarantine went into effect, which is why speaking to an industry expert can prepare you to seek improved cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 20px;/* padding:20px!important; */margin:40px auto;width: 80%;font-size:1.2rem;&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-block btn-dark&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.doctorgenius.com/bobaffleck&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration:none;padding: 20px;width: 100%;height: 100%;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white&quot;&gt; to learn more about our program and how it can benefit your practice today!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who is Bob Affleck?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Affleck is a financial expert who has dedicated the past 30 years to helping thousands of dentists realize their dream of practice ownership and achieve the practice growth they desire. Cash Flow Matters is &amp;#8220;Not just about running a practice but being able to grow the practice, as well.&amp;#8221; With Bob Affleck, he explains that this is about helping practices &amp;#8220;Make the comeback stronger than the setback.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With experience as a practice finance specialist, a practice management consultant, and a practice broker, Affleck now works as an advisor and educator for dentists. With experience from the dental industry at all angles, Affleck has the expertise to help guide clients from the beginning of their career and onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Can the Cash Flow Matters Webinar do For Me?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By working with Affleck, this webinar demonstrates to clients how refinancing is a crucial step, but it is only the first step. While most dental practices have been in survival mode for the last few months, it is essential to begin thinking past tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the refinancing, it is crucial to have a plan. Through this webinar, we can help clients take their practice from survive to thrive. That begins with a sound online presence fueled by relevant, high-quality content. The Cash Flow Matters Webinar will help you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li &gt;Understand your current practice finances&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li &gt;Refinance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li &gt;Rebuild&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li &gt;Restore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/&quot;&gt;Doctor Genius Practice Recovery Blueprint&lt;/a&gt;, we go into detail on how Next Level Practice and Doctor Genius are partnered up to provide an opportunity for practice owners to bounce back.  This can help clients focus on reopening their practice. Now, we are delving more deeply into the aspects involving refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Your Current Practice Finances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help your practice grow and achieve the success you desire, it is essential to gain an understanding of your current finances. This includes reviewing all current practice loans, equipment loans, credit card debt, or other outstanding debt. We will also need to review the practice&amp;#8217;s ongoing costs for PPE, staff, and monthly expenses. From here, we can better evaluate what your practice needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to understanding your current practice finances, we will focus on several areas, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li &gt;Free up cash flows&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li &gt;Rebuild cash reserves&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li &gt;Invest in Health and Safety Equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li &gt;Invest in Marketing to Promote Safe Practice&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li &gt;Drive Profitability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius works with Bob Affleck to help practices strengthen and build upon the resources they need while also promoting their message to their healthcare communities and their patients. By evaluating your current finances, together, we can help customize a loan plan for how to begin the process of building a more stable financial foundation for a  successful practice in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refinance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After understanding a client&amp;#8217;s current finances, we can focus on refinancing. This process involves consolidating practice debt, freeing up cash flow, debt cash out, and other services we offer in our Recovery Blueprint plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What will consolidating practice debt do for me?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By organizing all unsecured debts into one monthly payment, we can help to establish the most effective payment system for it.  By using a loan to consolidate debt, you will be able to make one payment covering multiple debts instead of spending more time and resources keeping track of multiple payments. Affleck can help clients learn what they need in order to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In what other ways will this benefit the future of my practice?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.doctorgenius.com/bobaffleck&quot;&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt;, Affleck states that his goal is to educate clients &amp;#8220;on what it takes to grow the practice,&amp;#8221; and that, to do this, the &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Most important part is about understanding the business side of the practice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt; We are here to help you do that and begin the process of rebuilding a firm financial foundation beneath your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rebuild&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of rebuilding a practice includes implementing a new message and marketing platform. This message can incorporate your beliefs and overall goal for your practice while targeting keywords that promote your services. Doctor Genius can combine your message with SEO-focused content to help boost the chance of people finding your website in internet searches. This can also include content that goes over new health and safety measures in a post-COVID-19 world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content has been vital for keeping our clients engaged with their community during the pandemic. After completing a full performance audit on all Doctor Genius clients, our team found that they&amp;#8217;ve been experiencing more visibility to their sites. We also found that people were enjoying and reading the content on our client&amp;#8217;s websites to help them make informed decisions about their health. More people are reading blogs, spending more time on practice websites, and learning more about the services they need to make an informed decision. To continuously see positive results, it&amp;#8217;s essential to understand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/&quot;&gt;importance of social media, videos, and how to create effective blogs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do You market necessary dental care to patients in these trying times?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relevant concern patients have at this time is their safety when receiving dental care. We can help to promote any messages of having the proper equipment and taking all necessary measures to ensure the health of each patient. Your patients likely desire dental treatment even at this time; they just need the right message for them to feel comfortable returning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you customize the website to my specific services?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Along with customizing the content to specific services, we can help to fine-tune your systems to promote profitability. Affleck is here to help clients maximize the potential of profit for their practice. By working with us to rebuild your practice, we can help place your practice on the path toward success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to helping restore a practice, the Cash Flow Matters Webinar focuses on strengthening practice efficiencies and experiences. Similar to sending out a personalized message for potential patients, your website can also send a reassuring message to staff members. The goal of restoring a practice is more than merely boosting revenue. This process can also help clients discover new patient opportunities and methods of delivering quality care to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to restore your practice and begin working with a system that promotes more success in the future, then we can help.

During this is time,<a class="moretag" href="/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2020 13:00:22 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Businesses all over the country are adjusting their routines in reaction to the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic. During this is time, communities want all the information they can get to stay abreast of the situation. Doctor Genius is here to help dentists, and medical professionals stay ahead of the pandemic with a variety of services to boost their online presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help you take the necessary steps to continue promoting your practice during this time. We will guide you through using technology and methods of communication to stay in contact with your patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintaining a Line of Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are five tips for dental practices who want to use technology for conventional communication and maintain a connection with their communities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Livestream with Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentists and medical practices can use software to release the latest news about their operations, which will not only help address several concerns at a time but also connect the community during the lockdown. In many cases, a live stream video can make it easier for patinets to hear about available services, operating hours, updates on re-opening policies, and current health precautions your team is taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video conferencing services like Zoom, Facebook Livestream, and Google Hangouts are quick ways to engage the community while also providing video recordings for those who did not join the live session. If you are unsure how to utilize these services or want to learn how we can help, reach out to our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post press releases on social media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is shifting from traditional news release platforms to one where news channels are looking online for details instead of reading reports. By posting press releases with information for patients, you can further the chance of potential patients seeing that your practice. This is also an opportunity to post about if you are providing emergency services or opening for specific types of treatment. During this time, reaching as many patients as possible is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use eNewsletters to provide best practices and tips about staying at home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective way to share information is to leverage technologies used regularly by the entire community. Producing and sharing newsletters using web platforms allows people to stay informed easily, feel a connection with the community, and stay updated with the latest information about what is going on during the COVID-19 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a way to help patients know when they may need to seek treatment for certain dental issues or emergencies. Now more than ever, patients are in need of that advice since most offices are closed or under limited operating hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use social media to provide daily updates to the community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone uses social media nowadays, a fact that can be optimized. There are different forms for proactive communication, and providing vital information on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook is a seamless way to reassure people. At this time, people are looking for guides and want to stay informed on the latest updates from reliable sources. Even a picture or brief summary can deliver a strong message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call Us Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world deals with the changes in society due to the COVID-19 pandemic, dental practices and leaders must find ways to keep their employees and community informed, while easing their concerns. Doctor Genius can help you obtain the tools you need to help patients stay informed during this pandemic. Reach out to us to learn more today.&lt;/p&gt;

This action plan will allow you<a class="moretag" href="/using-kaizen-as-an-action-plan-for-your-practice/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/using-kaizen-as-an-action-plan-for-your-practice/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/using-kaizen-as-an-action-plan-for-your-practice/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 13:00:08 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you strive to improve your practice, a Kaizen action plan is a must. This action plan will allow you to make small changes that create continuous improvement for employees, patients, and the practice as a whole. These changes are small but can make a huge impact on your practice’s processes and functions. For this to work, you need to develop and use an action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plan, do, check and act with a Kaizen action plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many practices like the idea of the Kaizen philosophy but do not understand how to implement it. Successful practices often pair the PDCA cycle (plan, do check and act) with the Kaizen philosophy to get results. The two strategies support one another and allow practices to make small, measurable, and sustainable improvements. Also, this strategy involves employees, increasing engagement throughout the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The “Plan” stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kaizen action plan should begin with the “plan” stage. Just as it sounds, practices must plan the strategy before moving to the next step. During the stage, employees identify a problem. For instance, the problem could be something as simple as long wait times. After the problem is determined, the practice must gather data related to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the practice must find a solution to the problem. The solution might be avoiding double-booking patients or changing a policy about seeing late patients. Involved parties need to consider the possible outcomes of implementing the solution, as well as a method for measuring its success. All changes must be measurable for the action plan to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The “do” stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the “do” stage, the practice implements the plan. Someone needs to be in charge of collecting data when implementing the plan. The data should clearly show if the plan helps the practice. All data is carried over to the next stage when the practice determines if the plan is viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The “check” stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team members should analyze the data during the “check” stage to see if the plan worked as expected. Did it generate the anticipated results? Did the plan help the practice? Is the solution practical and helpful instead of disruptive? Practices need to ask these questions to determine how effective the plan was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The “act” stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “act” stage is the last part of the action plan. If the plan worked, the practice needs to announce the change to all employees. It is also essential to add any changes to practice training materials and handbooks. If it did not work, the practice needs to start the process once again. Some changes do not work, but if practices go back to the drawing board, they will find a solution to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make positive changes with Kaizen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kaizen action plan will help you make positive changes for your practice. Train your employees on this strategy and have everyone take part in developing a plan. When you open your practice up to suggestions, you can make important changes that improve satisfaction for employees and patients. This will help you retain employees and patients and allow your practice to generate more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

Utilizing proven tools and resources<a class="moretag" href="/healthcare-recovery-tools-and-resources-provided-by-doctor-genius/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/healthcare-recovery-tools-and-resources-provided-by-doctor-genius/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/healthcare-recovery-tools-and-resources-provided-by-doctor-genius/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2020 13:00:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius assists healthcare practices with methods for new patient acquisition during the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing proven tools and resources to learn more about COVID-19 and how to alter services and marketing strategies is a great way to help your practice survive these trying times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Doctor Genius offers marketing strategies that allow practices to improve digital outreach to prospective patients. We also offer free informational resources to help practices quickly learn more about the COVID-19 pandemic and how it may affect their practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Altering your practice&amp;#8217;s approach for COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has made it more challenging in the healthcare industry. Many practices that primarily offer elective or non-emergency services are finding it more challenging to acquire new patients. Healthcare practices that deal directly with the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 find themselves more vulnerable and must take more precautions when dealing with patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, every practice is affected in one way or another. Thus, practices must temporarily alter their approach to be more accommodating to the needs of patients and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital marketing strategies to recover from COVID-19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to minimize the financial impact COVID-19 has on your practice and recover faster is through implementing digital marketing tools and strategies. Offline marketing such as billboard advertisements, medical conferences, etc. are not as effective because more are staying home for social distancing purposes. However, the use of digital devices is likely to increase. This increase in usage means practices need to alter their methods for reaching patients to help stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius offers digital marketing tools to assist with healthcare recovery. Utilizing strategies such as improving web design in anticipation of more traffic, writing more informative content with content marketing, and using detailed keyword analysis reports to optimize on-page content are great ways to continue marketing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Informational resources for COVID-19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius also offers free informational resources for practices. We cover a range of topics related to the healthcare industry. Most notably, we provide insights and updates centered around digital marketing, practice management, and relevant medical updates. Our digital marketing resources go over how to optimize websites and boost reputation, for example. Practices can also check out our practice management category for resources about dealing with the day-to-day responsibilities that practices face. We also offer our Genius Lab to help you stay informed on noteworthy updates about the healthcare industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for COVID-19, we seek to assist healthcare practices by offering informational resources, particularly content that deals with managing their practice during social distancing and continuing to acquire new patients during the fight to reduce the spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contact Doctor Genius to learn more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the healthcare recovery tools and resources that Doctor Genius offers practices, get in touch with us today. We can help you tailor your digital marketing strategy to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and continue acquiring new patients. This can have a short-term impact to help your practice survive, as well as make your practice more resilient in the long term with an improved marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

This increased risk can make it mentally, physically, and emotionally taxing<a class="moretag" href="/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 13:00:57 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Medical teams are more vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased risk can make it mentally, physically, and emotionally taxing on healthcare workers as they treat patients. Fortunately, there are support resources available to help those who may find their job to be more demanding than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of support for medical teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too often, the health and well-being of medical teams get overlooked during times of crisis. The jobs of medical professionals are far more challenging because they often treat patients who may have contagious conditions such as COVID-19. For many, this causes increased anxiety and distress, which can affect short-term and long-term well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial for medical teams to have support resources available to them, so they can deal with any negative mental, physical, or emotional concerns they have. Many medical workers begin to feel more anxious, experience extreme fatigue, and become more fearful as they treat patients who may have COVID-19. Support resources help them deal with these concerns and be at their healthiest mental and physical state so they can do their jobs to the best of their ability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources for mental, physical and emotional support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many support resources available to medical teams. In addition to seeking assistance from others within the practice, workers can find support from the following resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Psychiatric Association (APA): &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/well-being-and-burnout/well-being-resources&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/well-being-and-burnout/well-being-resources&quot;&gt;The APA&lt;/a&gt; offers well-being resources for healthcare workers who may experience burnout, anxiety, depression, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Medical Association (AMA): &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/managing-mental-health-during-covid-19&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/managing-mental-health-during-covid-19&quot;&gt;The AMA&lt;/a&gt; has special resources designed for medical workers to take care of themselves, as well as insights into how practices can provide assistance for their staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World Health Organization (WHO): Resources such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt; are a great place to learn more about COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Care Toolbox: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthcaretoolbox.org/pediatric-traumatic-stress/14-health-care-toolbox/tools-and-resources.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.healthcaretoolbox.org/pediatric-traumatic-stress/14-health-care-toolbox/tools-and-resources.html&quot;&gt;The Health Care Toolbox &lt;/a&gt;offers resources for medical professionals who deal with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headspace: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; is a unique app that allows medical workers to de-stress after a long day and get a better night&amp;#8217;s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every medical worker should look out for their health and well-being as we fight COVID-19. Practices should also ensure that their staff has all the resources they need to cope mentally and physically during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tips for medical workers on coping with COVID-19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, medical workers should take a moment each day to evaluate their mental and physical state. Putting coping strategies into place, such as eating healthy, staying active, and interacting with loved ones, can help workers deal with the challenge COVID-19 poses. It is essential to communicate with others within your medical team, especially those in a position of leadership if you are feeling mentally or physically overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When it comes to helping a website rank in search results, content is critical. The content on a website can help to bring in potential patients through using keywords, SEO, and posting content regularly. At Doctor Genius, we can provide a steady flow of content to a client’s website, as well as managing the site as a whole. Therefore, as Google has just launched another core update, we are preparing for any changes that may come with its new algorithm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Within this new update, your website may experience changes in search results and the number of people who view your website. Here is what we know about the update and how we are here to help ensure the most effective search results for your practice’s website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What We Know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/googles-may-2020-core-update-was-big-and-broad-search-data-tools-show-334393?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWW1GallqRmxNakZoWkdFdyIsInQiOiIrRWRcL2c0UklNT1orRUZkNnFyUjkwTDhqRzdXQmt0ZHZ1bUl6V2R1dklYSnhiWFJPdHNyZTlMOGo0VnRCRnBGWVNIRkFGOUVXRlZobDlibVRHd0pUN0JMaWtwczd4UlgrTTY0MGNGaVBZazczZDh1eDR3bTJETVdrMWlyY2tQZTIifQ%3D%3D&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Search Engine Land&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, this update went into effect on May 4th, 2020, and is one of the largest the internet has seen in a while. Core updates, as opposed to daily updates, tend to happen every few months and are not meant to be a method of restricting or limiting web traffic to certain pages. However, it can be challenging to completely map out what the changes are with the update and how they will affect your website. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It usually takes a few months before data analysts can determine the full effects of a core update. However, internal trends are usually reported within a few weeks. At this moment, Doctor Genius’ client base shows positive results for online traffic following the core update. Since the update began, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;our clients have seen more than a 20%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; increase&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; in organic page views and organic sessions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. In other words, the recent uptick in our client’s online performance is likely due to Google’s May algorithm change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How This May Effect Your Practice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/08/core-updates.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Google Webmaster Central Blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; explains that the core update involves changes that “are about improving how our systems assess content overall,” further stating that “These changes may cause some pages that were previously under-rewarded to do better.” However, it can also cause certain pages to not receive as much traffic. In these instances, it helps to have a team that can further assess the situation and adapt to any changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What You Can Do to Stay Ahead of Algorithm Changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When it comes to staying ahead of these Google algorithm changes, there are several possible steps one can take. The main area of focus should always be on the quality of content. While keywords can help certain pages rank in search results, the algorithm continues to change to better track spam or other pages that do not deliver quality content. Semrush.com quotes Google in saying that these &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semrush.com/blog/google-may-2020-core-update/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;core updates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; are “designed to ensure that overall, we’re delivering on our mission to present relevant and authoritative content to searchers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We can help create original content for your website with the purpose to both express the message you want to send and help target patient needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our marketing and production teams are constantly reviewing content and help send the right message for each client. As we anticipate Google’s algorithm to constantly be updated to reward quality content, we work proactively to update our client’s pages with the information on the latest technology and answers to the new consumer needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We also work to improve on how we structure content to meet the needs of more users’ queries. In congruence with what experts say about SEO best practices, we constantly provide client&amp;#8217;s new material because Google’s search values unique content. All of our efforts also adhere to the quality factors stated in Google’s Central Webmaster Blog:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Providing original information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Containing a complete and comprehensive description of the topic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ensuring the title or headline of pages is descriptive of the topic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Using the proper resources and citations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Helping deliver a personalized and unique message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Groups Who Were Most Affected by Search &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One of the major questions people have with each update is who benefits from this and who is taking a hit in the number of page views. Semrush.com explains that “the most influenced categories are Travel, Real Estate, Health, Pets &amp;amp; Animals, and People &amp;amp; Society.” Commonly known as the winners and losers of the update, it seems that websites focusing on news, business and industrial, online communication, and health experienced their own levels of increase in views.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Semrush.com further explains that the entertainment websites promoting offline entertainment took the biggest hit and are on the losing side of the update. Since more people are remaining inside and most businesses have restrictions, it can be difficult to offer specific services. Medical practices are also experiencing limitations due to quarantine. However, an outcome of Covid-19 has been google favoring medical providers who offer virtual consultations. Additionally, we have personally seen an uptick in demand for dental services during the first months of the pandemic, as mentioned in our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;blueprint to recovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At Doctor Genius, we can help to adapt and tailor the content of your website to reflect both your practice services and the content that will attract more views. Especially following the COVID-19 pandemic and the quarantine regulations across the world, it is crucial for medical practices to have an effective online platform for reaching potential and current patients. For a website to help do this, there needs to be a regular flow of content to display activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Reach Patients with Your Message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We will take the time to understand your needs and desire for how you want to present your website to patients. Along with customization, we can help to maintain your website, social media, patient retention, and more with various packages to choose from.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Is a Google Core Update?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Google core update is an update to Google’s search algorithm. These changes are focused on helping enhance how Google measures the content of a page to determine where it ends up in search results lists. This update can have a positive or negative effect on search results for certain types of services and fields in the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Often Does Google Release Core Updates? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In most cases, the update can be every few months. The last update was in January of 2020. This update seems to be the largest update in a while as sources determine that it took around two weeks to finish updating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is E-A-T? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;E-A-T stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. This acronym applies to page quality for webpages, blogs, and articles posted online. This acronym covers the three areas of focus for determining if the content will meet the guidelines of the algorithm update. Doctor Genius can help clients to stay on top of these updates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the Difference Between a Google Core Update and Regular Updates?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While Google Core Updates only happen several times a year, there are much smaller updates and tweaks at least once per day. These routine updates can affect ranking but tend to only have a marginal effect on search results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Although remote work is already somewhat common in many industries, many companies were not ready for the unexpected transition into an entirely remote workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping work teams engaged and motivated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not enough to have the proper tech tools to keep the remote team working, but leadership also needs a strategy for maintaining efficient and motivated teams. Almost all families are now quarantined together in their houses, so employees have to deal with more distractions than usual. Also, they may be anxious about their safety and wellbeing, so employers need to pay attention to how their fears may affect productivity in the following weeks and months. To ensure smooth operations as the company navigates the “new normal,” below are expert insights on how to maintain engagement and motivation as the team works from home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communication is important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fully remote team needs regular, clear communication to succeed. It is particularly crucial as the COVID-19 situation unfolds. Business owners need to devise different methods to communicate with their employees, including emails and chat software. Carefully prepared presentations can keep them going and provide necessary updates that affect the business at large. Chat channels are an efficient way to handle communication that once took place ad hoc, while video software can take the place of formal meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Videos work too&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts are easy-to-use video conferencing tools that ensure a regular meeting schedule. The key is to encourage every team member to switch on their cameras for face-to-face and necessary social interaction. Weekly meetings over video conferencing can keep everyone connected and prepared for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exemplary leadership with proper remote work setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the team is not familiar with working from home, they may need time to adjust to their new home workspace. As the leader, having a proper remote work setup can serve as the model for the team, especially during video conferences. The work setup should be free of clutters and face a window for natural light. Noise-canceling headphones can help maintain focus on the necessary tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoid micromanaging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders might be tempted to monitor their employees constantly to ensure that they are staying on task as they work from home. However, micromanaging the team does not inspire trust, and a culture that revolves around trust is essential when keeping remote workers engaged and motivated. Since most of the work is now done remotely, leaders can achieve trust by avoiding micromanagement and staying transparent. Workers should be able to work autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Friendly interactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time often passes by quickly at home, and employees, removed from the social cues in the office, might be working without breaks. Managers can plan virtual breaks with team members between meetings to praise their accomplishments and foster healthy casual talk. Studies show, workers often perform better when they have a leader who cares about their wellbeing and creates time for fun and teambuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are challenging times, and employees are still trying to adjust to the COVID-19 crisis and their work. You can do your best as the business owner or manager to keep them motivated and engaged during the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

Social distancing, however, does not mean that practices must close their doors entirely or discontinue marketing efforts. There are ways to stay in business during the COVID-19 pandemic and continue acquiring new patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of social distancing during COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As difficult as it might be for many practices, social distancing is an essential part of getting things back to normal. Ultimately, social distancing for COVID-19 is the best thing for practices because it may prevent the spread of the virus. This not only protects patients, but it also protects staff at your practice from exposure to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, the pandemic does not mean your business has to discontinue all services and marketing efforts, but rather transition into a new way of treating patients and reaching those in need of your services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to expect during social distancing for COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has already caused many practices to only offer necessary or emergency services. This change makes it more challenging for all types of practices, especially those who primarily offer services not considered an emergency. Perhaps more notably, the pandemic has made healthcare and dental workers more vulnerable. Thus staff is required to take more precautions when dealing with patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ways to stay in business while social distancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some practices that do not offer emergency services have closed their doors during the pandemic, others have altered the way they operate. With a little creativity, practices can continue helping their patients and find new ways to reach out to prospective patients nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Offer emergency services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many states have requested that medical and dental practices put a halt on most elective procedures but allow for emergency services and procedures that are necessary to continue. While social distancing may limit the services that your practice can offer, transitioning your marketing approach to target prospective patients who need essential and emergency services is a great way to continue acquiring new patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Put in place virtual visits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While virtual visits are not an option for all practices, many can stay in touch with their patients through virtual visits. These allow practices to discuss symptoms with the patient and help them determine if their need is considered an emergency. Staying in touch is not only a great way to treat the needs of patients while respecting social distancing, but it also helps ensure that the practice can keep their patients in the long term, after COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continue new patient acquisition with digital marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practices can continue acquiring new patients while social distancing by altering the way they market. More people are using digital devices while they are at home social distancing, which makes for a great opportunity to increase digital marketing efforts.

Dentists have a high<a class="moretag" href="/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 13:00:35 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 global pandemic has affected many industries all over the world, including the dental industry. Dentists have a high risk of being infected due to their proximity to their patients while performing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How COVID-19 is changing the dental market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak of the coronavirus has left many business owners wondering how they will take care of their expenses. Dental clinics fall under this umbrella because many are small businesses run by a single owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/infectious-diseases-2019-novel-coronavirus?utm_source=adaorg&amp;amp;utm_medium=VanityURL&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/infectious-diseases-2019-novel-coronavirus?utm_source=adaorg&amp;amp;utm_medium=VanityURL&quot;&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt; has recommended that dentists only offer emergency services to their patients as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow. Many dentists are following the recommendations of the ADA and cutting back on their hours of operation. Some clinics are even shutting down completely in the midst of all of the uncertainty. Dental clinics are also highly impacted by the scarcity of essential items like face masks, which help protect dentists and their patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentists will have to look for creative ways to help their patients and keep their businesses running while trying to practice social distancing. Some dentists are now using their websites and phone lines to help their patients. Patients are screened over the phone to understand the nature of their problem, and the dentist can give them advice on how to proceed. Patients with issues that require emergency dental treatment are asked to come to the clinic. Screening patients helps limit the number of people at the clinic at any given time, which makes it a safer environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of providing emergency dental treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentists have a responsibility to treat patients with dental emergencies because failing to do so would leave emergency rooms — many of which are already at their max capacities due to the pandemic — with an additional burden to take care of. The White House agrees with the ADA&amp;#8217;s recommendations in terms of advising the population to delay elective dental or medical treatments while COVID-19 remains an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Increasing hygiene practices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentists also have a responsibility to protect themselves and their patients during this outbreak. Social distancing should be practiced in waiting rooms with patients sitting six feet apart from each other. This should be easier to manage if only patients with dental emergencies are allowed in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tele-dentistry companies will likely emerge as winners during this pandemic because people with non-essential dental needs are now more likely than ever to try such services. Brick-and-mortar dentist offices should also start developing ways to perform non-essential treatments without a need for patients to come to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Help is available for the dental industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has passed a $2-trillion stimulus that aims to provide some relief to businesses that have been hit hard by the coronavirus. Programs that dental clinics qualify for include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL): These loans are being provided on a first-come, first-serve basis. It provides an emergency grant of up to $10,000 that must be used to pay overhead expenses, employee wages, or rent/mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paycheck Protection program: This can give small businesses up to 2.5 times their monthly payroll to keep them afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

As the numbers grow and more areas go into lockdown, its impact on businesses is profound and unprecedented by anything we have seen in recent times. As governments take drastic measures in response to coronavirus, practices also need to adjust quickly to navigate the financial and operational difficulties that accompany the pandemic. This article contains insights from experts on how to scale your business during COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scaling your Business during COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are ways that practice owners can scale their establishments during the pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Provide flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stores, businesses, schools, and commercial centers around the country are shutting down operations. As the country approaches total lockdown, business owners need to give their employees more flexibility with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools available to business owners to ensure efficient communication with their employers. This will allow everyone to stay in touch and keep working even if they are not in the office. There should be a policy in place regarding work policy, like when team members need to be online and available, a medium of communication (like Slack, Google Hangouts, or WhatsApp) and the deliverables for each team member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enable direct communications with customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This crisis affects everyone, so it is better to be completely open about what the business is experiencing. Customers will understand the challenges that the brand is facing if they receive regular updates. When customers no longer have access to the details about the efforts done behind the scenes to get routine services, their appreciation for the service reduces, and they begin to value it less. Business owners need to explain the measures they are taking to curb risks and provide insights into the steps they are taking regarding community service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shift your sales tactics online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When physical locations are no longer an option, savvy business owners need to consider leveraging online platforms to curb heavy losses. Digital platforms enable interactions with customers and boost online sales. This could significantly increase the company’s sales. Businesses can keep your employees engaged and earning by selling on social media and websites, using email lists, and generating new leads with the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capitalize on the brand’s value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands add value to their customers, and the products or services that are beneficial during the crisis deserve the consideration of those who need them. If what the practice does supports or eases people’s lives during the lockdown, business owners need to capitalize on that and tell the brand’s story. As long as the practice focuses on delivering value, marketing and sales will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make necessary evaluations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep the practice running throughout the coronavirus pandemic, owners need to make critical evaluations of what matters more to the company’s survival. This includes evaluating the supply chain for vulnerabilities and identifying teams and workers that ensure essential operations or services keep running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Importance of staying resilient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to tell when the COVID-19 pandemic will end. However, business owners can scale their businesses and stay on top of the situation by staying proactive and taking necessary measures. It is in times like this that the strength of the practice is put to the test, and those who adapt survice.&lt;/p&gt;

An optimistic mindset would suit you better, though. Research shows that having a positive mindset helps strengthen your immune system, your body&amp;#8217;s first line of defense against the COVID-19 virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping a positive mindset during COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html&quot;&gt;stress sources, like tension at work or marital spats, can promote diseases and hinder recovery&lt;/a&gt;. Here are simple things you can do to keep your stress levels at a minimum during these uncertain times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Establishing a work-life balance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a good balance between the time you spend working and the time spent doing things that refresh you (like spending time with family) is one of those things that most busy people struggle with, particularly business owners. With most of the country under some form of quarantine. People now have more time to spend with their loved ones and improve their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is best to be proactive about your work-life balance. Plan our your daily schedule ahead of time and include activities with the family, like helping the kids with their remote learning. While people cannot wait for this pandemic to be over with, they can use this time to establish a work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Lower your operating costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business owners have to adapt to COVID-19 by taking advantage of tools like video phone conferencing, since meeting face to face is currently not an option for many. The good thing is that it will reduce your operating costs and can show you new ways to make your business more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing and sustaining a business remotely is a huge challenge, but many business owners are doing exactly that. It will also save you money in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Capitalize on new opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is causing disruptions to our lives in ways we have never seen before. Time-tested systems that have been used for manufacturing, studying, working, and living are being destroyed all around us. Without a doubt, some businesses will be forced to close, but it also creates massive opportunities in many industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is now trying to figure out better ways to learn, work, live, and run businesses. Those who come up with solutions to the problems created by the coronavirus will have success. For example, some dental clinics are now using video conferencing tools to diagnose patients, educate them on how to deal with their issues, and determine if they need to come to the clinic for emergency dental work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t stress over problems created by COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, find solutions to these problems, and your business will emerge better than it was before the pandemic started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the COVID-19 pandemic continues through the nation and countries around the world, certain restrictions and regulations across the U.S. will gradually begin to end. With this in mind, dental practices are wondering how to proceed in a post-COVID-19 world. Our team at Doctor Genius is here to help practices go over what they will need to help reach patients and go over the new process for dental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, more than ever, it is crucial for practices to send out the right message to patients. Doctor Genius can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Following the Latest State Mandates and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since each state has different mandates for dental practices and quarantine regulations, it is essential for dental practices to remain on top of it. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/covid-19-state-mandates-and-recommendations?utm_source=cpsorg&amp;amp;utm_medium=covid-cps-virus-lp&amp;amp;utm_content=state-mandates&amp;amp;utm_campaign=covid-19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ADA Center for Professional Success&amp;#x2122;&lt;/a&gt; is keeping track of each state and what is allowed when it comes to dental services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since each state is unique, there are a variety of changes and steps that dental practices will need to take. Along with that, we can help go over how to express these changes to patients in a positive way. We can offer you support during these challenging times, which will still have an impact on society well after the quarantine is lifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This only increases the notion that practices need to have a plan for re-opening. A recent Doctor Genius Webinar covers the details about developing a plan for dental practices known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius-1.wistia.com/medias/5yv90rvx3c&quot; target=&quot; _blank&quot;&gt;Practice Recovery Blueprint&lt;/a&gt;. Along with helping to set up a plan, we can help you capture the message your practice sends to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Your Message to Patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While having an active website with constantly updating content relevant to your practice is important, there are new questions that patients will have in a post-COVID-19 world. These questions can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;browser-default&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What are the new hours?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Can I schedule an appointment this week?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What constitutes a dental emergency?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Should I try to put my tooth back in if it falls out?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do I need to wear a facemask in the lobby?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If my child is receiving dental care, can I wait in the lobby?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are only a few of the possible questions patients may have. At Doctor Genius, we understand this is a stressful time for dentists and patients alike. Thus, it is the perfect time to talk with us about developing a message and content to reach out to your community. Patients will be looking for advice on scheduling, sudden oral health issues, oral hygiene, and follow-up care. We can help provide content that uses SEO keywords pertaining to your practice along with any guidelines or information you need patients to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius will strive to help equip you with the tools, content, and platform necessary to become a source of information for the current and potential patients within your community.

Washing your hands might help you keep the virus away, but it will not bring more customers to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping your business moving forward during COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will go over tactics you can use to keep your business above water as you navigate around the uncertainty created by the coronavirus. Here are simple ways to positively impact your business and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Use automated lead processes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business owners should already have automated lead generation systems in place. If your business does not already have one, now is a good time to start. Such systems can easily help you double your sales and bring in extra revenue that might help keep the doors of your business open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses without automated ways to generate leads are essentially running up a hill. They often end up spending more money to generate fewer leads. Automating the process allows business owners to sell their products and services even when the business is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Streamline systems and use fewer workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is typically easier to manage a system than it is to manage individuals. People tend to become more unreliable during stressful times, and having a system in place makes it easier to determine which employees are contributing the most. It also allows them to work more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Provide safeguards for customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so much uncertainty going around, providing safeguards for customers will make them more likely to purchase your business&amp;#8217;s products and services. Let customers know how your business is adapting to the coronavirus and what will happen if you are not able to fulfill your end of the contract due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how potential customers have been affected by the coronavirus can also help increase your sales. For example, providing payment plans can be helpful when dealing with customers whose income has been limited by COVID-19. Surveys are a great way to get into the minds of potential customers and understand their concerns. The business can then implement safeguards that address these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Use high-quality copy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People being quarantined due to the coronavirus means that they are spending more time online. Having a website or web marketing system gives business owners a huge competitive advantage right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing tactics like search engine optimization will bring traffic to a business, but that is only half the battle. Engaging copy on your website is what builds trust with the person and prompts them to make a purchase. It involves placing relevant content at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the quantity of content on a website over quality rarely ever works out for the business. People will not trust your business if you have poorly written content on your site, and you will not generate much revenue with weak sales pitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take advantage of new opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 brings its share of challenges, but it also brings many opportunities that smart business owners can take advantage of for their benefit.

The global pandemic continues to claim<a class="moretag" href="/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 13:00:23 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Running a business has never been easy, and COVID-19 is making things more complicated. The global pandemic continues to claim more lives as each day passes, and it has disrupted manufacturing and businesses in ways we have never seen before. Many businesses have been slowed down to a halt, while others have to reduce their hours of operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, this pandemic will bring significant changes to our lives, as it proves how unprepared the world is for such events. COVID-19 brings the apocalypse for many businesses, but others will be able to use the disruption to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marketing in a world with COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the right ways to market a business might seem like rocket science. Still, the fundamentals of digital marketing can help your business make it through the current economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Here are simple things you can do to ensure that people can find your business online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Social media marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is where billions of people all over the globe connect on online platforms. Social media marketing might seem intimidating if it is not something you use personally, but many of these platforms are easy to figure out. If you are one of those people who have a hard time navigating the internet, take online classes to familiarize yourself with the social media platform you plan to use or hire a social media manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of social media as a place you can share your thoughts, products, and services. Consistently post information that provides value, and your following will grow. A huge following allows you to send information about your business to a large number of people in a matter of seconds. You can also use direct messages to market products and services or network with other business owners who might have helpful information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Create videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video marketing is another great way to market your business. Business owners can do this by making video tutorials targeting keywords relevant to their business. For example, a dentist who runs their practice can create step-by-step tutorials on the proper way to floss. People looking to improve their flossing technique enter keywords into a search engine. The tutorial created by the dentist pops up, and the patient gets the information they need from a credible source. YouTube is a great place to start with marketing videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Create a blog with a focus on search engine optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web-blog also helps you reach a wider audience. Many business owners are hesitant to start one because they feel that the many other pages online will drown theirs out, but that only happens when you do not include search engine optimization as part of your marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good SEO strategy allows you to drive organic traffic to your blog. There are no limits to how much traffic a business can bring in using SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The fundamentals will get you past COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick to the fundaments of digital marketing, and your business will be more likely to survive the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Call or email Doctor Genius to learn more about how we can help you to keep your business running while the world deals with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

You understand the importance of social<a class="moretag" href="/how-do-i-reschedule-all-my-appointments/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-do-i-reschedule-all-my-appointments/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-do-i-reschedule-all-my-appointments/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 13:00:33 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You know that you should postpone elective and preventive care during the COVID-19 crisis. You understand the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve. Still, you worry about finances. You need a full schedule to generate revenue, so rescheduling your appointments is critical. Here are a few rescheduling tips to help your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips for rescheduling appointments during COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication is key to filling waiting rooms once the crisis is over. Health care providers know that shelter-in-place orders could continue for months. Some even expect it could last until 2021 when a possible vaccine may finally be ready. Providers should connect with patients, so they understand what to expect during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this call will help ensure patients return for the rescheduled appointment. The provider can answer any questions patients may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prioritize based on the needs of the patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care providers should prioritize patients when rescheduling appointments. Patients who are at the highest risk should get priority when rescheduling. Providers should stay in frequent contact with these patients, providing updates on when it will be possible to see them again. Maintaining contact shows the patients that their health is a priority for the practice. This provides an incentive to reschedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make rescheduling easy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before COVID-19, most patients prefer scheduling appointments online. Practices can expect to see a spike in rescheduled appointments with online scheduling. The fear of the unknown makes it difficult for patients to know when it is okay to go to a provider. By providing online scheduling, patients can fill those slots when they feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also lessens the burden on the staff. Staff members are already bogged down with phone calls. Allowing patients to reschedule online allows members to talk to those who need it most. This takes the stress off the staff members’ shoulders. It also makes it easier to keep a full schedule. Patients, employees, and business owners win with this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consider telehealth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telehealth and teledentistry have come into vogue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology allows providers to manage basic conditions and offer preventative care. These appointments tend to take less time for both the patient and the provider and are more affordable. They can also take place over the computer or phone. This form of appointment limits in-person visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible, providers should rely on telehealth to manage some of the burdens. Filling the schedule with telehealth appointments makes it easier to meet the demands of the patients. Providers who use this can begin seeing patients now. These providers do not have to wait until the crisis is over. Also, providers can maintain appointments with telehealth even after the pandemic comes to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep the books full during and after the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is normal to feel worried about the state of your practice during a pandemic. Canceled appointments hurt your bottom line. You need to reschedule those missed opportunities. Fortunately, you can fill your schedule. Communicate with your patients, give priority to those who are at the highest risk, and make it easy for people to reschedule. Also, you can rely on telehealth so you can catch up on rescheduled appointments quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

Practices across the country have reduced the hours or shut their doors completely, leaving providers wondering what to do when the pandemic is over. What steps need to be taken to jump back in and see patients again? While it might seem impossible to hit the ground running, you can do just that with a little preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steps to keep schedules full after the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could take months or even a year before life is back to normal. When that happens, patients will be ready to go to local practices. Practices that take the steps necessary to get up and to run quickly will enjoy an influx of patients. Many will even have stronger practices than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get financial help&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some practices are closed, others are still open but offer fewer services. In both cases, practices have fewer financial resources available. It is hard to get up and running without any capital, so practices are encouraged to use the available financial resources to put cash into the business. The federal government is currently offering a Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, including medical and dental practices, keep employees on the payroll. Keeping employees on the payroll will make it easier to run on all cylinders when the pandemic is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government is offering other financial options for practices that have taken a financial hit during the COVID-19 pandemic. These options include loan advances, bridge loans, and debt relief. Practices can use these resources to stay financially healthy during the pandemic. Then, when the pandemic is under control, practices will be ready to get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expand hours when reopening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a massive demand for health care providers and dentists when Americans are no longer required to engage in social distancing. Practices are encouraged to expand their hours to meet the demand. Those who do this are more likely to get a larger portion of the patients. If possible, practices should also consider working on weekends until the demand begins to die down. This can help practices generate revenue in the first several months after the pandemic ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Broadcast sterilization techniques&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aftermath of the pandemic will likely include psychological changes. Americans will be more fearful of germs and viruses. Practices that want to attract patients will need to make sterilization strategies part of their business models. Simply cleaning more often is not enough. Practices need to communicate what they are doing to the patients. Those who go the extra mile are more likely to generate business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get ready to restart your practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has changed the way you do business. It might seem like there is no end in sight, but eventually, the pandemic will be contained, and you will go back to business as normal. For that to happen, however, you need to take steps to prepare. Get the financial help you need during the pandemic. Then, consider expanding your hours and adopt sterilization techniques so your patients will not worry about getting sick. Then, you can treat patients like you did before COVID-19 took over.&lt;/p&gt;

While this concept works in all areas of business and<a class="moretag" href="/how-to-implement-kaizen-strategies-to-inspire-teams/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-implement-kaizen-strategies-to-inspire-teams/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-implement-kaizen-strategies-to-inspire-teams/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 13:00:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kaizen is a Japanese concept that refers to continuous improvement. While this concept works in all areas of business and personal growth, many medical and dental practices have particularly enjoyed success using Kaizen. The key is to implement strategies that inspire teams. When everyone is inspired and involved, those small improvements add up and create a healthy practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kaizen strategies to inspire teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees should be at the heart of a practice’s Kaizen strategy. This goes beyond the top of the chain employees. Everyone, including janitors and support staff, is needed for this strategy to work. Once everyone is involved, employees will feel inspired. To ensure inspiration, employers must train employees, empower them, and measure the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Train employees on Kaizen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before a practice can implement Kaizen strategies, it must ensure that employees fully understand it. All employees must receive training on Kaizen. The strategies are simple and include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Improvements with small, incremental changes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The ideas come from the employees&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Feedback for all changes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The results are measurable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practices should train all current employees. Also, new employees should be trained on Kaizen when hired. Once everyone is on the same page, it is time to implement the strategies. Then, the practice can make small improvements and inspire employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Empower employees and teams&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly inspire, practices must empower employees. All employees should be encouraged to share ideas to improve their positions. Employees give suggestions to supervisors, who then empower them to implement the change immediately. This gives employees the freedom to make meaningful changes in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practices should also encourage teams to work together to brainstorm ideas for changes. When working in teams, it is common to have several solutions. The team should select one of the ideas and start with it. Then, if that idea does not provide the desired results, the team can try a different idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Measure the results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaizen works because it is measurable. Supervisors must measure the outcome after the changes are implemented. After the results are tracked, the employee meets with the supervisor to go over the results. If both agree that the results showed a positive outcome, the new practice can be standardized and enforced. It will continue to be the standard mode of practice until someone else comes up with a new way to improve the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees cannot help but feel inspired after their ideas become standard practice. These employees are making a difference on the practice. That causes employees to work hard to come up with additional ideas as well. It is exciting to have a role in changing a practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grow your practice with Kaizen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant changes are challenging to implement and often do not provide the results you need for your practice. With Kaizen, you can use small changes to transform your practice. You might not notice huge changes overnight, but after using Kaizen for a few months, you will start to see significant results. Possibly, more importantly, your employees will be inspired and take ownership of their positions. Use these tips to implement strategies that get your employees excited to contribute at work.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether some practices continue to provide some emergency services during the quarantine or had to close their doors, there are various factors that they will need to know before reopening fully. Thus Doctor Genius is working with NextLevel Practice CEO Gary Kadi to introduce the Practice Recovery Blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solution You Need in One Place&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter the third month in quarantine, state governments are laying out plans to allow more businesses to reopen with modest new operational guidelines. Professional medical practices of all professions are attempting to determine the next steps for reopening. In a recent webinar session in the series &amp;#8220;Certainty in an Uncertain World,&amp;#8221; Doctor Genius&amp;#8217;s Vice President Phil Lopez and Gary Kadi, join others in breaking down what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius-1.wistia.com/medias/5yv90rvx3c&quot; target=&quot; _blank&quot;&gt;Practice Recovery Blueprint&lt;/a&gt; includes for medical professionals and why it is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the appointment, Phil Lopez and Gary Kadi, list off questions and factors that dentists and other medical professionals need to focus on. Lopez elaborates on the partnership with NextLevel Practice to create &amp;#8220;…an all-inclusive solution that meets the needs of your practice,&amp;#8221; also highlighting that &amp;#8220;Our partnership provides the resources that improve your organization&amp;#8217;s operations and empower teams to create a one-of-a-kind experience for patients.&amp;#8221; This partnership can help our clients determine what they will need to reopen and provide the quality services patients need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Following the Search Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we are constantly monitoring the search results of our content to determine what services patients are searching for. While there was a dip in search results during the earlier weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now seeing an increase in specific search terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual change in organic traffic growth for dental practices since stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns, went into effect is represented in the graph below. Organic traffic growth is defined as the growth of visitors who found a website through search inquires alone. As can be seen from the graph below, the number of searches by users is growing each week. When we cross-compared these numbers to yearly averages for late March and all of April for other years, we found this growth in visitors to be atypical. In other words, the data is showing that patients have a growing demand to seek out dentists during the COVID-19 crisis. Numerically, there are about 7% more patients visiting dental sites each week from organic search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2140&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Growth in Organic Traffic Since Lockdown for Dental&quot; width=&quot;549&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3.png 549w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3-300x166.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3-177x98.png 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common search terms we see include &amp;#8220;dentist near me,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;emergency dentist,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;teledentistry,&amp;#8221; and other questions such as &amp;#8220;Can you put a tooth back in your mouth?,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Is a tooth abscess considered a dental emergency?,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;What do you do with a toothache on the weekends?&amp;#8221; to name a few. People are currently in need of treatment and will be once the quarantine lifts. While at this moment, most online inquires show spikes in emergency care needs, we’re also seeing new searches. To prepare for what searches may be relevant going into June and beyond, you may read further into &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/&quot;&gt;our article on changing habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental practices need to be prepared to provide all of the services patients need. Many of the practices we serve are reporting an increase in customer activity as patients want to put this stall in their work-lives toward staying healthy. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://recoverygenius.nextlevelpractice.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Practice Recovery Blueprint&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about how to prepare and reopen with a strong foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to providing dentistry in a post-COVID world, dentists will need to consider various factors for providing treatment. Doctor Genius and NextLevel Practice can help dentists find the solutions they need by considering several factors such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;browser-default&quot;&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Frequency of scheduling appointments&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Language and message front desk staff members use when communicating with patients over the phone&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anticipating specific services online that patients need&lt;/li&gt;

However, the financial impact of the pandemic can be limited through a more refined marketing approach. The daily life of prospective patients has temporarily changed, and they are spending more time online and using digital devices more often. As the way patients operate daily has changed, the marketing strategies of practices should also adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many healthcare and dental practices are turning toward online marketing strategies to weather the storm during COVID-19, and the effort to focus on digital marketing may lead to an increase in long-term revenue and more resilience if a future pandemic occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limit the COVID-19 impact on patient acquisition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offline marketing strategies that many practices rely upon are simply not effective during the pandemic. Billboard ads are not being seen often, as our nation pushes for a strong effort of social distancing and staying home. Word-of-mouth patient acquisitions are also dissipating, with public gatherings and workplaces canceling until further notice, which limits social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital marketing, however, is far less affected by COVID-19 as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/31/americans-turn-to-technology-during-covid-19-outbreak-say-an-outage-would-be-a-problem/&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/31/americans-turn-to-technology-during-covid-19-outbreak-say-an-outage-would-be-a-problem/&quot;&gt;the use of digital devices increases&lt;/a&gt;. There are many ways that practices can strengthen their online presence during the COVID-19 crisis. Notably, cleaning up and improving your practice’s website, increasing content production to reach more prospective patients, and utilizing targeted digital advertisements can all be effective during these trying times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital marketing can have a long-lasting impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many practices and businesses alike are increasing efforts in digital marketing to make it through the pandemic, as the benefits may lead to long-term gain. Digital marketing is a reliable strategy for patient acquisition that does not only have to be utilized during times of crisis. Some practices that only did just enough in the past to get by with their online presence are now turning toward digital marketing as a way to increase revenue. Establishing a solid digital marketing platform can make businesses stronger for years to come by providing them with another reliable channel for patient acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protect your practice from any future pandemics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ideally, we will not see another pandemic for more than a century, the reality is that businesses must prepare for unpredictable scenarios. From natural disasters to public health crises, many unforeseen events can occur. Practices that properly prepare by broadening their outreach are often more resilient. The potential to grow your business through an increase in the patient acquisition, along with the ability to reduce the negative financial impact when people are forced to travel less, enhances the ability of a practice to make it through the other side stronger than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Find out more about digital marketing strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temporary effects of COVID-19 put practices in a unique and undesirable situation. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Those who grow their digital marketing efforts during these trying times can be in a better position to weather the storm and become stronger than ever when the dust settles. Doctor Genius offers a range of digital marketing strategies. Get in touch with us today to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether you are providing emergency services or are<a class="moretag" href="/good-office-sanitation-practices/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/good-office-sanitation-practices/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/good-office-sanitation-practices/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 13:00:16 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Preventing the spread of COVID-19 is critical for medical and dental offices. Whether you are providing emergency services or are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, sanitation should be a top priority. Due to the highly contagious nature of this virus, you need to take extra steps to keep germs at bay. Along with keeping your office clean, these sanitation practices will also help your patients relax when they visit your office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to keep offices clean during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offices must start by gathering the proper cleaning supplies. That includes supplies for the people doing the cleaning, as well as any supplies the office team needs. Those who take on the cleaning duties should use a mask, gown, and gloves to protect themselves from the virus. These items should be thrown away after cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning supplies include a soap and water solution or detergent. Offices should also use EPA-approved disinfectant to remove the virus from surfaces. Commercial disinfectants can help to clean both porous and nonporous surfaces. Employees must follow the instructions on the disinfectant to optimize the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clean nonporous surfaces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After putting on the necessary PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), staff members should use a soap and water solution or detergent to clean nonporous surfaces. This removes COVID-19 particles when present, making the disinfectant more effective. After cleaning the surfaces, staff members should use a disinfectant. Then, the team needs to remove the equipment before employees wash their hands for a minimum of 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clean often-forgotten places&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most offices do a good job of cleaning the obvious spots, many employees forget certain germ-prone areas. If left alone, these spots could become a breeding ground for germs. Fortunately, this is avoided by adding often-forgotten items to the daily cleaning list. Employees must clean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Phones&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Doorknobs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Printers and copy machines&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Walls&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Picture frames&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Toilet flushers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Light switches&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Floor baseboards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how often these items are touched, they might need to be cleaned several times a day or once a day. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people cannot overclean the office. Employers should consider a cleaning schedule for employees to follow. Also, employees should clean any items that have been touched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep hand sanitizers available for public use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanitation goes beyond cleaning and disinfecting the office. Employers should keep hand sanitizers throughout the office for public use, including a sanitizer by the reception desk and the seating area. Sanitizers should also be in treatment rooms for patients to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use masks when social distancing is not possible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how clean an office is, it is still possible to spread COVID-19. Social distancing measures require that people stay at least six feet apart, but that is not always possible in a medical or dental office. Staff should use masks when social distancing is impossible. This will protect patients who encounter the staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a sanitation plan to fight COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 spreads quickly, and good sanitation is one of the top ways to fight it. While you cannot completely prevent the spread of COVID-19, you can do your part by keeping your office sanitized. Also, make sure your employees and patients have access to hand sanitizer and PPE if needed. This is a stressful time for many providers, but sanitizing your office is a good way to protect yourself, your staff, and your patients.&lt;/p&gt;

These clinics are screening and testing<a class="moretag" href="/what-does-covid-19-look-like-for-urgent-cares/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-does-covid-19-look-like-for-urgent-cares/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-does-covid-19-look-like-for-urgent-cares/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 13:00:51 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Urgent care centers around the country are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. These clinics are screening and testing patients. The offices also refer them to emergency rooms when necessary. The pandemic has forced urgent care facilities to change the way they operate for the time being. Steps are being taken to protect employees and patients during this difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urgent care on the frontlines of COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgent care facilities currently have two main objectives for COVID-19. First, the facilities want to limit the spread of this highly contagious disease. Second, the facilities want to ensure that sick patients receive the necessary treatment. To accomplish both objectives, offices have changed business models for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Telehealth screenings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgent care facilities realize that reducing the number of patients in waiting rooms is vital. Having fewer people in waiting rooms slows the spread of the disease. Many urgent care offices use online screening and telehealth to determine if people are likely to have coronavirus. Those who do not pass the screening might have to go to a testing facility instead of the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Limiting the time in waiting rooms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many urgent care offices are also allowing patients to wait in vehicles in the parking lot after checking in. Also, many are offering curbside service. These practices reduce the time spent in the waiting room. The methods protect patients and providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Providing masks when necessary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some urgent care facilities provide protective masks for patients. Patients can call ahead before going to the appointment. The screening takes place during the call. Then, a staff member meets the patient at the door and provides the mask if needed. As an added precaution, these facilities also wipe down the door handles and everything else the patient touches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ruling out other conditions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgent care centers are also playing a vital role in providing flu tests for patients. Many people who think they have coronavirus have seasonal flu. After consulting with the provider, patients can come in for the flu test. If the flu test comes back negative, the facility might recommend a coronavirus test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dealing with overflow patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has overwhelmed medical facilities. Some states allow retired providers to join the fight against the disease. These providers do not need to undergo the recertification process. This puts them on the frontlines now. Hospitals need this to meet current patient demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgent care facilities help overwhelmed hospitals by providing other types of care. For example, patients with urinary tract infections or animal bites can visit the urgent care facility. This takes the strain from the overburdened hospitals. It also makes it easier for hospitals to care for COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urgent care facilities are part of the team fighting COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgent care facilities always play an important role in health care. That role is on the frontlines during the COVID-19 crisis. Many facilities have changed business practices for the time being. These facilities also take the burden off overwhelmed hospitals. With urgent care facilities on the frontlines, the system runs smoother. This helps everyone receive the necessary care.&lt;/p&gt;

One<a class="moretag" href="/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 13:00:26 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During COVID-19, digital marketing is more valuable since more people are staying home and using digital devices more frequently. One way to continue patient acquisition during the pandemic is through online content that increases the chance of social sharing. Social sharing occurs when website visitors share your content on their social platform. This means that a website visitor found your content valuable or inspirational enough for them to want to share it with others on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social shares can noticeably improve the reputation of your practice and the ability to attract visitors who have commercial intent. Finding prospective patients through offline channels is more challenging during COVID-19, so increasing the chance of being found on social media through sharing posts is a great way to limit the financial impact that the pandemic has on your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are ways to improve your practice’s chance of receiving social shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of social sharing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content generation is a great way to increase organic traffic to your practice’s website during COVID-19, as well as long-term traffic. Within content marketing are additional marketing goals. The ideal result from content is not just increased traffic but also improved brand recognition and more conversions. One way to achieve this is through more social shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making social sharing a priority is one way that practices can get the most out of their content and weather the storm during the pandemic. The more social shares that a blog post, image, or another form of content gets, the more quality exposure it will receive from prospective patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, traffic received through social sharing is typically more valuable than traffic directly from search engines. Social sharing means the website visitor found the content through the referral of someone they trust on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Increasing patient acquisitions through social sharing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of content marketing is to increase conversions. Social sharing is a great way to achieve higher conversion rates by improving brand recognition and reaching more prospective clients with valuable content. Social sharing is similar to word of mouth. Word-of-mouth referrals are trusted, typically due to the patient having a quality experience with your practice and telling others about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social sharing works in a similar way. Website visitors who find quality content on your website will want to share it with others through social media. In a similar way as word of mouth, this is often a valuable referral that can improve brand and reputation and ultimately lead to an increase in patient acquisition. During COVID-19, it gives practices a chance to further their marketing goals and continue reaching prospective patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to encourage and increase social sharing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are simple content marketing strategies that practices can implement to increase the chance of receiving social shares. Perhaps most notably, quality content is essential. Visitors are far more likely to share content that they find valuable, intriguing, and inspirational. You can attract the reader’s attention through direct and detailed content and attention-grabbing titles and headers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also essential to have easily accessible share buttons for each piece of content on your website. This encourages the reader to share because they can do so quickly. Another simple and easy tip is to simply ask for a social share, which can be as easy as a short call to action at the end of each piece of content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Develop a content strategy with Doctor Genius&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 presents a unique challenge for many practices. If you are like many practices, finding the time to create quality content that increases the chance of social sharing is challenging because there are many other aspects of your business that require your attention. Doctor Genius offers content marketing for dental and healthcare practices. Feel free to reach out today for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

After all, you have so<a class="moretag" href="/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 13:00:27 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 crisis, you might feel an urge to abandon your social media pages. After all, you have so many other things to focus on, including patient care. Your social media channel is actually an important part of patient care during this pandemic. As a trusted provider, your patients and other members of the community count on your social media channel now more than ever. Find out how you can use social media marketing for good during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep people informed during COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical and dental practices always want patients to be healthy. This is even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Misinformation runs rampant online, and providers can cut through the noise to ensure patients know the facts. This is easy to do when using social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Advocate for social distancing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people do not understand the importance of social distancing or even what the phrase “flatten the curve” means. However, many listen to community health care providers. Providers can use social media channels, including Facebook and Twitter, to educate patients. Healthcare providers have influence over the people who follow them. Using that influence during a pandemic is critical for the common good and health of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Help people who need to get tested&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With flu and allergy season colliding with the coronavirus, there is a great deal of confusion about who needs to be tested. People are sneezing and coughing their way through the season, and many do not know if they have the virus. Health care providers can use social media channels to explain the symptoms of the virus. Then, people will know if those sneezes and coughs are just allergies, the flu, or something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, providers can give directions for people to follow. Do readers need to visit a provider? Should patients try telemedicine? Maybe social media followers need to self-isolate. Providing this information takes the burden off emergency rooms and urgent care facilities. It also helps people stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Show the steps that the practice is taking to keep people healthy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are afraid and want to be reassured. That includes knowing that medical practices and dental offices are taking proper precautions to combat the spread of COVID-19. Practices are encouraged to use social media to explain how they are keeping the office clean and free of contamination. That can include sanitation practices and screening policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Educate about telemedicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the world is focused on COVID-19, Americans still deal with other health issues. Some have high blood pressure, while others take medications that must be monitored. Practices can use social media to educate the public about telemedicine as a viable option. Many people are excited to embrace telemedicine instead of exposing themselves while at an office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make social media part of your public outreach strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public outreach is more important than ever before. Your patients are nervous and unsure of what to expect. Many will turn to you for advice and information. Speak directly to them through your social media channels. By providing resources and information, you can help limit the spread and ensure that people receive the necessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

This goes beyond the fear of getting sick. Schools and businesses have temporarily shut their doors, and shelter-in-place orders are in effect in most states. Life seemed to change overnight, and it is hard to process. There is a silver lining in this, though. You can take the time to spend with your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of family time during COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American families spend an average of 37 minutes of quality time with each other a day, according to a study by Visit Anaheim. Long hours at work, school schedules, and catching up on chores are the main reasons that families cannot spend more time together. Now, however, families are spending hours together each day, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of togetherness. Lear the biggest benefits of spending time together during the COVID-19 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boost academic performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who spend ample quality time with parents tend to perform better in school. During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents have become teachers. Parents work alongside their children, helping them complete schoolwork. Many mothers and fathers also use this time to play educational games and impart wisdom to the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When children go back to school after the pandemic, many will be in a better place academically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improve communication skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When parents spend most of the time at work or doing chores, it is impossible to model ideal behavior to the kids. Now, with parents at home, they can help children learn communication skills. Acting as models, parents show children the proper way to communicate and behave. Many parents are using the coronavirus pandemic to help children grow into well-adjusted adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create positive memories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive memories have a lasting impact on people’s well-being. People reach for positive memories during stressful times. These memories remind them that navigating obstacles is possible. Researchers have discovered that children who form positive memories with parents are more tolerant and have better cognitive skills. This also helps with mental health and well-being. As a bonus, those memories are there long after the parents are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build stronger mentoring skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults who spend quality time with family members build stronger mentoring skills. These adults fine-tune these skills while promoting good behavior during family time, and the skills carry over into the workplace. Business owners and employees benefit from developing mentoring skills. After developing the skills, employees and employers can perform better at work. These skills also help people improve the performance of others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the most out of family time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 crisis is an uncertain time but use it as a way to bond with your family. Talk frankly about the pandemic with kids and spouse, but do not dwell on the negative. Remember that this is a great time to bond with the people you love the most. Embrace this newfound family time while it is here. Before long, life will return to normal, and you will look back at this time and appreciate the memories you created.&lt;/p&gt;

Uncertainty hangs in the air as the stock market takes<a class="moretag" href="/times-of-uncertainty-can-create-value-for-your-customers-in-new-and-necessary-ways/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/times-of-uncertainty-can-create-value-for-your-customers-in-new-and-necessary-ways/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/times-of-uncertainty-can-create-value-for-your-customers-in-new-and-necessary-ways/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 13:00:14 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the entire world into a crisis. Uncertainty hangs in the air as the stock market takes a plunge, oil prices go into free fall, and several businesses panic, not knowing what to expect. The fact is, uncertainty is a constant element. It is always there, and like the weather, it is out of people&amp;#8217;s control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, businesses have two options to either get swept up by the uncertainties or take charge and innovate to create value for their customers in new and important ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Handling Uncertain Times as a Business Owner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During uncertain times, leaders are bound to make reflexive decisions such as halting hiring, reducing investments, cutting marketing and brand investments, and even ceasing decisions completely. These defensive measures are entirely reasonable and may even be necessary for survival in these uncertain times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they could be counterproductive in the short and long term. Such decisions could also put companies at a disadvantage in the aftermath of the crisis when situations improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective solution is to adopt the right approach and mindset. Instead of reacting instinctively to the news and situation resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, businesses can act quickly and proactively to change their path and follow another. This path can include focusing on new and innovative ways to add value to their customers. Ultimately, when it comes to value, prospective customers are the ones who can determine what counts as value and what does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create value, business owners need to understand how their customers define value and how they can meet those demands. This means understanding how the current situation is affecting them and thinking innovatively. Customers often have major considerations about value, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cost impact&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Revenue impact&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Risk impact&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Value impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost impact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers want to cut down on unnecessary expenses. When developing new solutions, business owners need to consider how much money their customers will save by recognizing and adopting the change over the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revenue impact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value proposition should offer potential customers an opportunity to increase their revenue. They will be more willing to adopt changes if ignoring the new value offering means that they might miss out on potential revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk impact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking of new ways to deliver value, business owners should look for ways to mitigate or eliminate risk factors that customers may face with the current products or services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Value impact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New values should help customers achieve their goals faster and more reliably. This also means allowing customers to realize the impact of adopting new values on functional, corporate, and personal goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stay Informed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business owners need to understand what drives the value determination of their customers and key stakeholders. This also means assessing and exposing the costs, limitations, and risks associated with their present situation. It demands carefully aligning with the most critical aspects of the purpose, approach, and capabilities of the business with the things that matter or are valuable to the customers. With the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, now is the time to get innovative and create new and necessary value.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the changes are<a class="moretag" href="/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 13:00:11 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the COVID-19 pandemic maintaining an ongoing status, consumer behavior seems to have changed overnight. Some of the changes are only temporary. However, others might become permanent. Businesses must adapt to these changes to serve consumers. Dental practices and businesses that adapt are likely to excel after the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expected changes after the COVID-19 crisis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has created a psychological change in consumers. Fear and anxiety drive people. Americans have concerns about products and businesses in ways never experienced before. The crisis has forced people to interact with businesses in new ways, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This crisis has changed customer preference. Many expect the psychological impact to last for the long term. By learning about the expected changes, practices can help to accommodate the needs of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technology-enabled solutions are the new normal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has made consumers turn to technology more to meet their needs. Consumers use technology to shop for groceries, order food, stay connected with people, and more. With the pandemic, patients are now relying on technology to remain in contact with medical professionals, financial situations, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people tried online services for the first time during the pandemic. Consumers are likely to continue using technology to aid in everyday tasks. This could create an increase in curbside pickup and grocery delivery, for example. Due to this, it is crucial for medical professionals to utilize online systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Demand for product transparency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health and safety will remain a top priority after the pandemic is under control. This will cause more consumers to demand transparency before choosing products. In the past, consumers often believed what companies told them about products. The pandemic has forever changed that. One reason for that is what consumers discovered about hand sanitizer during the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html&quot;&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, explains the effects of hand sanitizer on COVID-19. Many consumers relied on hand sanitizer to fight the coronavirus. Then, people found out that products with less than 60% alcohol are not effective. Consumers realized they need to research products to ensure they are effective. Otherwise, products might not deliver on a company’s promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health and safety demands will continue. Consumers will need more transparency from companies. That includes research that proves that products work. Companies that cannot provide this information might have trouble generating revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An increase in preventive medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on health and safety will go beyond consumer-buying habits. Consumers are also expected to make preventive care a priority after the crisis is over. This priority branches to doctor and dental visits that help them stay healthy. Some people skip their annual exams. That is expected to be rare in the coming years, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers might not see doctors and dentists the traditional way. The coronavirus crisis has created a boom for telemedicine and teledentistry. Many expect it to continue well after the virus is under control. Many dentists, physicians, and consumers appreciate the ease of telemedicine and teledentistry. It makes it easier to monitor patients and provides consultations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Embrace the changing landscape after COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 will have a lasting impact on consumers and the businesses that serve them. Americans understand that life can change on a dime. People are more involved in the products they buy and the care they receive. Businesses, including dental and medical practices, must make changes to meet these demands. Those that do so will meet the needs of consumers and might even enjoy an increase in revenue in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

It is also an economic crisis, with<a class="moretag" href="/new-irs-guidelines-from-covid-19/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-irs-guidelines-from-covid-19/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-irs-guidelines-from-covid-19/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 13:00:56 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Businesses and individuals have realized that COVID-19 is more than a health crisis. It is also an economic crisis, with people and businesses around the country feeling the sting of lost wages and revenue. The IRS has stepped in to lessen the pain by providing some guidelines for individuals and businesses. These new guidelines will help Americans find steady footing during these uncertain times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19 and tax guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are aware that the IRS extended the deadline to file taxes to July 15, 2020. What many do not realize is that this is just the tip of the iceberg regarding IRS guidelines for the coronavirus pandemic. The IRS is making it easier for employers to pay employees, even those who cannot go to work due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the IRS has relaxed guidelines for those who need to take money out of retirement accounts. Learn more about how these guidelines impact individuals and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Employee retention credit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Employee Retention Credit is one of the IRS’s most exciting offerings. Businesses of all sizes can apply for this credit. In order to qualify, businesses must meet one of two criteria. First, this credit is available to companies that have suspended by a government order as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, businesses with gross receipts that total less than 50% of what they were in the same quarter of the previous year are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies can be eligible for a credit that is 50% of the qualifying wages, which are capped at $10,000. Employees can include the amount they pay in health care when applying for this tax credit. Once approved, employers can reduce employment tax deposits as a method of reimbursement. If employment taxes do not cover the full credit, the IRS can send direct payments. Then, companies can use the money to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paid sick leave refundable credit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees who are sick need to stay home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The IRS has announced a paid sick leave refundable credit to ease the burden on employees and employers. Employees who cannot work due to COVID-19 can receive up to 80 hours of paid sick leave, and the employer receives a fully refundable tax credit. The IRS states that the tax credit also covers the Medicare tax and health care expenses the employer has paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paid family leave refundable credit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With schools and childcare facilities shut down, parents are having a hard time getting to work. The IRS announced a paid family leave refundable credit for those who have to care for their children. Employees can take up to 10 weeks of paid family leave, and the employer receives a refundable tax credit. The credit includes health care expenses and the Medicare tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Early withdrawal penalty waived&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, people will not have to reach into retirement accounts for money during the coronavirus pandemic. Still, those who have been impacted by COVID-19 can withdraw up to $100,000 without paying the 10% early withdrawal fee. Taxpayers must claim the distribution when filing taxes. They can spread out over three years to avoid paying the full tax obligation at once. Also, those who pay the distribution back within three years will receive a refund on any taxes paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let the system help you during the COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worrying about your health and your finances is overwhelming. Fortunately, you do have some financial options to soften the blow of COVID-19. If your company is eligible for a tax credit, take advantage of it. These credits can help businesses stay afloat during this difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;

It has altered the way many practices can reach their patients and pushed states to adopt new safety guidelines. While managing your business from home, it&amp;#8217;s essential to know which mediums are still accessible to reach your clientele. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;With more people at home, more web searches are happening than before lockdowns went into effect. Many of the businesses that will thrive during this downturn will be the ones who invest in search engine marketing (SEO). While other businesses go dark, an increase in web presence can make you a more prominent voice of authority for organic search. This is especially pertinent for practices vying for local ranking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;The Importance of search engine marketing during COVID-19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Here are four reasons that you should step up your SEO campaigns during this global pandemic:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;1. SEO brings in customers who are ready to spend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Having cash flow can be the difference-maker that helps a business survive during tough times. SEO campaigns generate a better return on investment than other marketing techniques. Unlike more general marketing, which may target people by region, search has the power to link a searcher&amp;#8217;s need to their desired service. As &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/on-site-seo-factors/295357/#close&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Search Engine Journal Points out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;, consistent posting, allowing more services online, and designing a user-friendly website will help your online business space overcome changes to Google&amp;#8217;s algorithm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Since businesses have to operate differently due to COVID-19, Google now permits virtual consultations as a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink&quot; href=&quot;https://support.google.com/business/answer/9798848?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;GMB listing for telehealth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt; providers. For practices that provide this resource, new searchers in the market, or those who have time constraints are more likely to turn to you. If you are a dental provider and would like to learn more about teledentistry, reach out to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink&quot; href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/demo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;schedule a demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;2. Scarcity leads to more online searches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;An increased number of people staying at home means that there will be more people online searching for the things they need. Household items that were once easy to find have virtually disappeared from store shelves. Ranking search terms for any of these hard-to-find products, like toilet paper and hand sanitizer, is a traffic gold mine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Businesses can also take advantage of the scarcity by ranking for alternatives to these products. This will also lead to a significant increase in traffic during these uncertain times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;3. Search engine traffic can be measured and tracked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;There is little guesswork involved when running SEO campaigns. A business&amp;#8217;s analytics gives them detailed information about their users, their behaviors, and the keywords that brought them to their website. It allows owners and managers to tweak their search engine marketing efforts as needed and increase their ROI. Search engine metrics can also help identify poor copy that does not convert. When times are hard, businesses should focus on marketing efforts that can be easily tracked and adjusted.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;4. Things will eventually get back to normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;While COVID-19 has caused panic globally, it is unlikely to change the way the world works significantly. SEO marketing will continue to be an effective way to reach customers, and businesses that increased their traffic by adapting to the changes the pandemic caused will be better positioned when things get back to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Even though paid SEO campaigns can lead to positive results in a short amount of time, ranking for hot keywords in your industry takes time. Prime your business to be a winner by getting ahead of your search engine marketing needs and using SEO to generate additional revenue during this pandemic.

Now more than ever, medical practices need to find an effective way to reach patients in homes that will need treatment. It is possible to start rebounding now so your practice will be stronger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips to position your practice as a local leader during and after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three ways to thrive during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when the pandemic reaches its peak, there will be a need for local practices. Local practices are the backbone of communities and can thrive by adapting to the new normal. This includes embracing technology and increasing the commitment to health standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practices also need to connect with clients via social media and online. Offices that do these three things can be industry leaders well before the pandemic is under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Embrace technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, big tech is in the position to come out ahead when the coronavirus pandemic comes to an end. With most Americans engaged in strict social distancing, people are more reliant on technology than ever before. While big tech might take the lead, businesses of all types can rebound by embracing technology. This will help businesses today and well after the pandemic comes to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical community is already doing this. Physicians now see large numbers of patients via video chat and phone calls. Even dentists have joined in, using teledentistry to evaluate patients and give second opinions. Businesses that use technology will rebound during the COVID-19 crisis and be on solid footing when it ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Show a commitment to health standards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are afraid right now, and that fear will not disappear after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Businesses can start rebounding now by reaching out to clients and telling them what they are doing to prevent the spread of the disease. Also, these businesses should explain that these standards are not just in place for the pandemic. The health of patients is always a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stay connected with social media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands like Instacart and Dial have increased social media spend during COVID-19, and that makes sense. Both brands appeal to consumers during this crisis. Still, all businesses can benefit from being active on social media during this time. People spend more time online right now, and social media marketing is a good way to reach customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people turn to local practices for information regarding COVID-19. Dentists, physicians, and others can use social media to get messages out to the public at large. This can include information about the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve. Doctors and dentists can also use the channel to help people take preventative measures for their physical and oral health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices can also help lighten the mood on social media. With so much frightening information, funny memes can help followers relax. The key is to find the sweet spot between informative and entertaining posts. Practices do not want to make the mistake of always providing humor when followers also need guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start rebounding today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a vaccine for COVID-19 months away, you cannot wait until the pandemic is over to get to work. If you wait too long, you will have a hard time rebounding. Between technology, a commitment to health, and an online presence, you will stay on people’s minds during this crisis. You can continue to see patients and build loyalty that will last well beyond the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

As knowledge about the virus evolves,<a class="moretag" href="/new-covid-19-laws-that-affect-your-workforce/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-covid-19-laws-that-affect-your-workforce/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-covid-19-laws-that-affect-your-workforce/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 13:00:26 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Medical professionals face unique sets of challenges and specific regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic. As knowledge about the virus evolves, and as cases of affected patients continue to rise, community responses and government regulations also evolve to help practices safely manage patients&amp;#8217; health, protect their staff&amp;#8217;s safety, and remain financially solvent. Below are several of these new laws and protocols that likely affect your medical practice, plus recommended and required steps to take.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though current at the time of writing, these regulations and guidelines are subject to change, so be sure to verify with official sources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;OSHA Regulations and New Protocols&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As part of its efforts to protect workers from on-the-job hazards, the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration (OSHA) issued interim guidance for specific worker groups and their employers, with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html#healthcare&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; specific instructions to health care employers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. OSHA&amp;#8217;s infection prevention recommendations include engineering controls (such as the use of physical barriers between patients and staff), administrative controls (such as isolating patients and minimizing staff present for procedures), and safe work practices (like avoiding unnecessary touching of surfaces) to help protect workers from COVID-19 exposure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Employers of health care workers remain responsible for following applicable OSHA requirements. Workplaces such as dental offices and medical practices with occupational exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials, including saliva in dental procedures, must comply with OSHA&amp;#8217;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Bloodborne Pathogens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; standards. These standards include the practice of universal safety precautions. While employers still are responsible for complying with OSHA&amp;#8217;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.132&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Personal Protective Equipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; standards, which includes the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Respiratory Protection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; standard, OSHA is providing temporary flexibility for certain requirements under these and other standards. Specifically, OSHA has issued&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; temporary enforcement guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; related to the executive order making general use respirators available to health care personnel during the COVID-19 emergency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Protective Equipment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Employers must provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to staff to limit their potential exposure to infectious hazards. Workers who must use PPE must be trained on when to use it, what equipment is necessary, how to put on and take off PPE to prevent self-contamination, how to dispose of or disinfect PPE properly, how to maintain PPE, and limitations of the PPE safely. Applicable standards include &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.133&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Eye and Face Protection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.138&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Hand Protection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.138&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Respiratory Protection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Recommended PPE for health care personnel who interact with patients or could be exposed to contaminated materials include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Isolation gowns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nitrile exam gloves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified, disposable N95 or better respirators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Eye and face protection, such as goggles and face shield&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Given supply chain shortages of PPE across the country, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) updated its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;recommendations to allow facemasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; as an acceptable alternative to N95 respirators, with respirators prioritized for use in procedures more likely to generate respiratory aerosols. Practices should preserve their inventory of PPE as much as reasonably possible. In case of shortage, PPE protocols may require modification to allow the reuse of equipment or allow alternatives that do not meet the standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Required Training&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Employers also are responsible for training workers about:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Sources of occupational exposure to the virus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Appropriate workplace protocols to prevent or reduce exposure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How to isolate people with suspected COVID-19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How to report possible cases to public health authorities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;All training must be provided during scheduled work times for free to the employee. Refer to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/training/library&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;OSHA&amp;#8217;s reference library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for training resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;State-Specific Standards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Twenty-eight states have OSHA-approved State Plans, which could include more stringent or extensive standards. For example, the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) mandates certain employers follow the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/OHB/Pages/ATDStd.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Aerosol Transmissible Diseases (ATD)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; standard. Employers must follow the stricter guidelines, where both state and federal regulations exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actions to Take:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Perform a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/hazardrecognition.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;hazard assessment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that identifies potential sources of exposure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Establish office protocols to minimize risks of exposure, including limiting patients, prohibiting visitors, screening staff, and patients for symptoms, disinfecting surfaces more frequently and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Consult the CDC&amp;#8217;s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Review OSHA standards, especially &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Bloodborne Pathogens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.132&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Personal Protective Equipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Respiratory Protection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Review applicable state occupational standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ensure your staff has adequate PPE, and they know how to use it properly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Inventory your PPE and prioritize the use in case of shortages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Provide training to staff as required by OSHA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-employer-paid-leave&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; includes the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act (EPSLA) and the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act (EFMLEA). Enacted into federal law on March 18, 2020, the legislation is effective April 1, 2020, until December 31, 2020. These laws cover all private employers with fewer than 500 employees and require them to provide paid leave to employees under certain circumstances related to COVID-19. The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#8217;s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) administers and enforces the requirements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emergency Sick Leave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Covered employers who are not electing an exception (see below) must provide any employee two weeks (up to 80 hours for full-time employees) of emergency paid sick leave in certain circumstances, detailed below. This sick leave is available to all employees, regardless of their length of employment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Emergency sick leave must be paid at the worker&amp;#8217;s regular rate of pay if the employee cannot work because:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The employee is quarantined on the advice of a health care provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The employee is under a federal, state, or local government isolation order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The employee is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Note that the amount paid is subject to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-questions&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;aggregate caps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Sick leave for one of the above reasons is limited to a maximum benefit payment of $511 per day, or $5,110 total over the entire emergency paid sick leave time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If the employee cannot work because of a need to care for someone subject to quarantine (pursuant to government order or health care provider advice) or to care for a child under 18 years of age whose school or child care provider is closed for COVID-19 related reasons, then the employee is eligible for up to 80 hours (two weeks) of emergency paid sick leave paid at two-thirds the employee&amp;#8217;s regular rate of pay. In these circumstances, the sick leave benefit pays a maximum of $200 per day or $2,000 over the entire two week period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Note that the employee cannot take emergency paid sick leave both for themselves and to care for another; the total hours of emergency paid sick leave cannot exceed 80 hours. Also, note that you cannot require an employee to first exhaust other paid leave. You must grant emergency sick leave in addition to any pre-existing leave benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emergency FMLA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Covered employers must provide employees that have been employed for at least 30 days with up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave when an employee cannot work. The reason for the employee&amp;#8217;s absence must be a need to care for a child under 18 years of age whose school or child care provider is closed for reasons related to COVID-19. Employees are to be paid two-thirds of their regular rate of pay for the hours they would have been scheduled to work during that period. The maximum pay is $200 per day, or $12,000 in the aggregate if the employee takes two weeks of paid emergency sick leave followed by 10 weeks of emergency leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exceptions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Employers with less than 50 employees or who are health care providers under the FFCRA&amp;#8217;s definition may provide FFCRA paid leave to their employees, or they may elect for an exemption to the requirements. According to the regulations, an employer might need to rely on the exemption if it determines that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Providing paid sick leave or expanded FMLA would cause the business to cease operating at a minimal capacity because expenses would exceed revenue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The absence of the employee requesting paid sick leave or expanded FMLA would pose a substantial risk to the finances or operational capabilities of the business because of the employee&amp;#8217;s specialized skills or responsibilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are not sufficient workers able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or services of the employee requesting paid sick leave or expanded FMLA, and the labor or services are needed to operate at minimal capacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tax Credits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Covered employers qualify for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/covid-19-related-tax-credits-for-required-paid-leave-provided-by-small-and-midsize-businesses-faqs&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;tax credits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that provide dollar-for-dollar reimbursement for all qualifying emergency paid sick leave or expanded FMLA wages paid under the FFCRA, up to the aggregate payment caps. The fully refundable tax credits also include the employer&amp;#8217;s share of Medicare tax for those wages and the cost of maintaining health insurance coverage for the employee during the sick leave period. The employer is not subject to the employer portion of social security tax imposed on those wages. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Employers claim the credits on their federal employment tax returns, but they can benefit more quickly by reducing their federal employment tax deposits. If there are not enough federal employment taxes to cover the amount of the credits, employers may request an advance payment of the credits from the IRS by submitting a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-7200&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actions to Take:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Post the required FFCRA notice according to the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-poster-questions&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; notice posting requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. The notice must be in clearly visible locations and sent to remote staff. To obtain notices free of charge, contact the WHD at 1-866-4-USWAGE (1-866-487-9243), or download and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/posters/FFCRA_Poster_WH1422_Non-Federal.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; print the notice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; yourself from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Determine whether your practice will require the use of the exemption to FFCRA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In addition to policies around requiring symptomatic or at-risk employees to stay home, create policies regarding emergency sick leave, and expanded FMLA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If your practice will not be taking exception to FFCRA and intends to obtain tax credits, thoroughly document the staff absences and leaves taken for COVID-19 related reasons, including specific details such as the names and ages of children, the name of the closed school or child care provider, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Retain a copy of Form 941, Employer&amp;#8217;s Quarterly Federal Tax Return.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Local and State Sick and Family Leave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Several cities and states have enacted their own emergency sick leave and paid family leave requirements to expand protections beyond the federal programs. For example, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfgov.org/olse/san-francisco-paid-sick-leave-coronavirus&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;San Francisco issued new guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that requires covered employers in the city to let employees use accrued sick leave for several COVID-19 related reasons. San Francisco also created the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfmayor.org/article/mayor-breed-announces-plan-provide-paid-sick-leave-workers-impacted-coronavirus&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Workers and Families First Program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to offer financial incentives for businesses to provide an additional five days of sick leave pay.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actions to Take:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Consult your city government, state labor agencies, and benefits providers to find out whether you have additional employment laws to follow for sick leave or family leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restrictions on Different Practice Types&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) issued &amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-non-emergent-elective-medical-recommendations.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Non-Emergent, Elective Medical Services, and Treatment Recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;#8221; to guide practices in determining what health care they should postpone during the COVID-19 crisis. Many state governments, state medical boards, and local jurisdictions have issued restrictions on different practices and different procedures. The intent of the restrictions is to help prevent the spread of the virus by limiting potential contact with infected persons, preserve the availability of health care personnel to care for patients affected by COVID-19, ration use of limited supplies of PPE, and save additional hospital space to care for infected patients. Generally, all licensed health care providers should postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately necessary to prevent serious adverse medical consequences or death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many states have issued orders specific to specialty. For example, in California, the Department of Public Health issued &amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/GuidanceforDentistry.aspx#&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Guidance for Dentistry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&amp;#8221; The directive:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Advises dentists to postpone all routine, cosmetic, and non-emergency care indefinitely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Requires dentists be available to their patients of record for emergency care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Instructs dentists to screen each patient to be sure they are asymptomatic and have not been exposed to someone with COVID-19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Details protocols for treating patients for emergency dental issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actions to Take:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Review any federal, state, professional, or CDC directives applicable to your specialty and your location.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Postpone any elective or cosmetic surgeries, as well as non-emergency procedures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Thoroughly document any decisions to proceed with treatment or delay scheduled procedures and surgeries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Develop guidelines for allowable office visits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Follow up-to-date guidance on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-laws-what-workplaces-need-to-do-if-an-employee-or-patient-gets-the-covid-19/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; treating patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Considerations for Contract Staff&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Independent contractors are not employees. They are not eligible for emergency sick leave or expanded FMLA under the FFCRA, and you cannot claim tax credits. However, there are a few financial assistance resources possibly available to contract staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, eligibility criteria are expanded to include people not typically eligible for unemployment insurance. The CARES Act provides for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20200402-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for independent contractors and self-employed individuals who have lost employment or have reduced hours of work as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contract staff (and your practice) might qualify for a $10,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/economic-injury-disaster-loan-emergency-advance&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; through the Small Business Administration, as well as the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program-ppp&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Paycheck Protection Program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. These programs, enacted through the CARES Act, provide temporary, immediate relief for small businesses, self-employed individuals, and independent contractors. The funds are intended to pay for payroll expenses, as well as some operating expenses like rent and utilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Special note to California practices or practices that use California-based workers: With legislation effective January 1, 2020, classification of workers as independent contractors narrowed significantly. While&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Assembly Bill No. 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (AB5) exempts physicians and dentists, nurses, physician&amp;#8217;s assistants, behavioral health providers, medical transcriptionists, and more are subject to the law. By default, everyone not exempted is considered an employee; businesses bear the burden of ensuring an individual fulfills the criteria of the so-called ABC test for independent contractors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If a worker you treated as an independent contractor attempts to file for standard unemployment insurance, the state Employment Development Department (EDD) likely will audit your working relationship to determine whether the classification was correct. The EDD could determine the individual should have been classified as a W2 wage employee. In that case, you will be liable for the back payment of employment taxes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actions to Take:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/blog/financing-options-now-available-resulting-from-covid-19/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; available resources for financial assistance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, if needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If in California, review the potential impact of the AB5 legislation on your classification of workers as independent contractors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay-at-home Orders and Social Distancing Protocols&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;No federal stay-at-home order has been issued, though the White House recommends the country follow social distancing measures. However, up to 97 percent of the United States population is subject to state and/or local stay-at-home orders. Nearly all stay-at-home orders include exceptions related to essential activities and purposes, including health care. Most stay-at-home orders do not consider elective medical procedures and surgeries to be essential, and as such, prohibit them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Though physicians&amp;#8217; offices, dental practices, and other health care providers generally are considered essential businesses, many city, county, or state jurisdictions have imposed mandatory social distancing protocols. For example, Eagle County, Colorado, requires essential businesses that remain open to create and visibly post a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eaglecounty.us/PublicHealth/Documents/Appendix-A-Social-Distancing-Protocol_FINAL/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Social Distancing Protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that explains how the business plans to meet social distancing, sanitizing, and cleaning requirements. Employers must give every employee working on-site a copy of the protocol, and businesses must follow the protocol. Similarly, several counties in California now require dental offices, ambulatory clinics, and more to complete the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cda.org/Portals/0/pdfs/COVID-19_Pdfs/Appendix-A-Social-Distancing-Protocol.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Social Distancing Protocol PDF form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;; the form must be given to employees, posted near the facility&amp;#8217;s entrance, and be available to any enforcing authority upon request.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actions to Take:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Review any local order to stay-at-home, and confirm your practice does not perform any prohibited activities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Delay all non-urgent patient care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Establish and follow the required and recommended social distancing protocols whenever possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Make adjustments to the workplace and to protocols to allow staff more physical distance from each other and from the public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Consider allowing staff to complete certain tasks remotely, provided that appropriate security measures will be in place to fulfill HIPAA-related privacy requirements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Consider implementing telehealth technologies to continue to serve patients remotely via virtual visits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Regularly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; check the CDC for updated guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; on safety precautions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Stay current on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; OSHA guidelines and interim enforcement orders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; regarding workplace safety requirements and recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Check with national and state chapters of professional organizations, such as the American Dental Association, for practice-specific guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Comply with current and updated labor law requirements from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the Department of Labor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Follow more specific local and state orders for public health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Explore options available for financial assistance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Establish communication channels with staff and patients and clearly communicate information about your practice&amp;#8217;s protocols and policies for handling their health and safety during the COVID-19 emergency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

As the pandemic rages on, dentists are on the frontlines. If<a class="moretag" href="/dental-teams-front-line-commitments/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-teams-front-line-commitments/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-teams-front-line-commitments/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 13:00:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is affecting all health care providers, including dentists. As the pandemic rages on, dentists are on the frontlines. If you are a dentist, you are likely to continue conducting emergency procedures at your office. Also, you might find yourself helping at the local hospital. Find out more about the frontline commitments dental teams are facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dental emergencies and COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 14 seconds, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/Science%20and%20Research/HPI/Files/HPIgraphic_0819_1.pdf?la=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;someone visits a hospital or emergency room for a dental condition&lt;/a&gt;, according to the American Dental Association. Dentists and physicians urge patients to go to dental offices instead. Going to dental offices takes the burden off hospitals. Also, dental patients will lower the risk of exposure by avoiding emergency rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the question then becomes how to know if a dentist is open during quarantine? The American Dental Association has created guidelines for dental emergencies. Patients should reach out to a dental office immediately if they experience one of these emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bleeding or swelling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bleeding or swelling in or around the mouth is a dental emergency. Gum infection, trauma, malnutrition, or pregnancy could cause mouth bleeding or swelling. After treating the problem, the patient should feel more comfortable. Also, fast treatment prevents infection from spreading. An infection can be dangerous, so patients should visit the dentist immediately. Failure to do so could lead to a more serious medical issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tooth or jaw pain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is a sign that something is wrong with the teeth or jaws. Pain could be caused by a cavity or infection, among other things. Unfortunately, untreated pain often continues to get worse. Patients who have pain should seek treatment quickly before it becomes unmanageable. The dentist can alleviate the pain and treat the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in store-bought medication to relieve pain will only provide temporary relief. A dentist can help patients receive the lasting relief they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Broken or knocked-out teeth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who have broken or knocked-out teeth need immediate care, even during the COVID-19 crisis. The dentist might be able to save the teeth. If not, the dentist can restore the teeth if needed. Failure to seek treatment will allow the teeth to shift. This could lead to bone loss and other oral problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post-op care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who underwent dental surgery might want to put off post-operative care. Stitch removal and dressing changes are critical. Dentists still want patients to come in for these services. Offices are taking special precautions during the pandemic. These precautions limit the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dentists in hospitals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentists are also working on the frontlines in hospitals. Some dentists help other frontline workers by donating PPE equipment to fight COVID-19. Others are volunteering at local hospitals. For example, California is asking dentists to volunteer. More dentists will likely be needed in hospitals as the pandemic gets closer to the peak in the following months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Providing valuable services during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has created an all-hands-on-deck situation. Dentists have answered the call by providing emergency services and helping at hospitals. This crisis has brought dental and medical communities together. Both have the desire to reduce patient exposure and help those that are sick. With dentists joining the fight, hospitals are less overwhelmed and can provide the necessary care during the COVID-19 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help you understand the importance of telemedicine, we will go through the steps for getting started. Below are a few tips on scheduling virtual appointments while we get through this pandemic together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using telemedicine during COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the federal government has relaxed rules regarding HIPAA compliance and telemedicine. Still, providers are encouraged to choose a HIPAA-compliant vendor. First, providers can check with their current EHR vendor to see if it has telemedicine functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our clients, we now offer a TeleDentistry service. If you work in the dental space, contact our office to discuss setting up this service for your practice. Doctor Genius&amp;#8217; option works as an extension to your site&amp;#8217;s interface, allowing patients to connect directly from your website to you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get the proper technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once practices select software, it is time to consider equipment. Providers need a high-quality webcam and microphone to offer the service. Most computers have both, but many providers choose to purchase standalone equipment. The right equipment improves the quality of video appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providers also need a fast internet connection. At a minimum, 5 Mbps upload and 15 Mbps download speeds are required. Providers should check the internet speed by running a speed test. It is easy to conduct a speed test online. Those who use Wi-Fi can speed up the connection by plugging the internet directly into the computer through an ethernet cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choose a dedicated space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients want virtual visits to mimic in-person visits. That means they expect to have the provider’s full attention during telemedicine appointments. Providers should set up a dedicated space for these visits. After selecting a space for the appointments, providers should check the lighting, ensuring that it is bright but does not cause any glare. It is also wise to check for echoes and noise when selecting a room for these visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test the equipment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providers should not conduct telemedicine visits until they test the equipment. Testing is as simple as having a video chat with another provider. The provider can check the sound and video quality, paying special attention to latency. If the video takes time to buffer, it will be difficult to conduct a telemedicine appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inform the patient of technical needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many patients have yet to undergo a telemedicine appointment. Providers should explain what is necessary for these appointments, including access to video chat. Ask the patients to sit in a quiet, private room during the appointment. Some will prefer scheduling appointments when no one else is home, so providers should mention that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contact the patient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After scheduling a telemedicine appointment, the provider needs to contact the patient with a link. This can be done through an online portal or via text message if the patient has opted in to receive SMS messages. The patient is directed to a virtual waiting room after clicking on the link. Then, when the provider is ready, the appointment begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get started with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telemedicine makes it much easier for providers to see patients during this health crisis. If you have yet to use this, consider adding telemedicine software. By providing your patients with this option, you can continue to see your patients during this difficult time. This will allow you to limit your in-person visits while still caring for your patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With quarantine continuing to be in effect throughout the country, telemedicine and other techniques like it are becoming the solution that medical practices need to continue providing professional care.&lt;/p&gt;

With<a class="moretag" href="/what-you-need-to-know-qualifying-for-sba-disaster-loans/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-qualifying-for-sba-disaster-loans/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-qualifying-for-sba-disaster-loans/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2020 21:01:13 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amidst the trying and hectic times, SBA disaster loans can help businesses find a &lt;br/&gt;solution to stay above water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the nation-wide quarantine in effect, many small businesses are wondering how they can protect their employees, business, and themselves. The Small Business Association has several options and recommendations on how to proceed. This blog will cover what you need to know about what the SBA loan is and how the process works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on this topic or to apply for an SBA loan, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;sba.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Current SItuation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reports on March 29, 2020, President Trump stated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;social distancing guidelines from the federal government would last until April 30.&lt;/a&gt; While the quarantine on what businesses can or cannot open is a decision of the state’s government, small businesses need a more lucrative solution than waiting around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;confirmed cases in the US reaching 163, 539 as of March 31, 2020, &lt;/a&gt; and expected to continue climbing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, it is crucial for businesses to develop a plan. Business owners may not even realize that they do not need to experience a disaster to qualify for an SBA disaster loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Understanding What an SBA Disaster Loan Is&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SBA explains on their website that, “The SBA offers disaster assistance in the form of low-interest loans to businesses, renters, and homeowners located in regions affected by declared disasters.&amp;#8221; A major concern for small and large businesses across the country involves being able to pay bills along with employees’ payroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By filing for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/EIDL_Information_and_Documentation_-_3-23-2020.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SBA disaster loan&lt;/a&gt;, you can use it to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;browser-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay fixed debt payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover payroll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover accounts payable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay bills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are certain stipulations and requirements a company needs to meet for an SBA disaster loan, the loan can cover a max of $2 million for economic injury. This way, businesses can support their employees and their company’s infrastructure during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Qualifying for a Loan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to qualifying for an SBA disaster loan, SBA.gov states that any business with less than 500 employees in the United States that cannot pay bills due to COVID-19. With most companies and industries on hold, much of the economy’s flow is stopped. This ripple effect is causing a variety of issues for various businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the interest rate for a small business will be 3.75% and 2.75% for small businesses. The eligibility for the exact amount of this loan will depend on the size and type of resources. The SBA will also take any financial resources the business has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Applying for The Loan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is possible to fill out a paper form and apply in person, it is faster and recommended by the SBA to apply online at their website. After applying for the loan, you can print it out to keep a copy for yourself. In most cases, it can take anywhere from two to three weeks with a disbursement of $225,000 available within five days of approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need immediate assistance or funds, you can request an emergency advance within three days of receiving the application to the amount of $10,000. The sooner people act and apply for this loan, the more likely they will be able to have the necessary funds for themselves, their business, and their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Included Loan Forgiveness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor to consider when applying for a loan is the possibility of loan forgiveness. With an SBA disaster loan, there is partial loan forgiveness. Loan forgiveness may be possible with issues involving payroll costs, interest payments on a mortgage, along with rent payments for a lease that was in effect prior to February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are limits to the amount of forgiveness for the loan. During the application process, you can request assistance from SBA. Our team can also help provide guidance when necessary.  The SBA also will go into detail about the loan and the process.&lt;/p&gt;

Many are struggling<a class="moretag" href="/financing-options-now-available-resulting-from-covid-19/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/financing-options-now-available-resulting-from-covid-19/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/financing-options-now-available-resulting-from-covid-19/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 08:13:49 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;As the world navigates the effects of COVID-19, people are grappling with a variety of new challenges. Many are struggling to cope with the potential physical, mental, sociological, security, and logistical changes that the quarantine causes. Additionally, many businesses and individuals alike are feeling mounting financial pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many homeowners and renters are worried that they may not be able to handle their financial obligations due to increasing layoffs, a drop in working hours, or missing work for health reasons. Drops in operating hours and complete business shutdowns have owners concerned as to how they will be able to pay their workers, keep their businesses afloat, and afford personal expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the future may appear uncertain for many, there are some potential options that can help people weather the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loan and Rent Deferment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuing issue of COVID-19 has led to shutdowns of large portions of the economy. As a result, many have seen a significant decrease in their working hours, and some have experienced layoffs. Consequently, workers and business owners alike are encountering pay and revenue cuts. Businesses and their workers are scrambling to manage their finances, including making payments on their loans and rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Loan Deferment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the options that may be available to those in this situation is a loan deferment. A &lt;a href= &quot;https://www.debt.org/students/forbearance-deferment/&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;loan deferment&lt;/a&gt; is a set amount of time where the borrower or renter does not have to make principal payments to the lender or landlord. The borrower will typically apply for a deferment when circumstances like unemployment, school, and military obligations render them unable to make their payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deferment is typically negotiated in advance between the two parties, and one of the first steps includes the renter providing a viable reason as to why they need the delay. Depending on the terms of the deferment, the landlord may also waive the interest payments for the borrower or renter during the deferment period. On March 13, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2020/fil20017.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;began encouraging financial institutions&lt;/a&gt; to implement policies which will assist customers and communities affected by COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the FDIC has provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdic.gov/coronavirus/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a page on their website&lt;/a&gt; as a resource for both banks and their customers. In following these guidelines, major banks like Citibank and Bank of America have offered a variety of relief options to their customers. Some of them have aided small businesses, consumers, mortgage borrowers, auto borrowers, and more through deferment options and refunds on late fees. Customers should contact their lenders to see if they offer special COVID-19 deferment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rent Deferment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With hours decreasing and businesses shutting down, business owners and individuals alike are wondering how they will be able to make rent payments. Renters fear that missing these payments will potentially result in mounting bills and even eviction. Additionally, landlords often rely on rent payments to finance the mortgage on their properties, or for their incomes in general. Unfortunately, many renters and tenants have not planned for incidents like these, and as a result, it puts both parties in a tough position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landlords and their tenants must work together to establish a plan or agreement which will mitigate losses for both parties during this time. Larger property management groups are more likely to be able to cope with missed rent payments. Unfortunately, most individual renters will be less likely to afford a rent deferment. If smaller renters are totally unable to provide a deferment, they may be able to grant their tenants a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grace_period.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grace period&lt;/a&gt; on their monthly rent dues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, due to the evolving nature of the situation, it is currently impossible to say how long an appropriate time frame for a deferment or grace period should be. Deferment periods vary, but landlords usually defer payments for 90 days. It is not uncommon for landlords to allow tenants to add the missed payment(s) on to the end of their lease to be paid at its expiration, while others set up systems for tenants to pay off deferred rent incrementally. Nevertheless, tenants should strive to pay their rent on time until they can reach an agreement with their renters. Each renter will differ in their offerings, so tenants must contact them and ask about any available payment options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Government Assistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 18, the federal government enacted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818322136/heres-what-is-in-the-families-first-coronavirus-aid-package-trump-approved&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Families First Coronavirus Aid Package&lt;/a&gt;. The package includes benefits like paid sick leave, free virus testing for uninsured individuals, unemployment assistance, general Medicaid funding, and food aid. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_20_042&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sixty-day moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on evictions and foreclosures for single-family homeowners. To qualify, they must have mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Additionally, mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will suspend evictions and foreclosures for at least 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/state-fiscal-responses-to-covid-19.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Some state and local governments&lt;/a&gt; have signed financial aid packages into effect that aim to help individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19. Many of these include mandates that assist tenants during this time, a time in which many are unable to pay their rent. For example, California has placed a temporary moratorium on evictions and mandated that essential utilities remain on, regardless of payment from the tenant. Additionally, New York implemented a ninety-day mandate protecting commercial and residential tenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Oregon rolled out an order temporarily barring landlords for evicting renters for nonpayment, and Utah will soon offer deferment plans for tenants in the state. Local governments like Seattle and Miami-Dade have also taken similar action via the court system. As time passes, more state and local governments are adopting laws that assist businesses and residents. Although some of the state and local measures are barring evictions and foreclosures, but are still requiring rent and mortgage payments, they may change with the evolution of the overall COVID-19 situation in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Small Business Association Assistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Small Business Association (SBA) has published its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;options and resources&lt;/a&gt; which aim to assist small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This comes as the White House implemented the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/the-u-s-response-to-coronavirus-summary-of-the-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-supplemental-appropriations-act-2020/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act&lt;/a&gt;, which included an allocation of $20 million to the SBA.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To keep loan repayments affordable, the SBA provides products with long-term repayments, up to a maximum of 30 years. Terms are determined on a business’s particular situation and based upon each borrower’s ability to repay. These Economic Injury Disaster Loans are one component of the federal government’s comprehensive response to COVID-19. Although the SBA’s programs are only one part of a comprehensive effort by the federal government, that part can be critically useful to small businesses and their workers in the current economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these offerings is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sba.gov/disaster-assistance/coronavirus-covid-19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program&lt;/a&gt;. This program is the SBA’s new addition to its disaster assistance program. The offering provides low-interest working capital loans up to $2 million for businesses and nonprofits affected by COVID-19. These loans have an interest rate of 3.75% for small businesses and 2.75% for nonprofit organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A governor must request access to this program for businesses in their state to be eligible. Additionally, a state must be considered a disaster area by the SBA or President. The SBA’s website states that “Small business owners in all U.S. states and territories are currently eligible to apply for a low-interest loan due to Coronavirus (COVID-19).” Those who are interested can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;apply here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Additional SBA Products&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SBA offers a variety of financing options during this time to help support small business operations. Businesses can access capital through programs including 7(a), Express, Community Advantage, 504, and Microloan. The SBA also offers exporting assistance, which can assist small businesses that directly or indirectly export, but face challenges with COVID-19. These programs include Export Express, Export Working Capital, and Export Trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 7(a) program is an all-inclusive option that provides loan amounts up to $5,000,000. Small businesses can use it for working capital, expansion, renovation, new construction, and more. An Express loan provides loans up to $350,000 for less than seven years. These are used for many of the same purposes as the 7(a) loan. A Community Advantage loan program allows lenders to help small businesses in underserved markets with a maximum loan size of $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eligible uses for these loans are the same as the 7(a) program. A 504 loan program aims to facilitate economic development, job creation, and job retention. These loans are limited to the acquisition, or eligible refinance, of fixed assets. Finally, a Microloan program makes loans through nonprofit lending organizations to underserved markets. These are authorized to use for working capital, supplies, machinery, equipment, and fixtures. However, a borrower can not use it for real estate. The maximum loan amount is $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deferring SBA Loans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 10, the SBA sent out a &lt;a href= &quot;https://www.sba.gov/document/information-notice-5000-20004-deferments-sba-7a-504-business-loans-microloans&quot; target=&quot; _blank&quot;&gt;notice&lt;/a&gt; which stated that 7(a) Lenders, 504 program Certified Development Companies (CDCs), and Microloan Intermediaries should work with existing borrowers experiencing cash flow issues as a result of the current economy. As long as a 7(a) loan has not yet sold on the secondary market, a lender may grant the borrower a deferment for six months. If a loan sells on the secondary market, then the lender may grant a one-time unilateral deferment for up to 90 days without consent from the investor (investor may be notified after the fact). However, investors must give their consent before any future deferments on the same loan. A CDC may defer either six payments on a loan or 20% of the original loan amount (whichever is a lower amount).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how small the amount, the SBA encourages at least some payment from the borrower during the deferment period. This shows that the payment source and method are the same, and also encourages the borrower to maintain a routine of consistent payment. With SBA loans, interest accumulates during the deferment period. Interest can be paid during deferment, in a lump sum at the end, or an increase in the loan after the deferment period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan deferments are a temporary solution, so businesses should have a detailed plan and optimized payment strategy in place when requesting a deferral. SBA regulations require lenders to assess a borrower’s financial information under prudent lending standards case-by-case to determine if the borrower’s cash flow problems are short-term or permanent. SBA lenders may issue borrowers a deferral request form, which requires the borrower to outline the reason for their deferral. Additionally, it will ask borrowers to specify the steps taken to lessen cash flow issues, address any cash flow issues not resulting from COVID-19, and provide their most recent financial information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has had quite an impact on the economy and has presented a variety of fiscal challenges for both businesses and individuals. However, assistance options continue to emerge from both the private and public sectors. As things continue to develop, it is critical to stay informed and utilize any programs that may be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As providers of essential services, healthcare professionals must continue going to work despite the recent “stay at home” orders mandated in multiple states all around the nation. With the coronavirus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51939392&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;now confirmed to be circulating in all 50 states,&lt;/a&gt; protecting your practice is more critical than ever. At this point, you can safely assume that your office will be exposed to coronavirus at some point or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to respond can help protect you, your staff, and your patients from the further spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking Preventive Measures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fguidance-business-response.htmll&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interim guidance for businesses and employers&lt;/a&gt; to prevent and control the spread of the novel coronavirus. These recommended strategies include encouraging sick employees to stay home and separating sick employees from the rest of the workplace. Employers should restrict workers with fevers of at least 100.4° F from coming in until they have been symptom-free for at least 24 hours without the help of fever-reducing or symptom-altering medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers may also need to alter sick leave policies to be more flexible and consistent with public health guidance. From now on, employers should encourage their employees to take off any time they need. Notes from healthcare providers should not be necessary to excuse an absence at this time. Any employee who displays symptoms of respiratory illness upon arrival or during the workday should be separated from others and sent home immediately. If the employee has exposed the workplace to COVID-19, pregnant workers and those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;at higher risk for the virus&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions) should not be asked to come into work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare professionals are at particular risk of interacting with infectious people and having their work environment contaminated. As such, they should take extra precautions accordingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;as laid out by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).&lt;/a&gt; Some of the regulations can apply to workers in all industries. For example, employees should take care to wash their hands frequently and properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involves scrubbing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content when soap is unavailable. If possible, practice social distancing by staying a minimum of six feet away from others at all times. Of course, in some client-facing practices, this is inapplicable advice. In any case, all healthcare employers should implement OSHA’s infection control strategies based on thorough hazard assessments and utilizing both engineering and administrative controls, along with safe work practices and personal protective equipment (PPE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Handling Patients Infected With the Novel Coronavirus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering controls consist of physically separating any infected patients (or those suspected to be infected) from other patients, ideally in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with proper ventilation. Acceptable alternatives include isolation tents, other portable containment structures, or even just a private room. Any air from the room must exhaust directly outside or, if recirculated, through a HEPA filter. Administrative controls consist of isolating any patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, those with confirmed cases should even be separated from those with suspected cases. Only a limited number of personnel should enter the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and only with the use of proper PPE. Conducting safe work practices means performing as many tasks as possible in areas away from any patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Do not remain in an isolation room for any longer than necessary. Limit opportunities for touch contamination. Touch clean body sites or surfaces before any dirty or heavily contaminated areas, and avoid touching anything unnecessarily with contaminated gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is vital to use proper PPE when exposed to a patient who may be infected with the novel coronavirus. The CDC and OSHA recommend healthcare professionals wear eyes/face protection, gowns, gloves, and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified, disposable N95 respirators or better. Do not touch a contaminated piece of PPE without gloves, and always wash hands with soap and water afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Operating Your Dental Practice During the Pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, providing essential services may look different for different types of healthcare professionals at this time. Recently, the American Dental Association (ADA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2020-archive/march/ada-develops-guidance-on-dental-emergency-nonemergency-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;issued its members with detailed guidance&lt;/a&gt; on what to consider dental emergencies and non-emergency dental care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADA has also recommended that dentists all over the country postpone any elective procedures to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. It is important to remember that these guidelines are not static and may continue to change throughout the pandemic. The ADA defines dental emergencies as those occurrences that are potentially life-threatening and call for immediate treatment to stop ongoing tissue bleeding or relieve severe pain or infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental emergencies may also involve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;browser-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cellulitis or a diffuse soft-tissue bacterial infection with intra- or extra-oral swelling potentially compromising the patient’s airway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facial trauma potentially compromising the patient’s airway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncontrolled bleeding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Following a New Protocol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from treating emergencies, dentists should also keep their doors open to patients seeking urgent dental care. Urgent dental care refers to dental conditions requiring immediate attention to relieve the patient of severe pain or risk of infection. These procedures should be treated as minimally invasively as possible and should be performed by dentists whenever possible to ease the load on hospital emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentists may exercise their own discretion on whether or not a patient requires immediate attention. However, they should be aware that continuing to perform routine or non-urgent dental procedures during the pandemic may contribute to the spread of disease or even lead to a backlash against their practice itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these trying times, we must all stay calm and do what we can to limit the spread of disease. Healthcare professionals must take extra precautions, and staff may need to be trained and retrained as necessary. Now more than ever, it is crucial that we all stand together.&lt;/p&gt;

In times like these, however, this may be easier said than done. The recent pandemic-designation of COVID-19 puts medical professionals in a particularly unique position. You may be asking yourself what to do if you run out of supplies, no matter what kind of medicine you practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protective Gear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As coronavirus continues to spread, it is crucial for medical professionals to keep themselves safe. After all, patients can only be treated if there is someone available to provide professional treatment. This is true regardless of practice type and whether or not the patient is known to have coronavirus. Currently, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt; recommends that healthcare workers wear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;browser-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goggles or face shield (for eye protection)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respirator or medical mask (ideally, an N95 respirator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gown (closed securely at the back)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gloves (pulled up over gown sleeves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, workers may wear powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) that cover the entire head. There is still much we do not yet know about COVID-19. As such, authorities recommend taking higher-level protections until more information on the virus’s transmissibility is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;N95 Respirator Shortage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitals and other healthcare professionals generally only order as many supplies as they anticipate they will need. This, in conjunction with a slew of other factors amid the coronavirus outbreak, has led to a nationwide shortage of N95 respirators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare professionals should also advise their patients not to wear respirators or surgical masks unless they are already sick with coronavirus, as this may further contribute to the shortage. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/healthcare-supply-ppe.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;For most healthy people,&lt;/a&gt; wearing respirators and surgical masks will not do much to prevent contracting COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rationing N95 Respirators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the shortage continues to worsen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/release-stockpiled-N95.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the CDC has approved&lt;/a&gt; using N95 respirators for “repeated close contact encounters with several patients,” despite being marked as single-use. They may also be used beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, alternative options are available. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsha.org/wp-content/uploads/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; recommends using surgical masks to protect against droplets when N95 respirators are unavailable. Such protection is inadequate, however, when performing aerosol-generating procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Supply Shortages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/03/us-america-has-fraction-medical-supplies-it-needs-to-combat-coronavirus/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In an interview with National Geographic&lt;/a&gt;, senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Center Eric Toner states, “In terms of the amount masks, gowns, gloves, [and] respirators that would be needed.” Toner adds, “I don’t see any reason to think that we would need a different number of those things than we do for a severe pandemic flu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s models for a potential public health emergency estimate that American healthcare workers will need &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_1/S42/356585&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7,000 to 11,000 mechanical ventilators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_1/S42/356585&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;100 to 400 million surgical masks&lt;/a&gt; for the least to most severe scenarios, respectively. However, anticipating actual supply and demand is difficult when the outbreak’s attack rate is still undetermined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Healthcare Professionals Can Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of a possible lockdown, healthcare professionals should make sure to supply their patients with a sufficient amount of prescription refills as necessary. It is crucial to take proper precautions and not skip any necessary preventative measures out of fear of running out. Order any masks, gowns, gloves, and respirators while possible, along with any other supplies you anticipate needing. Ration out any supplies carefully and reuse what can be safely reused. If your N95 supplies are running low or you have run out entirely, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;follow the CDC protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the U.S. government has incentivized manufacturers to increase the production of surgical masks and respirators by &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1811316/us-will-buy-excess-coronavirus-face-masks-to-encourage-production/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;promising to buy any that are left over once demand has run dry&lt;/a&gt;. The Strategic National Stockpile, which has a record of proven success during previous epidemics, has also asked manufacturers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.sam.gov/opp/84a00a52e4e243318a0d2496dc431e36/view?keywords=masks&amp;#038;sort=-modifiedDate&amp;#038;index=&amp;#038;is_active=true&amp;#038;page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;submit data on their inventories of personal protective equipment&lt;/a&gt;. If necessary, the stockpile may be able to supply healthcare workers with any antibiotics (both oral and antibiotic) and any other medical equipment that could prove useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that these are stressful times. You want to keep your practice afloat, treat your patients successfully, and protect yourself from the virus all at once. Staying informed and taking steps to prepare may be able to help lessen your anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;

If you have seen Johns<a class="moretag" href="/interpreting-the-data-on-covid-19/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/interpreting-the-data-on-covid-19/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/interpreting-the-data-on-covid-19/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2020 07:38:46 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It can be overwhelming to try to navigate all the news concerning the coronavirus pandemic. If you have seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Johns Hopkins University’s heat map of coronavirus COVID-19 global cases,&lt;/a&gt; you may be feeling lost and confused about interpreting the actual and logarithmic data, along with the daily cases reported. The high numbers of confirmed cases and deaths may seem intimidating, but what do they really mean in the grand scheme of things?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Actual vs. Logarithmic Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Johns Hopkins University graph for actual data, data is spaced out by every 20,000 cases. In other words, the chart is spaced out linearly and evenly. This is known as an arithmetic graph, where equal distances represent equal amounts. Most people are most familiar with this type of chart because of its straightforward nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JHU graph for logarithmic data, however, spaces out data from 10 to 1,000 to 100,000. Instead of representing equal amounts, equal distances represent equal rates. In this case, each distance represents 10%. This makes it more useful in comparing rates of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Daily Rates of COVID-19 Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to interpret the JHU graph for actual data as proof that the daily rates of (1) novel coronavirus growth outside of mainland China and (2) total recovered worldwide have been skyrocketing since February. Looking at this graph may be disheartening, as it seems to indicate an unstoppable daily uptick in novel coronavirus cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the logarithmic data shows us that the daily growth rates of COVID-19 outside of mainland China are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-data-do-not-support-global-alarmism-by-anatole-kaletsky-2020-03&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;actually slowing down.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interpreting COVID-19 Maps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may also find it panic-inducing to look at JHU’s map. It is crucial to remember that the data presented does not give viewers an idea of the number of cases relative to the population. In other words, the map is using actual data. By failing to list population numbers and focusing only on COVID-19-related statistics, the map may render viewers unable to establish a baseline for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JHU’s map partially compensates for this by implementing proportional symbols in marking each region, meaning larger circles represent larger numbers of cumulative confirmed cases. Thus, viewers may be able to see which countries are more affected than others — though not proportionately so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Significance of Current Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual data suggests that cases exploded in mainland China from mid-January to early February before finally beginning to flatten out in mid-February. Additionally, the graph indicates that the total recovery rate has been on the rise. Logarithmic data confirms both of these assumptions while simultaneously showing that recovery rates may be leveling out — likely correlated with the overall slowing of new COVID-19 diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this indicates that flattening the curve is still very possible, provided individuals &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stick to necessary precautions like social distancing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the high numbers reported in COVID-19 statistics may be intimidating, they must be taken in context. Understanding how to correctly interpret the data on COVID-19 is imperative in reducing sensationalism and panic. Staying calm and keeping a clear head can help aid you in taking the preventative steps needed to keep both yourself and those around you safe.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only have traders seen the effects of the virus, but<a class="moretag" href="/how-covid-19-may-affect-the-healthcare-industry/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-covid-19-may-affect-the-healthcare-industry/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-covid-19-may-affect-the-healthcare-industry/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2020 08:01:10 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to greatly impact the global economy. Not only have traders seen the effects of the virus, but now the overall U.S. economy is seeing them too. On Monday, all three major stock indexes fell at least 12%, and The Federal Reserve cut interest rates. As cases rise, more businesses are shutting their doors to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healthcare industry is one of the economic sectors affected by the outbreak. This pandemic may put considerable stress on hospitals, medical practices, and health care workers. It is difficult to accurately predict how the system will hold up under the potential influx of patients. Things like revenue, supplies, staffing, billing, and resources will likely be affected. How it reacts will likely impact future changes to the U.S. healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes and Risks For Healthcare Workers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that they care for infected individuals, medical workers are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 than those in other fields. As hospital and doctor visits for the virus rise, it could pose a greater risk for healthcare workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends following their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/steps-to-prepare.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;procedure and guidelines&lt;/a&gt; to help prevent those in the healthcare industry and their patients from getting sick. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has also published a detailed article about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;working during the outbreak of this virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;One subset of the medical sector that is benefiting from COVID-19 is telehealth. Telehealth is a category of healthcare services that provides doctor visits remotely. In recent weeks, telehealth companies and their affiliated medical practices have experienced an increase in business and attention. In anticipation of this, Congress passed a bill which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/telehealth-benefits-medicare-are-lifeline-patients-during-coronavirus-outbreak&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;waived telehealth service restrictions to seniors on Medicare.&lt;/a&gt; This could be an effective way to limit exposure and mitigate the spread of the virus while still receiving medical care.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;h2&gt;Impact On Dental Practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 outbreak also affects dentists and their staff. On Monday, the American Dental Association (ADA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2020-archive/march/ada-recommending-dentists-postpone-elective-procedures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommended that dentists postpone elective procedures&lt;/a&gt; for at least three weeks. This was outlined in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. The ADA specified that dental offices should focus on treating patients with urgent and emergency cases so that those with these levels of dental issues will not be placing additional stress on already overworked hospitals. Additionally, the CDC has issued &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/summary-infection-prevention-practices/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; to dental offices for preventing the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19 Funding Bill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President signed an $8.3 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6074/text&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emergency spending bill&lt;/a&gt; on Friday aimed at treating and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Over $3 billion of the bill fund went to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use flexibly. $950 million went to fund state and local health sectors for things like staffing and other critical needs. Additionally, $300 million went toward vaccine and treatment research, development, and production. Lastly, $1.25 billion went to international activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dental practices, medical practices, and businesses will likely see several changes during the COVID-19 outbreak. While these changes may present new challenges, companies can implement changes of their own to help navigate the changing landscape. It is vital to remain informed and utilize resources provided by the government and other organizations so that businesses can better adapt to the COVID-19 environment.&lt;/p&gt;

With its widespread nature, governments and organizations<a class="moretag" href="/managing-loans-amid-coronavirus/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/managing-loans-amid-coronavirus/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/managing-loans-amid-coronavirus/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 07:56:21 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization announced Wednesday that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814474930/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coronavirus (COVID-19) is officially a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. With its widespread nature, governments and organizations are implementing protective measures. Many are restricting their travel, working from home, and avoiding large groups of people. These things, and other factors, are presenting businesses with a variety of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question many business owners are asking themselves is, “How will I be able to manage my business’s finances during this time?” Managing loans or just keeping a business afloat during a lull or shutdown period brought on by COVID-19 can be challenging and confusing. Fortunately, there are some ways businesses can plan and navigate this turbulent environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common Issues Businesses May Encounter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has unfortunately presented businesses with a list of potential problems. While it is important not to panic, it is just as important to be aware of some of the possible factors. Access to capital may be the biggest concern for businesses. Things like payroll and inventory are affected by market fluctuations, so businesses should prepare by assessing their access options as soon as possible so that they can adjust accordingly. Fortunately, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has rolled out an assistance plan for small businesses affected by COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are additional factors to consider. These include workforce capacity, employee wellbeing, inventory, supply chain, insurance coverage issues, changing market demand, marketing, and cleanup. It is critical to contact insurance providers and suppliers to get a read on the situation. Additionally, business owners and managers should be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;developing contingency plans&lt;/a&gt; for the factors above, whether the overall situation becomes worse, stays the same, or starts to improve. Doing so will mitigate the collateral damage leveed on your business by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decreasing Revenue With Oncoming Loan Payments and Other Expenses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant potential challenge for companies is losing business while still having to make payments on loans, rent, and other expenses. While this may seem like an insurmountable situation at first, there are steps people can take to mitigate some of the damage to their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FDIC and Banks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 9, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdic.gov/coronavirus/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; that they are working with federal and state banking agencies to help customers who are affected by COVID-19. Additionally, the FDIC stated that regulatory agencies are encouraging financial institutions to work with customers. This is potentially good news for those businesses facing less revenue and mounting payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, companies can reach out to their issuers, and inquire if they may be willing to adjust their existing payment plan. Also, if a business has an emergency savings fund, it may need to start dipping into it until it resolves payment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The White House and SBA Assistance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has signed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-taken-unprecedented-steps-respond-coronavirus-protect-health-safety-americans/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;economic assistance package&lt;/a&gt; into effect to help assist both businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. This comes as one of the numerous steps the federal government has recently taken to deal with the mounting situation in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the federal government has instructed the SBA to supply affordable loans that will assist businesses and workers affected by the outbreak. Congress is in talks to fund the program with an additional $50 billion. The SBA has also provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sba.gov/page/guidance-businesses-employers-plan-respond-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19#section-header-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resources and guidance for businesses&lt;/a&gt; on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the situation develops, so too may the potential challenges for businesses. Owners and workers can better navigate these hurdles by adopting a proactive approach, by utilizing government assistance, and by continually staying informed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have provided href=&amp;#8221;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html&amp;#8221;_blank&amp;#8221;&gt;interim guidance for businesses and workers during the COVID-19 outbreak&lt;/a&gt; on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

Many Americans are unsure how coronavirus&amp;#8217; new designation as a pandemic will affect the way they conduct business. It is important to know what to expect and have a plan in place in case you are placed on lockdown. You should also know what to do if you need to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Lockdowns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niaid.nih.gov/global/emergency-lockdown&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt; (NIH), lockdown procedures are necessary when an immediate threat presents itself to building occupants. During these instances, it becomes more dangerous for occupants to leave the building than it is for them to stay in secured areas. With the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens may be placed under lockdown if disease-causing contaminants have been released into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21172390/italy-lockdown-coronavirus-expansion-lombardy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;entire country of Italy is on lockdown&lt;/a&gt; to prevent further spread of coronavirus. Consequently, Italian citizens are not allowed to assemble in public or do anything other than stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lockdown Response Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one thing to do during a lockdown is to stay calm, as panicking will only make things worse. If placed under lockdown, individuals should secure themselves at home as soon as possible. They should not leave until directed otherwise by emergency personnel, as doing so will increase the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow any directions given by the relevant authorities until and after being given the all-clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Taking Your Practice Remote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many business owners may want to take their practice remote in anticipation of a lockdown. Doing so seamlessly involves time and planning. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90475330/8-strategies-to-set-up-remote-work-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a CEO writing for Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;, it all &amp;#8220;starts from the top.&amp;#8221; In other words, business owners should lead by example, making themselves present and available on various online tools and channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there is less non-verbal communication involved in remote work, it is crucial to reinforce the company&amp;#8217;s missions and expectations. At the same time, creating and promoting a digital company culture is critical. To do so, business owners must choose the right tools (such as Slack or Google Hangouts) and keep them in constant use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the example of The United States Office of Personnel Management brought up in an article by The Washington Post, another option is to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-now-wants-hundreds-of-thousands-of-federal-workers-to-be-ready-to-telework-to-limit-coronavirus-spread/2020/03/10/ea284a12-620b-11ea-b3fc-7841686c5c57_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;issue ­laptops and grant access to computer networks.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Remote Work Strategies for Employees&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, employees should also be aware of the new expectations they will be accountable for while working in a remote work environment. Try to prepare for working from home as soon as possible. This involves taking note of any software, information, bookmarks, phone numbers, and anything else that might be necessary to carry out essential job duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, set up a designated, separate workspace at home, if possible. Many workers find this helps them strike an appropriate work-life balance. It is crucial to communicate as clearly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers should set up a culture of responsiveness and keep colleagues updated on any deadlines or progress they have made throughout the day. Additionally, those who need to take care of pets or children should be transparent about their schedule.

&lt;h3&gt;Work Goes On&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proper planning, you can ensure that your business has a seamless transition into working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can lessen your chances of contracting the coronavirus by taking preventive measures and being prepared for a lockdown. Though feelings of fear and anxiety are natural, it is crucial to stay calm.&lt;/p&gt;

You may be asking yourself what you should do to prepare for COVID-19. There are many things to consider in the wake of a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a plan in place may assuage any anxieties you have about contracting the virus and protecting yourself from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consider Your Household&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All household members should consult with each other to determine what will be done if there is an outbreak in the community. Some populations are more at risk for suffering complications from coronavirus than others. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/get-your-household-ready-for-COVID-19.html&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), vulnerable groups include older adults and those with chronic health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or a loved one falls into one of these categories, please consult with a healthcare professional for guidelines one how to reduce the chances of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Food to Stock Up On&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ready.gov/pandemic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;, individuals should store a two-week supply of water and food before a pandemic strikes. Individuals can shop for the same foods they normally would, provided they are nutritious and do not have a short shelf-life. Frozen fruits and vegetables are best, as are nutritious non-perishables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that there is an adequate supply of any needed prescription drugs. Try to get a 30-day supply, if possible. Other health supplies (like nonprescription drugs, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins) should also be sufficiently stocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blogimg/how-to-prepare-for-corvid-inline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How should I prepare for the Coronavirus?&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Supplies You Need&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it is essential to stock up on needed supplies in case of emergency, individuals should also keep in mind that hoarding is not the answer. Across the globe, some stores have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/health/toilet-paper-shortages-novel-coronavirus-trnd/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;undergoing a notorious shortage of toilet paper&lt;/a&gt; due to the coronavirus crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Department of Homeland Security&amp;#8217;s recommendation is that people have enough supplies to last them for two weeks at home. Prioritize basic toiletries and cleaning supplies, along with any needed supplies for children or pets. &amp;#8220;Panic buying&amp;#8221; may lead to a shortage of supplies for others, thus increasing a community&amp;#8217;s overall vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Real Threat of COVID-19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Still, the organization is optimistic that the virus can be &amp;#8220;suppressed and controlled&amp;#8221; with the proper planning and investment of resources. We do not yet know how severe the illness can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/health-information/coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; states that &amp;#8220;For the majority of people, the immediate risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the right preventive measures and having a plan in place, however, may help lessen any personal impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preparation Can Be Prevention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just hearing the word &amp;#8220;pandemic&amp;#8221; can be intimidating. Planning for a potential quarantine can be a proactive way to lessen any feelings of fear and lessen your chances of contracting the disease. It is important to remember that one individual&amp;#8217;s actions may help protect an entire community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking preventive measures may also help you feel less stressed about potentially catching coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

The question is no longer &amp;#8220;will it hit your neighborhood.&amp;#8221; Now, you should be asking &amp;#8220;by when.&amp;#8221; Like many others, you would probably like to know what to do when handling day-to-day situations to avoid infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among an onslaught of questions we hear, one that appears often is whether it is safe to even go outside. Here are a few tips other medical professionals are offering in regard to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preventing the Illness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that during an outbreak of COVID-19, the main focus of a lockdown is to slow the spread of it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, states that &lt;a href= &quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html&quot; target=&quot; _blank&quot;&gt;COVID-19 is spread&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Between people who are in close contact with one another,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&amp;#8221;
The CDC adds that many places where a large number of people gather may shut down during a lockdown. This can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;browser-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community centers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offices or places of work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movie theaters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large events/gatherings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blogimg/exercise-caution-corvid-inline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Be careful in large crowds or parks&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1987&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while going outside will not immediately mean a person contracts COVID-19, that does not mean that people should spend too much time outside. In fact, limiting one&amp;#8217;s time outside can help decrease the risk of contracting COVID-19 from another person. Unless there is a national warning to remain indoors put into effect, people can go outside when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Steps to Take When Outside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though people are able to go outside, there are precautionary steps people can take to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frequently Wash Hands with Soap and Water&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The &lt;a href= &quot;https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html&quot; target=&quot; _blank&quot;&gt;United States Department of Labor&lt;/a&gt; and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration gives details on controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the office space. The Department of Labor states that regardless of specific exposure risks, it is crucial to &amp;#8220;Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This advice not only applies to employees in the workspace but to people of all ages in any setting. It is crucial to wash the hands and decrease the risk of contracting the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid sharing food or drinks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether someone is going out for a meal or with friends, do not share food or drinks. The CDC states that &amp;#8220;Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms.&amp;#8221; People who do not display signs of COVID-19 can still be contagious. Avoid sharing food and drinks to decrease the chance of spreading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clean surfaces when in public&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before using a surface, such as a table at a restaurant or bench at a park, it is crucial to keep the surfaces clean. Ensure the surface was wiped down before using it to prevent the risk of interacting with germs and potential areas that are contaminated with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid large community events and gatherings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases of a virus such as COVID-19 spreading, public gatherings and events may close down. Schools may close to prevent the risk of the virus spreading through children. Community centers, churches, movie theaters, and more may temporarily close. In the cases of colleges closing, some may have students work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place of employment may do the same thing, choosing to have employees complete work remotely and not come into the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seek the Information You Need&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your health, it is crucial to seek information from a credible source. If you have any concerns about COVID-19, reach out to your medical professional for more information. While outside, exercise caution in interaction with other people and limit the amount of time you spend outside. It is important to note that protocol for dealing with COVID-19 and going outside may change in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review credible online sources and news stations for current updates. If you believe that you or a loved one has symptoms, contact your medical provider for instructions on treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

Just seven days later, the case was confirmed to be related to a novel coronavirus: known now as COVID-19. By the end of January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a global health emergency. Then, on Wednesday, the organization moved the status of the virus to a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the first reported cases of the disease in Wuhan, there are now a total of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;127,863 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; (1,323 in the U.S.) and 4,718 deaths from the disease worldwide, according to John Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;What Is Coronavirus?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to the WHO&lt;/a&gt;, coronavirus is a family of viruses that cause a variety of illnesses, from the common cold to SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. These viruses are zoonotic, meaning that they pass from animals to people. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, the official name of the coronavirus currently spreading is COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of COVID-19 can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;browser-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mild to severe respiratory issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is considered a novel virus, the word “novel” indicating that the virus is a previously undiscovered strain of coronavirus. It is a respiratory illness which spreads from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Does It Spread?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 appears to be highly transmittable. People can catch the virus from others who have the virus, even before the infected individual is showing symptoms. The disease can spread between people who are within six feet of each other, and through droplets created by an infected individual who coughs or sneezes. Although it is not the primary route, people can acquire the virus by touching an infected surface, followed by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aspect of COVID-19 that may make it an especially spreadable virus is how it can transmit between people before the infected individual even shows any symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms are mild, so the infected individual may spread the virus before realizing they are sick. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001737?query=featured_home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; reported that COVID-19 is at peak infectiousness just as the individual begins to feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who Is at Risk for Severe Illness From Infection?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those over the age of 60 and people who have chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, and cancer are at a greater risk of developing severe symptoms from COVID-19. For those over the age of 80, the mortality rate stands at 15%, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173157/coronavirus-health-effects-age-covid-risk-diabetes-hypertension-disease-isolation” target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WHO report that pooled over 72,314 cases in China&lt;/a&gt;. That said, it is difficult to accurately identify all of the factors that leave people susceptible to developing serious illness at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to be no evidence that children are more likely to catch the disease. Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/children-faq.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; that severe complications from COVID-19 in children are uncommon. However, disease spreading can happen quicker among children because of frequent exposure to germ-rich areas like schools. The CDC also recommends that parents teach their children to have good hygiene practices and keep them up to date on all vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; What COVID-19 is Like and When to See a Doctor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Researchers found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150748&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nearly 99% of individuals&lt;/a&gt; developed signs of COVID-19 within 14 days of initial infection. The severity of the symptoms depends partly on the person’s immune system and age; however, those infected may experience respiratory symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath. Additionally, the virus may induce a fever. Cases can present symptoms that range from mild to severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals recommend that those who are sick with any illness like the cold or flu stay home. If a fever accompanies the symptoms progress and, they recommend you call your healthcare provider. If you have symptoms after recently traveling to an area infected with COVID-19, or have come in close contact with someone who has the virus, the CDC recommends you find help from a medical professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Prevent the Spread of Covid-19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the WHO recommends for you stay home if you are ill. It is critical to follow other guidelines like covering your mouth with the crease of your elbow when coughing and sneezing into disposable tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth, as the virus can enter the body this way. Unless you have COVID-19, or are caring for a person with a suspected COVID-19 infection, the WHO does not recommend wearing a facemask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO does recommend washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water. People should also maintain social distancing, maintaining at least three feet of distance between yourself and other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, stay informed on the ongoing development of COVID-19 and contact your personal healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about how to protect yourself from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

However, they may change their mind and find another practice when they are not greeted with adequate customer service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the text below, we delve deeper into how proper phone etiquette has the power to book more new patients and earn more referrals for your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critical Importance of Front Desk Staff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front desk serves as the communication hub of your practice. Patients typically spend more time interacting with the support staff at a medical practice than anyone else. In many ways, the waiting room influences patient engagement more than the exam room. Only four percent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/patients-no-1-complaint-front-desk-staff.html&quot;&gt;patient complaints&lt;/a&gt; focused on the quality of medical care, with 96 percent of complaints related to customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Impact on Patient Perception of Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient satisfaction affects your ratings with insurance plans, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/online-reputation-management&quot;&gt;online reviews&lt;/a&gt;, and the likelihood that patients will return. When it comes to satisfaction, patients focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicaleconomics.com/business/3-ways-improve-patient-experience?utm_source=bibblio_recommendation&quot;&gt;a few key areas&lt;/a&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Poor experiences with office staff&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Impersonal interactions, where they feel more like a number than a person&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Scheduling difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Poor communication with the practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsatisfied patients are less likely to remain at the practice. One survey reports at least a third of patients would switch to another provider after just one negative experience with the office staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Influence on Patient Referrals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When patients have an unpleasant experience with a service provider or company, then they are more inclined to speak poorly about that service provider and not likely to make a referral. In a recent industry survey, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/patient-engagement-health-care-consumer-survey.html&quot;&gt;39 percent&lt;/a&gt; of respondents said a practice&amp;#8217;s reputation is one of the top four factors considered when looking for a new doctor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another one-fourth listed a friend or family member&amp;#8217;s recommendation and 20 percent cited high user reviews as deciding factors. Patients&amp;#8217; opinions of your practice, then, play a critical role in gaining new patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suggested Best Practices to Improve Patient Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many opportunities for improvement exist. One often overlooked area is how your practice answers (or does not answer) phone calls. As the first entry point into a practice for most patients, your phone system plays an important role. Inefficiencies and inadequacies in your phone system can lead to caller irritation, staff frustration, lost calls and lost patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Availability of Live Person to Answer Calls Promptly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as more healthcare interactions move online, 88 percent of healthcare appointments are still made over the phone. Phone calls should be answered by a live person. If someone calls your office during typical business hours (Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., which allows for busy people to make calls before or after work, or during a lunch break), staff should be available to answer that call. If someone is calling to schedule a first appointment, reaching voicemail instead of a person may lead to that potential new patient simply calling another practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Training of Front Desk Staff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All staff in your practice require customer service skills, but your front desk and phone answering staff especially need the proper training. They need to understand the important role they play in the patient experience and your expectations when engaging with the public. Courteous language, a friendly demeanor, and a patient-centric orientation are some of the training topics needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Greetings to Use When Answering the Phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While answering the phone is essential, how the staff answers the phone is even more so. If staff are abrupt, speak with a flat tone, or act rudely, then patients will feel unwelcome. The greeting staff use when answering a phone call is influential. Scripts can be helpful in guiding staff on proper phone etiquette.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, here is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dentaleconomics.com/practice/patient-communication-and-patient-financing/article/14039590/dental-practices-must-make-a-good-impression-with-friendly-phone-etiquette&quot;&gt;outstanding greeting&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#8220;Thank you for choosing Premier Dental. This is Paula. With whom am I speaking? Hello, Stephanie. How may I assist you today?&amp;#8221; This greeting thanks the caller for choosing your practice. Giving and getting names forms a personal connection. The last sentence provides a patient-centric, service orientation and projects a professional image.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First impressions matter. Don&amp;#8217;t let your first also be your last.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Top 7 Tips for Doctors to Boost Their Online Reputation]]></title><description><![CDATA[Online reputation for doctors has become a critical component to a practice&#8217;s success.

Whether proactive or reactive, doctor reputation management uses techniques to boost a doctor&amp;#8217;s reputation online. Are you recovering from a malpractice lawsuit or negative press coverage? Have you received too many negative patient reviews? Or perhaps you have very little online presence at all? Try some (or all) of these top tips for doctors who want to improve and manage their online reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Request Patients Give Google/Yelp Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/how-patients-use-online-reviews/&quot;&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; found patients&amp;#8217; use of online reviews continues to increase. Ninety-four percent of respondents reported using online reviews to evaluate doctors, and nearly three-fourths (72 percent) say they use online reviews as their first step in finding a new doctor. Establishing a robust online presence in terms of reviews, then, is good practice.&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, if you are suffering from negative online reviews, then more reviews overall will help. You can flag negative reviews, but you can dilute their impact by encouraging patients to leave positive reviews. Since nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/factsheet&quot;&gt;80 percent of Yelp reviewers&lt;/a&gt; leave five-, four-, or three-star ratings, your patients&amp;#8217; reviews are more likely to lean toward the positive end of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;
More reviews also factor into Google&amp;#8217;s algorithms and are likely to improve &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091&quot;&gt;your business&amp;#8217; local rankings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Respond to All Online Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy percent of respondents to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/how-patients-use-online-reviews/&quot;&gt;a recent survey&lt;/a&gt; claimed that providers responding publicly to online reviews is “very” or “moderately important.” So, responding in a timely, professional manner to online patient reviews, whether positive or negative, is a key component of most doctor reputation management strategies. For one, responding to reviews demonstrates that you care about your patients. For two, addressing negative reviews helps neutralize its impact, and the reviewer is more likely to retract or edit. Since some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Yelp-reviews-privacy-laws-hamstring-doctors-9975030.php?psid=h62n1&quot;&gt;medical professionals report&lt;/a&gt; experiencing about a 30 percent loss in business after negative Yelp reviews, you should not take bad reviews lightly. And for three, Google&amp;#8217;s algorithms assign higher rankings when businesses respond to users&amp;#8217; reviews.&lt;br /&gt;
Simply responding to patient reviews, though, is insufficient and could backfire if not done correctly. To remain compliant with HIPAA privacy standards, you must not confirm that the reviewer is a patient. Your answer must be vague about the patient or specific situations, but you can be specific about your office policies or standard operating procedures. Yelp suggests you privately contact reviewers about concerns. You can contact reviewers with direct messaging if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://writers.scripted.com/writer/jobs/28472a5c-ac9f-4751-b969-91a6001ea0b0/www.biz.yelp.com&quot;&gt;claim your business on Yelp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Avoid responding when emotional, or have a designated staff or online reputation management partner respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintain an Up-to-Date Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When done properly, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/the-study/start-new-year-off-right-part-functioning-website-practice/&quot;&gt;doctor-focused website&lt;/a&gt; provides several benefits. The website likely will appear first or near the top of a Google search for your name. A website should provide all pertinent information about you, your values, your experience, and your practice. It is your personal digital forum, and you own how you are presented. Even if people searching find less than stellar reviews, your website likely gives a positive first impression, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write Blog Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write blog posts directed to your patients. A regularly updated blog helps you rank higher in Google search results and brings more patients. Great blog content that ranks high for specific keywords drives more clients to your website. Through your blog you can showcase your expertise. Your blog also provides a forum for you to discuss your services.&lt;br /&gt;
Also write guest blog posts for other sites when possible. Not only does doing so help establish thought leadership and generate referral opportunities. Creating new content on other sites is the easiest way to bury negative reviews or press coverage. &lt;br /&gt;
Claim Your Google Business Listing &lt;br /&gt;
Claiming your business listing on Google, providing business information, and updating your details in a timely manner in &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091&quot;&gt;Google My Business &lt;/a&gt;can help your business’s local ranking on Google. This enhances your business&amp;#8217; presence in Search and Maps. When users search for your name or sometimes just your specialty, they are more likely to see your business listing in local search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep Profiles / Listings Updated and Accurate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to keep your online information consistent and updated across profiles, locations, and directories, such as Google My Business, Yelp, Facebook, and Apple Maps. Consistent and accurate listings on multiple sites and search engines not only makes you appear engaged and improves Google page ranking, it reduces frustration of patients when trying to learn about your practice. Check for accuracy of hours, addresses, and contact details especially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actively Use Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-two percent of people in the United States regularly use at least one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/&quot;&gt;social media platform&lt;/a&gt;, especially Facebook. If you are not actively engaging on social media, then you are missing countless opportunities to interact with existing and potential clients. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/social-media-seo/196185/&quot;&gt;social media activity impacts &lt;/a&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s search results rankings. Consequently, creating and using social media accounts that post regularly strengthens your online reputation.&lt;br /&gt;
You also can use social media to tune into current issues important to your patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jmir.org/2019/3/e10170/&quot;&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that patients are more likely to consult with physicians who show greater effort. Online this means providers who regularly revise their information, publish educational articles for patients, and answer questions posed by patients. Doctors who proactively manage their online reputation, then, increase their opportunities for attracting new patients or maintaining relationships with existing clients.Though your business operates in face-to-face encounters, your virtual interactions significantly impact your practice&amp;#8217;s reputation and the likelihood of expanding your patient base.&lt;br /&gt;
Boosting your online reputation requires targeted strategies, routine review, and timely responses. For many doctors, partnering with a third-party expert makes the most sense. To explore strategies specific to your needs, contact &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/contact&quot;&gt;Doctor Genius &lt;/a&gt;to start the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Doctor Genius Joins Over 500 Exhibitors at the CDA Presents The Art and Science of Dentistry 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[The California Dental Association, CDA, is presenting The Art of Science and Dentistry at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim,<a class="moretag" href="/doctor-genius-joins-over-500-exhibitors-at-the-cda-presents-the-art-and-science-of-dentistry/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/doctor-genius-joins-over-500-exhibitors-at-the-cda-presents-the-art-and-science-of-dentistry/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/doctor-genius-joins-over-500-exhibitors-at-the-cda-presents-the-art-and-science-of-dentistry/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2019 17:47:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The California Dental Association, CDA, is presenting The Art of Science and Dentistry at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, CA, from Thursday, May 16th through Saturday, May 18th, 2019. This event is a weekend full of the latest advancements in dentistry with courses on effective dental practice techniques, over 550 exhibitors from all areas of the dental market and a plethora of speakers &amp;#8211; among which, Doctor Genius will be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Offering the Marketing Solutions Every Dental Practice Needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental practices can greatly benefit from having a strong online presence and an active website. Doctor Genius not only offers professionals a chance for a stronger online presence, but we also keep the website active by using key marketing techniques to help professionals extend their reach online. Doctor Genius will be at booth #244 at the CDA event to go over the marketing solutions and available technologies. Here is a list summarizing our services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We create custom content and personalize websites for each client. At Doctor Genius, the client can feel safe knowing that the website contains all of his or her services in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Branding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also deliver effective brand strategies to help give practices a major edge in competitive markets. We will use the proper branding to highlight the client’s services and areas of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Search Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can narrow down the list of keywords to the words that most frequently appear in people’s searches online. With a list of keywords for each client, we can work to yield higher numbers of new patient inquiries into one’s practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Review Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can highlight positive and easily-readable reviews of a client’s practice on the website. After reading the reviews, patients will be more likely to consider a practice for dental care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hyper-Local Targeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will increase the focus of a client’s website to the local area and enhance the client’s reach to possible patients there. By targeting the local area, we can help the client rank higher online in the local area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not only help monitor and create regular posts for the client’s social media pages, but we will also ensure that the social media pages remain active and engage followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Voice Search Optimization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will properly optimize your website for voice search as Google is shifting from a search engine to an “answer engine.” Voice search drastically improves user experience – and because of that, by the year 2020, 50% of all online searches will be made through voice search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With HIPPA compliant voice technology features, devices such as Amazon Alexa have developed their technology to allow patients, caregivers and healthcare members to provide better patient experiences. You might be asking, “why?” The answer is that these voice features help patients perform healthcare-related tasks, access their health data and interact with their providers. Voice search optimization can certainly impact practice revenue, improving brand awareness, and attracting more new patients online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason your Healthcare SEO strategy should continuously refine and evolve is because of how different text and voice searches actually are. Since users of voice search are essentially having a conversation with their personal assistant device, your content should fit this context. Answering questions promptly and accurately is key for ranking but most importantly, will further enhance your online digital marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Start with a Strong Foot Forward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We help clients build trustworthy relationships with their patients by providing strong online content. We also provide ranking reports and help maximize the client’s website for better results. Working with Doctor Genius, clients can start their practice by putting a strong foot forward with a professional, mobile-first website.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s why&amp;#8230;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;In 2016, a study based on 1 million Google search results confirmed that content, backlinks, and site speed were the &lt;strong&gt;3 mo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;st important factors to determine first-page ranking. &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking&quot;&gt;Backlinko&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;So our Genius Team went back to the drawing board and developed a strategy that would certainly be ahead of the curve, benefiting our clients in the long-term. As your website&lt;i&gt; is&lt;/i&gt; the catalyst for new patient inquiries, we forecasted a major industry change approaching quickly and we&amp;#8217;re happy we did!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;In 2017, we began creating new and improved frameworks that focused primarily on site quality as well as what potential challenges might arise in this ever-evolving digital world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;In August 2018, Google released its most significant update toward the healthcare industry, &lt;b&gt;affecting nearly 40% of all medical websites.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1778&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/t-google-medic-update-pie-chart2-1533758913-300x183.png&quot; alt=&quot;SEO traffic sources graph&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/t-google-medic-update-pie-chart2-1533758913-300x183.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/t-google-medic-update-pie-chart2-1533758913-177x108.png 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/t-google-medic-update-pie-chart2-1533758913.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I know if my practice has been affected?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;No worries&lt;/em&gt;, we&amp;#8217;ll give you the inside track on exactly what we&amp;#8217;ve done to secure our client&amp;#8217;s current performance and how we&amp;#8217;ve better prepared them for any future turbulence.To prepare for this major change, our team implemented a comprehensive strategy that would protect our clients from any detrimental ranking downturns or damages to their overall online presence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;As Google fully deployed the “Medic Update,” Doctor Genius found that our client&amp;#8217;s were positively impacted due to proper marketing methods equipped with a well-executed online strategy. Whereas many other Healthcare Professionals are still experiencing the repercussions of this massive global update, attempting to repair and restore their on and offline visibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s to come?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;Let us break it down for you:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;By 2020 &lt;b&gt;50%&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; searches will be voice searches. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/just-say-it-future-search-voice-personal-digital-assistants/1392459&quot;&gt;Comscore&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;Voice search results are significantly more likely to use HTTPS than other websites ranking on Google’s first page. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/voice-search-seo-study&quot;&gt;Backlinko&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t worry, our sites are encrypted and secure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The average word count of a voice search result page is 2,312 words. &lt;/b&gt;Therefore, Google tends to source voice search answers from long-form content. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/voice-search-seo-study&quot;&gt;Backlinko&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;On average, our client&amp;#8217;s service pages contain 2,500 words or more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;Long-form content provides the algorithm more opportunities to “match” as a voice search result.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The higher a page ranks for a specific keyword, the more likely Google is to choose that page as the voice search result.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;When&amp;#8217;s the last time you&amp;#8217;ve audited your current marketing strategy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;Doctor Genius provides their clients with an easy to use, personalized practice management dashboard.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;Simple, easy-to-read content helps with voice search SEO. &lt;b&gt;The average Google voice search result is written at ninth grade level. &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/voice-search-seo-study&quot;&gt;Backlinko&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;FAQ components can be found within each service page of our client&amp;#8217;s websites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;FAQ pages are in a format that’s perfect for voice search: a conversational question and a brief answer right underneath it. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/google-launches-qa-structured-data-for-question-answer-pages-308999?utm_source=marketo&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_content=scap&amp;amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTnprd01XUXpNamhtT1RVMSIsInQiOiIyYnJKNlJwQTBlT1hQYnJpbTdRVFdMWDJTVE5CbXVHWXNpTGlJXC9zbGIrTWFFSFwvbFIzVzgycVFraDBabHIzdWNUd0J4R1d3RlZlaXJwaG9JVUVacVdqN1ZQdXhvbXdEcW1qbWZwSDZ2c3pQdUNJeDNmb29aVFFoWEU3dE9UOWp1In0%3D&quot;&gt;Search Engine Land&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;These questions are formatted to read on a high school level to easily communicate with the algorithm. With the use of simple language, patients and Google can easily identify your business as the optimal search result which benefits the overall visibility of the practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;So what does this mean for&lt;i&gt; your &lt;/i&gt;practice?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In some parts of the world, children are forced to live in underserved communities that lack communal areas suitable for children to play. Fortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cornerstonefv.com/new-page&quot;&gt;Cornerstone Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; has partnered up with Kids Around the World to promote Playground Project 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1210&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/playground.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 2&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/playground.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/playground-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/playground-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/playground-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/playground-177x133.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playground Project 2018 is about more than just helping children to have fun. Through community support, Cornerstone Fellowship uses its donations to send high school and college students to various parts of the world to restore community parks and playgrounds. The fellowship explains how giving back has inspired greater change in their local community, which then transcends to other parts of the world. With one commitment in mind, Cornerstone Fellowship will, without a doubt, spread love, positivity and most importantly, bring smiles to children of Panama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kelvin is just one example of the kids we&amp;#8217;ve had the joy of connecting with over the years in Santa Catalina,” they explain on their donation page, adding “When we first met him, he was one of the kids attending VBS&amp;#8230;now he&amp;#8217;s young man who has worked alongside us in our last couple trips to Panama.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornerstone Fellowship is serving the community through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;VBS Surf and Skate Ministry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The team sprucing up the local schools&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Providing children with a variety of games&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Serving those in need in various parts of the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Cornerstone Fellowship also plans to build a playground that will have a positive and lasting impact on the community of Santa Catalina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;&quot;&gt;“We are partnering with Kids Around the World (www.kidsaroundtheworld.com) and some locals in the community to build an amazing playground so that we can seize this opportunity to not only go and love the people of Santa Catalina, but also give a generational gift that will impact their entire community.” –Cornerstone Fellowship&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1211&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_2863.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 3&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1875&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_2863.jpg 2500w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_2863-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_2863-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_2863-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_2863-177x133.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It takes a community to raise a village&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a family-owned agency, Doctor Genius is passionate about investing in community outreach programs that give families the opportunity to prosper in healthy environments. As we help medical professionals increase their reach in the digital landscape, we also see a huge significance in investing in our future generations. Helping to build a community that can provide children the love, hope and guidance they need; which is exactly what we’re all about!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope our contribution of $5,000 will make an impact on Cornerstone Fellowship to complete their mission and provide the children of Panama a safe and enjoyable childhood experience they deserve.

In an online market with multiple products available, there are numerous situations in which professionals invest in an online tool and are unsure of how to truly utilize it. For instance, having a tool that identifies effective keywords is only effective when someone knows how to apply those results to the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Doctor Genius has the knowledge necessary to utilize specific online tools to help get your professional website more traffic. This 5-part blog series summarizes a few of the tools that we employ in our packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;SEO Keywords&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic function of a professional website is to advertise a service or group of services in order to reach consumers. The effective method for keeping people on a website is to provide content covering services or related topics. However, there are thousands of resources online that can appear higher up on a Google search over our clients. Thus, we insert SEO keywords into text that will help the website appear higher up the search list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Call Tracking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many private medical practices, having a working phone number is an important part of the appointment process. No matter how much information is on a website, there is always a need for patients to call the office. However, professionals do not keep track of all phone calls and what source generated them. A call tracking system can measure which ads or web pages are bringing in the greatest amount of traffic. This way, we can shift focus from one aspect to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;The Pew Research Center states that at least 77 percent of U.S. adults own a smartphone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Overloading a Website with Content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is important to have content on a website, simply flooding a website with content or copying more content onto a website will cause issues instead of benefits. Along with that is the fact that content needs to include topics and keywords that can help boost Google search list rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mobile First vs. Mobile Responsive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mobile first website is when we create the mobile version of a website so that it appears on a phone screen without causing other issues. After creating the website for phones and tablets, we will then create the website for the desktop, as well. This way, you can have a website that appears properly on all devices without cutting off page content or causing other issues.&lt;/p&gt;

The journey of the potential patient usually begins with an internet search that factor in online reviews, what insurance guidelines the patient has to follow and geographical location. If a website does not cater to those search parameters, then the website will have trouble attracting a steady flow of new patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the patient’s journey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand the mindset of the potential patient who is in need of dental care. While advertising specific types of services on a website can be beneficial, professionals need a website that can effectively display those services in an easy-to-navigate manner. Patients need to feel that they can trust what the website states to a certain degree. Thus, reviews about the medical practice hold a certain amount of influence over people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Ryan Erskine highlights statistics in a Forbes article, which states that 90 percent of consumers read online reviews before visiting a business. While people may be able to sense when a review is fake or the individual is over exaggerating, there are still many people who trust reviews to a certain degree. Thus, having a website that links to reviews and having professionals recommend patients leave reviews will help to promote their practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reviews are an important part of what people consider when searching for a practice, location also influences where they will go. Many people will merely type in the name of their city and the type of care they need to start the search. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help ensure that a specific practice appears within the different map apps and for the search phrase, “City, Dentist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;The Forbes article adds that 91 percent of adults use search engines online to find information on the web.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Proper website presentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to stand out among the masses on Google search results, professionals need a quality website service that continues maintenance and updates to the website. Doctor Genius does both of these things and more, applying skills and necessary tools to the foundation of the website. At Doctor Genius, we build a website with the potential patient’s focus in mind. We know where to place the correct terms, information and content people want immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team understands that when people are considering calling a medical practice, they are searching for the surface level of information. After finding the basic information, patients may begin to look at the rest of the website to find quality content that breaks down the practice’s services. While each patient is different, there tends to be a similar search routine for medical care. Insurance also plays a significant role in selecting a medical practice. We can help the professional determine how much or little about the subject they want to place on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

This untapped market makes up about 75.4 million people according to the Government Census in 2015. However, the census also states that millennials are much more diverse and use various forms of technology for seeking medical care as opposed to traditional methods. Fortunately, Doctor Genius has an event about how to reach this untapped market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Marketing to millennials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With technological advances, more and more people use cellphones or tablets instead of their computer. At this point, laptops and traditional desktop computers are becoming less of a mainstay in homes. While having a website can help a medical practice reach potential patients, millennials are less likely to search the web and more likely to use social media and apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Doctor Genius is hosting the event: Marketing to Millennials on March 15, 2018 at the Residence Inn by Marriott Santa Clarita Valencia from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. with dinner included. This event can also add up to 3 CE credits for attendees. For more information on the event or to register, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/events/marketing-millennials-03152018/&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals may not realize that 85 percent of millennials use a smartphone, which grants them access to web browsers, social media platforms, apps and more. Due to this, it is less likely that people will pull out their laptop or computer every night. Medical professionals need a mobile-first website that can adjust to the screen size of the device. Part of marketing to millennials involves reaching them on their highly-mobile digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 2&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1113&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;5 in 6 millennials connect to businesses via social media.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Reaching patients through other digital platforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media may have started out as a platform for friends to communicate with each other, but has now become a platform for much more. Businesses of all kinds can use social media to reach out to loyal customers and new consumers with active posts. Medical professionals can link to their website through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the PEW Research Center found in August of 2017 that two-thirds of Americans reported that they got at least some of their news from social media. People are seeking information on these platforms instead of searching for the specific medical service online. Our event will take the time to go over tips and techniques for utilizing these platforms to reach new patients. We can also offer methods for patient retention and maintaining these patients for years to come. If you are interested in this event, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/events/marketing-millennials-03152018/&quot;&gt;register today&lt;/a&gt; or call us for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

While a post may not be necessary every day, it is important to have regular posts that display the website is active. Google sees this as a “freshness signal” that boosts your ranking and will be less inclined to put a website that only posted once in the last 6 months anywhere near the top of search results. Thus, custom blog posts can help to keep a website active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Content marketing for a medical practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By uploading content on a regular basis, the website can remain active and help a website be more present in Google searches. In fact, even social media can help to promote a practice. HubSpot finds that in 2017, around 74 percent of people say they use Facebook for professional purposes. While other forms of social media can also be effective, medical professionals can use a social media account to promote new content on websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we can help create blogs to post on our clients’ websites each month. The number of blogs will vary per package but can all aim to achieve the same goal of promoting the client’s practice. We also understand how to craft blogs that utilize keywords to help promote a specific service or type of treatment from the client. The content that Doctor Genius posts on a website can also help bring in new patients and increase the conversion rate; the rate at which people click through a link to the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;HubSpot states that in 2017, at least 53 percent of marketers stated that blog content creation was their top inbound marketing priority.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The necessary maintenance and support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand that while many dental practices provide the same general services, there are specialized services that only certain professionals offer. Thus, we can help customize the content to match those specific services. Our Support Team is available to help make changes to website content in order to help it function at its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our content can also help bring in new patients to your practice. In fact, in 2016, Econsultancy found that only about 22 percent of businesses were satisfied with their conversion rates. With constant support and regular content uploads each month, we can help you rank higher in Google search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in enhancing your website, give us a call today. We can help you and your practice start the New Year off right with an effective and efficient website.&lt;/p&gt;

In the beginning, things seem to work out and the website attracts more patients. Over time, less and less new patients contact the practice. Looking online, the professional finds that the website is broken on certain pages and does not appear in the first few pages of most Google searches. This professional needs a company like Doctor Genius to provide constant maintenance for any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Constant maintenance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for a website to run smoothly, there needs to be constant maintenance from a skilled professional. At Doctor Genius, we have a team of professionals who can provide the necessary website maintenance to help our clients receive the benefits of a website for their practice. If there is ever an issue with the website, we have professionals available to help fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also continue to help monitor other mechanisms within the website and ensure that they are running properly. One of the main functions of a website is to bring in new patients. While a website can offer patients a system for scheduling an appointment online, many offer an office phone number for the patient to contact the practice. However, a call tracking system can help keep track of what is working and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;According to Invoca, 65 percent of people prefer to contact a business by phone as opposed to the 24 percent who prefer to fill out a form online.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 2&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1089&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Call tracking system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professionals may not realize that the importance of a call tracking system. A call tracking system can help to analyze all marketing efforts of a website and determine which are the most effective. At Doctor Genius, we can help determine what is bringing in new patients and what is not. We can then change the website for these needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Invoca states that 73 percent of marketers prefer to feature phone numbers in marketing emails if they can effectively track the data. While texting is a more common form of communication in other situations, people want to be able to speak with a professional representative about the available services. At Doctor Genius, we can track if the emails with a phone number are effective or if the social media page is the source of new patients calling in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our call tracking system, other services and website maintenance, we can help you reach new patients in an effective manner while also help with patient retention. If you are interested in building a website for your practice or updating your current one, do not hesitate to give us a call today.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, the team at Doctor Genius can underscore your skills and expertise with our website framework effectively. We can also help to provide maintenance and ensure that your website is functioning properly. The first step is to ensure we customize the website to your desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Finding an effective structure for your content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to have quality information on a page that breaks down a professional’s practice. However, it is also important to have a website that functions properly in attracting new patients. The call to action, CTA, is one example of a tool that helps draw patients into the service from the website. The other benefit of a CTA is that it can be more than a simple “Call Now” message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can customize or personalize a CTA to promote specific products and services. At Doctor Genius, we can help do just that by customizing the CTA for patients, depending on the practice. Out of 93,000 CTAs, Hubspot.com states that targeted CTAs convert 42 percent more visitors than untargeted CTAs. Along with the call to action, we can also help to customize the website to your requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1080&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 2&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build your website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we can customize the color, logo and overall style of a website to your needs. By working with our Support Team, you will be able to go over all functions of your website and any potential designs. It is important to note that while you can customize your website, there will be specific tools and structures that we implement for the overall functionality of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;&quot;&gt;Hubspot.com found that placing an anchor text CTA on a page, increased the view-to-lead conversion rate of website visitors by 121 percent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can identify the key location for a CTA and the other page content. An example of a smart CTA is to highlight a specific medical service or special on the page with similar content, such as a CTA about investing in dental implants on a dental implants page. Another example is highlighting a CTA with a deal for teeth whitening on a teeth whitening page. We can also provide slider images and text on the homepage based on your services and desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since setting up an effective website can take some time, do not hesitate to give us a call for more information or to schedule a consultation. Start off the New Year right with a fully functional and customized website today.&lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to reading most forms of<a class="moretag" href="/home-part-vi-location-location-location/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/home-part-vi-location-location-location/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/home-part-vi-location-location-location/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2017 17:00:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People read left to right on a page in almost all circumstances. When it comes to reading most forms of text, few people will read it differently. Thus, when people view a webpage, they will read the same way. However, people do not read everything on a webpage and may skim the page, making it crucial to highlight specific details in easy to read places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What people want to see&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is becoming less of a social norm than what it used to be. The Pew Research Center finds that in 2015, around 27 percent of U.S. adults did not read a single book within 12 months. The problem is that this lack of reading does not stop at just books, but it continues to any form of reading, including online content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people may skim or click “Accept” without reading the Terms and Conditions of an IOS update, but people may also skim content on a web page. If someone needs information on dental implants, they may only have one question out of hundreds of possible questions. If the individual finds the answer, then he or she is less likely to stay on the specific page and may “bounce,” or move, to another website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By placing crucial content in specific spots on a page, we can help ensure that the individual sees the most important information about a practice. This is where the “Z-Pattern” can be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;&quot;&gt;Brandon Jones states in a blog on envato tuts+, that “The Z-Layout is a great way to start just about any web design project because it addresses the core requirements for any effective site: branding, hierarchy, structure, and call to action.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1069&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1069&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 2&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;412&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2-300x206.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2-177x122.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Source: Understanding the Z Layout; http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-the-z-layout-in-web-design&amp;#8211;webdesign-28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Z-Pattern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Z-Pattern is a design that follows the projected route of the eyes when an individual reads, left to right and top to bottom. The pattern starts with the top left of the page to the top right, diagonally down the middle to the bottom left and then to the bottom right. Imagine that the reader makes an imaginary line from the top left to the top right and this line is where a practice needs to include the main components the viewer needs to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagonal line will include the body of content, including bits of information that relate to the main focus. The bottom line will contain the call to action at some point. It is important to note that the Z-Pattern is only useful for pages with less content. For the pages with a large amount of content, we will choose to follow the F-Layout instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we know when and how to use these layouts properly and help sell the specifics of the page for you. We can help you customize the website for your practice and maximize the level of access for the information that shows off your practice. Call us for more information today.&lt;/p&gt;

Most people prefer pictures that describe the story or advertise the product. If a webpage was going to describe the process for dental implants, people will wonder what a dental implant looks like and how it looks in the mouth. Instead of the individual going to Google for answers and leaving the website, give the individual what he or she wants by including informative images on the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Giving your practice a face&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images on a website can accomplish a variety of tasks with even only a few pictures, including images of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Your location&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The head medical professional&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The team members at the location&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Various tools and rooms of the facility&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The map view of practice from Google Maps&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Your logo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images can put a face to the practice that act as trust signals for potential patients. For instance, an individual is less likely to consider a practice with no image of the medical professional in charge and only text that states the professional’s background. It is also important to take a few quality photos of the team members, outside of the facility and rooms within the facility as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These images can help people get a clear picture of the location they are considering for professional medical care. It is also beneficial to break up the text on other pages of the website with images showing various services or actual patients rather than stock photography. By utilizing quality content with images that promote a happier response from potential patients, you can increase the chance of people spending more time on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;Buzzsumo states that in 2015, Facebook posts with images saw more than double the amount of engagement than those posts without images.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Keeping a strong presence on social media&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image 2&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1060&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the above statistic, text is still important and people still read. However, people surfing social media will spend less time reading a long post about dental hygiene or another medical service if there is no image. In many cases, people will scroll right by the post without even noticing. Thus, it is important to include images or video in social media posts to promote your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Buzzsumo also adds that in 2015, articles with an image once every 75 to 100 words, received double the number of social shares than articles with fewer images. While this statistic may change in the following years, it is important to note that images only work in the proper location. Without knowledge on where to place them, people may misuse images or oversaturate a webpage with too many images and not enough content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we understand the crucial locations to place images and how to use them to help promote a website online. We can provide the expertise to highlight your skills as a medical professional and overall practice to web users. The first step is to call us and begin the process today.&lt;/p&gt;

With that in mind, we are hosting a webinar on the newest RankBrain update that can affect your practice website and the number of people who see your website in Google search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is RankBrain?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question probably running through your mind is “What is RankBrain?” Google has created a machine-learning artificial intelligence system that helps Google process its search results, known as RankBrain. While this may not seem like something that could heavily impact your website, there are three main ranking factors that Google relies on, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Links&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Content&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;RankBrain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RankBrain is a machine-learning AI, which means that it can acquire knowledge by building on what it already knows and from what one teaches to it. In other words, RankBrain will ignore websites with low-quality content in search results. This will only make it more difficult for people to find your website in search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image 2&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to have a team who understand how this update works and how to implement quality content that helps potential patients find your website and remain on the website pages longer than other websites. The bounce rate is the rate at which people view a webpage and leave it, “bounce,” for another page. In fact, lower bounce rate as a byproduct of high-quality content.

Due to this fact, it is important for medical professionals to build a strong online presence that reaches potential patients. This is where Doctor Genius comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Connecting patients to doctors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, our main goal is to help you expand your practice through online marketing. We can help healthcare practitioners expand their patient base, boost brand awareness and help doctors build trustworthy connections with patients that serve as a ladder to sustainable practice growth. To help attract and retain new patients at your practice, we utilize the effectiveness of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Digital media&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Social marketing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Online reviews&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quality referrals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can monitor all of this through an online portal that displays the factors of your growth and website activity. Our team has the skills and expertise to utilize these tools and help your practice display in Google searches. We understand how to utilize website text and marketing to help your practice be near the top of Google results lists when a patient searches for services within your medical field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;&quot;&gt;To help summarize our services and overall goal, here is a video about Doctor Genius.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cgXsqix8tE?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An effective website across multiple devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we understand that people use different devices of varying sizes from smart-phone screens to desktop computers. The PEW Research Center finds that as of January 2017, nearly 77 percent of Americans own a smartphone and that around 9 in 10 Americans are regularly online. With this in mind, most people will probably use smartphones, tablets or laptops to conduct any form of web searches. Thus, you need a website that will properly display on any device and provide equal ease of use across all platforms for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one likes visiting a website on a smartphone or tablet, only to have the website cut off pages or become difficult to find the navigation bar. At Doctor Genius, we create mobile-first websites that will render properly on any device. This way, when a patient uses your website, they will be able to easily view and navigate your services no matter the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of working with Doctor Genius is that we have an in-house support team available every day to help answer any questions, fix any issues and address any concerns you may have. For more information on our services, watch the video and give us a call.&lt;/p&gt;

People may<a class="moretag" href="/home-part-iv-effective-calls-action/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/home-part-iv-effective-calls-action/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/home-part-iv-effective-calls-action/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:00:23 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An effective call-to-action can be the final push that a potential patient needs to seek a specific service. People may recall TV commercials from childhood ending with, “Buy now,” or “get one while supplies last.” While these examples can be effective for certain products, medical practices may need a slightly different approach. People will usually spend more time contemplating where to go for any form of medical care than buying a new movie or clothes at a store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Up front and center&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a medical practice, the call-to-action is a crucial step that needs to utilize both specific text and a button/window to capture the attention of a potential patient. For instance, if there is an option to “Schedule an appointment today,” then there needs to be a button or window that the individual can interact with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interaction is key since it promotes direct contact with the practice through the online portal or by calling the practice over the phone. The call-to-action can also help users navigate to other pages on the website from the home page. For instance, having the call-to-action button, “Click Here to Read More” can increase the chance of the individual navigating from the home page to that page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calls-to-action help create a home page that entices users to seek the practice’s professional service. It is important to have a clear call-to-action on the website home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Be clear and concise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 2&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;Curatti.com states that 70 percent of small business websites do not have clear calls-to-action on their homepage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call-to-action on a home page needs to be clear in order to improve conversion rate. The conversion rate for a website is the rate of website users who become patients. In order to increase the conversion rate, it is important to have a clear call-to-action that highlights the specific type of care at the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting the call-to-action in the first person to address the user will also help. Another step in creating an effective call-to-action is to include easy-to-access contact information. By structuring a home page to display the call-to-action in an easy-to-read place, the user will be more likely to interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we can customize the home page to not only highlight specific services but also present calls to action in such a way that the patient will be more likely to interact with the website. While it is not difficult to write out the phrase “Call Now” and place it on a button, we know the proper way to create and place the call-to-action.&lt;/p&gt;

When you visit a website without a menu or navigation bar, it pushes you to search other websites as it becomes too difficult to find the information you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Easy use for a longer visit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A navigation bar is the main tool that will help guide people on a website. Without one set in place, the user will have more difficulty navigating the website. If there is too much difficulty in navigating a website, the potential patient will search elsewhere. If a patient is searching for information on regular dental checkups at a specific practice and is interested in what the website states, then he or she may also search another page for more information on scheduling an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the website is difficult to navigate, then the patient will be more likely to “bounce” to another website. Bounce is a term for when an individual leaves after only viewing a single page on a website and seeks to view other pages from a different website. The longer a potential patient spends on a website, the better chance that the patient will schedule an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;Doctor Genius offers clients a mobile first website that renders the webpage to accurately display on any screen size. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason that navigation bars are crucial for the success of a website is that they offer fast and efficient use of a website. In this day and age, people do not enjoy having to wait for anything. People want it fast and want it now. Thus, a navigation bar allows for people to immediately search for the specific service they need. Although, there is a new platform that has taken over many homes and the process for how people use the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mobile first technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image 2&quot; width=&quot;5120&quot; height=&quot;3837&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-989&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog.jpg 5120w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-1024x767.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-177x133.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 5120px) 100vw, 5120px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pew Research Center finds that as of 2016, at least 95 percent of Americans own a cellphone of some kind. PEW also finds that around 77 percent of adults in America use smartphones. With smartphones, people are now able to search the internet and complete a variety of other tasks with ease. Thus, having a mobile first website is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile first means that the website renders the size to match the screen of the user’s device. A medical professional needs a mobile first website so that there are no issues finding a search bar on a phone or tablet. More and more people conduct searches on these devices while watching TV or relaxing at home, instead of using a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we offer clients the option to customize the navigation bar to the top/scrolling, top/static, or left/static of the webpage. This menu option will change with any device to accurately match the screen size. By investing in Doctor Genius, we can build your website to not only be mobile first but also be easier to navigate. With the proper navigation, people are less likely to leave your website.&lt;/p&gt;

There are several reasons why proper presentation for a website<a class="moretag" href="/home-part-ii-presentation-key/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/home-part-ii-presentation-key/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/home-part-ii-presentation-key/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2017 16:00:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Professional presentation for a website is crucial for medical professionals. There are several reasons why proper presentation for a website can bring in new patients or push them away, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fully-functional website&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Mobile-first website&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Relevant content and background information&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Links to reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are only a few of the necessary tools a website will need. When a patient is searching for a new doctor, dentist or other medical practice, a strong website can provide an accurate depiction of the professional services available. Without a stable and effective website, potential patients will look elsewhere for the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fully-functional website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a survey on Mashable.com, they measure the general health care trends for patients online. One statistic displays that 69 percent of parents will seek medical answers on WebMD instead of contacting a real doctor, while 40 percent will search Wikipedia, 22 percent on Facebook and 20 percent on YouTube. With the internet being such a popular platform for people seeking medical advice, your website can be a source of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is great to have information on a website, it is important to have a website that actually works properly. At Doctor Genius, we will run continual maintenance on the website and post content on a regular basis to ensure that the website is actively reaching new patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Statistic Image 1&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-975&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mobile-first website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology in smartphones continues to evolve and allow people to accomplish more with such a small device. In fact, Demi &amp;amp; Cooper Advertising and DC Interactive Group find that 19 percent of smartphone users have at least one health app on their phone. While an app may not be as useful for a medical practice, having a mobile-friendly website can. Since most people use their phone or tablet devices to use Facebook, Instagram, search the internet and send emails, there is a high chance that they will look up medical professionals on those devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mobile-first website will change the architecture of the web pages to match the screen of the device. This way, when people search for your website on their phone, it will adapt and display everything properly instead of cutting off pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Relevant content and background information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we work with the client to cover all of their relevant background information and content to advertise their services. By including this information, potential patients receive a trust signal in knowing that the medical professional has relevant information on a fully-functional website. This information also promotes starting a conversation about the patient’s health needs with the professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Links to reviews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By including patient reviews on the website, people will not have to search elsewhere and can clearly see what people enjoyed about your medical services. We can also link to these websites for patients to see more reviews and vice versa. People will find the reviews online and visit the website. Thus, this system draws in more patients from across the web to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

You want the user experience to be positive and beneficial enough that the individual does not leave the website. While it is fairly easy to build a homepage, it is much more difficult to determine what one needs to put on that homepage and where. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Presentation and representation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many medical professionals may assume that they do not need a website and rely on word of mouth or reviews on platforms such as Yelp!, a website can reach many more potential patients. Not only expanding a medical professional’s reach, a website can also help to create a platform for patient-professional conversation. However, the content on a home page can make or break a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a home page is too difficult to navigate or does not explain what the professional does in an effective way, then the potential patient is most likely to search elsewhere. Here are a few key factors Doctor Genius implements into a client’s homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Navigation bar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important tool for any website, a navigation bar is crucial for helping people find what they need. While there will be ads and content on the homepage that may direct the user, the user may be interested in a service that is not the medical professional’s main one. We can customize tabs for various services and information for an easier user experience. This way, the user will not leave a website due to confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 2&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-968&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Calls to action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A home page needs at least one call to action but will benefit from several. Since most medical practices cover multiple procedures, highlighting specific services in these procedures can be extremely beneficial for the professional. Website users will then be able to see specific services immediately upon using the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;Curatti.com states that 70 percent of small business websites do not have clear calls-to-action on their homepage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having images to support the written content will help give a clear indication of the services. Along with that, the images can help create a style for the website and capture the emotion that patients feel after using the service. Images also promote presentation of the homepage. At Doctor Genius, we place images in crucial locations to help tie the text with a visual cue to reach the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Location, location, location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius can also help ensure that all necessary information is above the fold. Meaning that when a client first views the homepage, all necessary information is there. We also focus on the placement of information based on users’ habit of reading left to right. With this in mind, we utilize the “Z-pattern,” to help highlight the most crucial areas of content.&lt;/p&gt;

The<a class="moretag" href="/brick-brick-part-iv-maintaining-steady-stream-content/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/brick-brick-part-iv-maintaining-steady-stream-content/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/brick-brick-part-iv-maintaining-steady-stream-content/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2017 16:00:27 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Part three of the “Brick by Brick” series, focused on the need for quality content and what that entails. The crucial aspect of content marketing is the rate of published content for a website. The content rate will help keep a website active and up on the front lines of search results. While the quality of content is important, the rate of content is just as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Keep it running&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active content that holds some form of relevance for the website can help to bring in more traffic. In 2015, Ascend2 found that 72 percent of marketers agreed that relevant content creation was the most effective content strategy. While quality is still crucial to promoting a website, there needs to be a steady flow of content. Posting a blog once every few months will not be effective. We can post multiple blogs a month on your website and promote them through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software engineer, author, and founder of WanderlustWorker.com wrote in a Forbes article that “in the beginning, Google doesn&amp;#8217;t trust you,” adding, “If Google doesn&amp;#8217;t trust you, you&amp;#8217;re not going to rank on those lucrative first-page SERPs*. You&amp;#8217;ll be lost in the fray amidst millions of others who&amp;#8217;re trying to claw their way to the top.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that people cannot take shortcuts in posting content on a website. “Thin content with errors, or duplicate content and spun content can really hurt you,” Adams explains. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can provide clients with effective content that reaches potential patients on the website and on other social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Branching out to other platforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Branching Out Into SOcial Media&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-959&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;HubSpot found in 2016 that for the previous two years, content consumption on Facebook had increased by 57 percent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If online content is one thing, it is versatile. Online content can branch out to multiple platforms of social media that all lead back to the client’s website. By utilizing social media platforms to share content on a website, Doctor Genius can help clients gain increased website traffic. In 2016, HubSpot also found that 76 percent of people use their Facebook feed to find interesting content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Genius will not only post engaging content onto your website, but we will also create posts for social media accounts that lead patients to your website. This way, potential patients will find a post about your practice in their social media feed that can lead them back to your website. We can help your website continue a positive relationship with Google and reach more patients in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

Medical professionals need accurate and engaging information that reaches out to potential patients and captivates them. However, there are several other purposes for online content outside of being a source of information that portrays a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Including keywords&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keywords are a particular word or phrase that help a website rank on search engine results. When someone is in need of a specific medical service, he or she will type in a specific phrase or set of words. We can measure which sets of phrases are more common than others and use them within the content of your website. While keywords can help a website rank, they are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Keeping a website active&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HubSpot states that about 53 percent of marketers say that blog content creation is their top inbound marketing priority in 2017. By creating, customizing and posting blogs on a monthly basis, we help to keep your website active and appearing on Google’s radar. This helps Google to see that the lights are still on at home and place your website on the search results. By including these steps and other tools, we can help increase the rank of a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Targeting specific audiences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create content that targets specific demographics and age groups of potential patients. After all, HubSpot found that in 2016, about 43 percent of people admitted to only skimming blog posts. It is no surprise that people are not always going to just stumble onto a blog post from a medical professional’s website. Thus, Doctor Genius will create custom content that targets specific audiences to bring in more website views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With titles and phrases that advertise a specific service, we can help identify the most popular demographic to reach. However, there are other ways to help a blog or website appear in search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Effective Online Content&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-945&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;In 2015, eMarketer found that 8 out of 10 marketers worldwide use location targeting in mobile advertising.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Geo-Targeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Verge, states that in May of 2017, Google has more than 2 billion monthly active devices on Android. Monthly, Google has over 1 billion people using Chrome, Maps and Search. By creating mobile first websites, we can help our clients reach patients over multiple digital platforms. More importantly, we can target people by area. Geo targeting allows us to customize and build content for people in a specific area. With geo targeting, we help our clients reach areas surrounding the zip code they practice in, as opposed to only reaching residents directly nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using Doctor Genius, you can feel assured in knowing that we are attempting to reach potential patients through multiple electronic devices in surrounding areas for a better chance at a higher ranking and more patients.

Those numbers only continue to rise as social media becomes a dominating presence in the digital landscape. Companies and private practices alike are all using social media to reach social media users and convert them into patients/customers. Known as conversion, Doctor Genius has the right tools to help accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Engaging social media users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While people believe that using a social media account is fairly easy, effectively using one to convert users into patients is exceedingly difficult. Hubspot finds that in 2017, approximately 74 percent of people use Facebook for professional purposes. Statista states that Facebook had 1.13 billion daily active users in 2016. Social media is a thriving platform for medical professionals to reach potential patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hootsuite.com defines conversion rate as “a positive action that is taken on a website by a visitor from social media,” adding that “The action demonstrates that the visitor is “converting” into a customer.” Even with a website, ranking high on search result is not an easy task. With how busy many medical professionals can get, maintaining a social media account can become exceedingly difficult. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can work to provide regular posts to engage followers on different social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engaging users on a regular basis is necessary for a social media account to reach potential patients and hold relevance on users’ feeds. In other words, if a social media page does not continue to make new posts and share content on a regular basis, people are less likely to even notice it in their feed. However, posting on a regular basis is only the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Converting social media users into patients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;&quot;&gt;Social Media Examiner found that in 2015, around 90 percent of all marketers using social media, generated more exposure for their business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Doctor Genius provides the service to continue posting carefully-crafted posts on a regular basis for the client’s social media accounts.

Without a strong foundation, the website will never accomplish<a class="moretag" href="/brick-brick-part-website-built-strong-start/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/brick-brick-part-website-built-strong-start/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/brick-brick-part-website-built-strong-start/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2017 16:00:29 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A strong foundation is everything when it comes to a website. Without a strong foundation, the website will never accomplish what it sets out to do and much like the foundation of a house built on sand, it will fail under pressure. While DIY services make creating and maintaining a website easy, there is always someone working on the website’s code through the back door. However, it can be difficult to find a service specializing in website maintenance and design, while also specializing in content for various medical professions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Start off with a strong foot forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we strive to create an effective website with quality content pertaining to the client’s profession. From the first meeting, our team works with the client to create a website that meets the client’s needs and Google’s search engine specifications. One of the biggest factors to help a website rank high up near the top of search results is using keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keywords are terms or phrases that pertain to the client’s area of expertise and ranks highly due to popularity on search engines. A search engine will target keywords, to sum up the page and help direct people to the page. For instance, a dentist who uses the keyword “Teeth Whitening,” will be able to attract people to the website who are searching for that term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, keywords are only one of the first steps to building an effective website. We can help our clients start off with a strong foot forward with several crucial factors, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Constant website maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Technology to review ranking traffic&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Mobile-First website&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Regular website backups&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Call tracking system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;We are here to help every step of the way&lt;/h3&gt;

During the Brick By Brick series, we will explore several factors that help make an effective website, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Social media marketing&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;An effective and educational content marketing system&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Consistent stream of content to keep a website active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Websites continue to try and keep up, only to find that there are multiple rules, regulations, and laws that seem to change constantly. Due to this, professionals in a variety of fields strive to keep up with the changes and help their website rank. With all of the challenges these changes present, Doctor Genius can help clients keep up with these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What you need to know&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is beneficial for professionals to reach potential patients, clients or customers outside of the professionals’ local area, it is crucial to tap into the local market. While creating and maintaining a website is a crucial step, it is only the beginning. In order to rank, Google will scan a website for multiple factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Sitemap&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Keywords on the website that match popular search results&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The page title and meta description&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Inbound links&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Quantity and quality of words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By gaining notoriety and business with locals, professionals can create a solid source of profit with locals who will return in the future. Google is trying to provide a realistic experience for local users with information based on the exact time and location of the user. Thus, ranking in local search results is an important factor leading to one’s success. In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers who conducted local searches visited a store within five miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Joy Hawkins writes in an article on SearchEngineLand.com, “Google actively filters out listings from the local results that are similar to other listings that rank already,” adding that “Google picks the most relevant listing of the bunch and filters the rest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This algorithm can actually help some businesses rank better on local search results, especially when there are other professionals offering similar services in the same profession. While Google will not go into the specifics of their updates, Doctor Genius can follow these updates and adjust accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Doctor Genius has the knowledge and expertise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-909&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

The only issue is that you do not have the time to focus on click-through rate. Fortunately, Doctor Genius will not only help maintain a presence, but can also utilize tools to enhance the click-through and conversion rate. People may not realize that click-through rate is for ads where conversion rate measures website traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;More than just an ad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ad for one’s practice is not nearly as simple as just stating the name and a service. Professional practices need to use the right words, structure and presentation to increase the chance of click-through rates. While these factors are important to helping potential patients click on an ad or landing page to go to the official website, there is a learning curve to effectively increasing the click through rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify, click-through rate is the measure of the number of people who view a piece of content with the “Click here to read more” button and follow through on the action. Hootsuite.com explains, “If 100 people saw your ad in Google and one person clicked on the ad, you would have a click-through-rate of 1.0 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the methods for increasing a click-through rate differ for various fields of business, there may not be a single method for increasing the rate. Fortunately, Doctor Genius has the knowledge and skills to improve a website’s click-through rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Website Structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-12-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-862&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-12-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-12-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-12-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;In 2016, Ascend2 found that 54 percent of marketers say increasing the engagement rate is their top email marketing priority.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to click-through rate, conversion rate is the measure of website visitors who follow through on an action within the page of the website. The difference being that the individual is already on the website. However, the website needs to have an easy-to-navigate structure so people want to stay on the website and can find the information they need. Smartphones are becoming the popular choice for people searching through websites on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Google found that 65 percent of smartphone users look for the most relevant information through a Google Search on their smartphone without much emphasis on the company providing the information. Smartphones are a universal tool that can complete both an Internet search and Facebook post at the same time. Thus, having a website structure that works on both desktop computers and phones will greatly benefit the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Doctor Genius, we develop a mobile-first website that displays properly on smartphones and other devices. We also focus on achieving high conversion and click-through rates for you.&lt;/p&gt;

In many cases, parents will have to push back dental checkups for their children or even cancel with no new appointment in sight. Another issue is reaching a greater base of potential patients through the proper channels. Fortunately, Doctor Genius offers the services to help with reaching potential patients.

&lt;h3&gt;Consistent Content Rate&lt;/h3&gt;
Keeping a consistent rate of high-quality content on a website will help to keep the website active. Thus, Google will see that the website has new content on a regular basis and place it higher on a list of search results. When someone searches for “dentists near me,” Google will place active websites first over websites that do not have new content on a regular basis.

&lt;h3&gt;Social Media Management&lt;/h3&gt;
Along with consistently uploading new content to a website, clients also need to continue posting on social media platforms. Regular posts will help to appear on follower’s feeds, which in turn will allow other friends of those followers to see the posts. The posts can also lead back to the website and increase more new patients.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;We can provide you with quality content and professional support to keep your website running effectively and smoothly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Call Tracking System&lt;/h3&gt;
A call tracking system allows for professionals to monitor how many calls they receive from new patients or current patients. At Doctor Genius, we use this system to measure how many new patients a client has each month and determine the best method for bringing in more new patients.

&lt;h3&gt;Mobile First Website&lt;/h3&gt;
A mobile first website will respond to whatever device an individual is using and reorganize the site to match that screen. This way, if the individual is viewing the website on a smartphone, then it will appear to fit that screen correctly. This is crucial as smartphones are a common and essential technology of today.

&lt;h3&gt;Service Pages with Keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
We also provide clients with service pages that pertain to their area of medicine and services they offer. We create the custom content for these pages and ensure there is a proper amount of keywords to help the page rank higher in Google search results. During the process of creating a website for you, our Support Team will go over keywords that rank and pertain to your services.

Google’s Rules are Changing in Oh So Many Ways]]></title><description><![CDATA[With Google’s new change, any HTTP website will display the message “Not Secure” on its pages. Similar to the Beatles,<a class="moretag" href="/http-help-googles-rules-changing-oh-many-ways/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/http-help-googles-rules-changing-oh-many-ways/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/http-help-googles-rules-changing-oh-many-ways/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2017 16:00:35 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>With Google’s new change, any HTTP website will display the message “Not Secure” on its pages. Similar to the Beatles, many people feel their independence vanish in the haze with this latest update. A requirement that will force people to use HTTPS on Google Chrome leads to a complicated transition for many websites and companies.

&lt;h3&gt;Heed the warnings&lt;/h3&gt;

It is important to heed the warning Google sends out now since October 2017 is the month in which they will enact this change. While some people may wonder how big of an impact this will be, “I mean, how many people use the Google Chrome browser anyways?” As of November 2016, Google announced that there were over 2 billion active Chrome Browsers.

With so many people relying on the Chrome browser for a variety of reasons from searching for an answer to settle a debate to searching for a dentist in the local area, seeing “Not Secure” anywhere on the page will definitely push people away from clicking on the website. Any HTTP website will not be able to remove this warning unless the website upgrades to HTTPS.

Another reason professionals need to pay attention to this change is that Google will rank an HTTP or “Not Secure” website lower on the list than a HTTPS website. With ranking being on the line, professionals who have a website or are considering a website need to ensure their website is ready for the change. One way to ensure that everything works with the transition and does not decrease ranking is by seeking a professional service that has the tools and skill to keep up with the times.

&lt;h3&gt;Don’t get left in the dust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-700&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt; The “S” in HTTPS is part of SSL, Secure Sockets Layer, and is the standard security technology to establish an encrypted link between a web server and browser, ensuring that all data between them remains private.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June of 2017, Facebook reached 2 billion monthly users. Medical professionals who do not utilize social media are missing out on the chance to reach a greater number of patients in the digital landscape. However, professional social media accounts require constant management.

&lt;h3&gt;The key to effective social media marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

While adults will seek out information about dentistry or other medical practice, it is no surprise that younger audiences will not. It is important to know how to use social media to reach your target audience. Having multiple accounts on social media platforms is crucial for medical professionals to reach people of various demographics and backgrounds.

After all, HubSpot found that in 2017, 74 percent of people say they use Facebook for professional reasons. Keeping up multiple social media accounts from Facebook to Yelp, can become difficult with a busy schedule.

However, the key to effective social media marketing is efficient social media management. For instance, a post about proper brushing techniques can contain hyperlinks that take the individual back to your website with more information.
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col m7&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Facebook, by far, sends a greater volume of readers to both short-form and long-form news. Overall, about eight-in ten user complete interactions with a news article via a social networking site come from Facebook (82% long-form and 84% short-form), while a much smaller portion come from Twitter (16% long-form and 14% short-form). –Pew Research Center, 2016&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col m5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-673&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2.jpg 378w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2-300x294.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2-177x174.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
You can have your target demographic reading more content on your website through the proper social media posts. At Doctor Genius, we know how to help reach out to the target audience that will respond best to your content.

&lt;h3&gt;Keeping up constant posts&lt;/h3&gt;

Social media accounts that do not keep up consistent posts will find fewer followers and views on their profiles. If you do not have someone to keep an active account, then it is less likely to drive traffic. Thus, having a company that specializes in social media management and marketing to help keep the updates going is a great benefit for your practice.

At Doctor Genius, we will help clients by updating multiple accounts with active content to help them to reach more potential patients. With our services, we can help direct patients from social media to the active content on your website on top of multiple service pages. We will help customize the website to your requests while also ensuring effective content.

By seeking the services at Doctor Genius, you can focus on your practice and we can take care of your digital presence online. If you are interested in more information, give us a call.

In 2015, Google<a class="moretag" href="/core-successful-online-marketing-mobile-first-websites/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/core-successful-online-marketing-mobile-first-websites/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/core-successful-online-marketing-mobile-first-websites/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2017 16:00:15 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>From desktop to mobile online marketing, medical professionals find great benefits in having a mobile first website. In 2015, Google found that 51 percent of smartphone users discovered a new company or product when conducting a search on a smartphone. Similar to how commercials on TV are still relevant to promoting products, having an easily accessible website that works on mobile devices is crucial for any successful practice.

&lt;h3&gt;Easy access&lt;/h3&gt;

With the invention of smartphones, society began to rely on these devices for more than a few apps and phone calls. Google also found that in 2015, more Google searches took place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan. A professional practice will greatly benefit from a website that is mobile-first.

Many people may browse potential dentists or doctors in their local area by searching on their smartphone while watching TV at home. Regardless, mobile searches are a crucial aspect of how potential patients determine which practice they will choose. A website that takes too long to load or is too complex to use will only motivate the patient to search other practices. Also, Google will not rank a website that takes too long to load. Thus, it is crucial to have a mobile first website.

A mobile first website means that when people search the website on their smartphone or tablet devices with a smaller screen than a computer, the website is responsive or will load proportionately to the screen. At Doctor Genius, our clients can rest easy knowing that we pride ourselves on building mobile first websites to help bring in potential patients.

&lt;h3&gt;All the necessary information on the go&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;&quot;&gt;Google also found that in 2015, more Google searches took place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While cell phones of the past were a technological revolution for providing call services from virtually anywhere without a cord, smartphones are famous for being able to access thousands of search results anytime anywhere. With today’s smartphone, people can have equal or more computing power to a desktop computer.

Professionals need to ensure that their website has all of the necessary information readily available and easy to access on any device. If a potential patient looks at a client’s website on a smartphone and finds that the page does not work or load properly, they will probably dismiss it.

Thus, Doctor Genius will set up a mobile first website that works on multiple devices and stands out in the digital market. With our tools and techniques, you can enhance your website and increase the efficiency with which you bring in new patients. Call us for more information today.

When it comes to investing in a medical service or purchasing a product, potential customers may actually avoid websites with too much information or text. Information overload can lead to people seeking services elsewhere.

&lt;h3&gt;Avoiding too much information&lt;/h3&gt;

In a study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS, titled “On Making the Right Choice: The Deliberation-Without-Attention Effect,” participants chose between four cars. With one car being better than the rest, the first group of participants was given four facts about each car while a second group was given 12 facts about each car.

The results show that the group that had less information chose the better car 60 percent of the time. The group that was given 12 facts about the cars only chose the best care 20 percent of the time. This study is only one example of how too much information can dissuade a potential buyer and the same applies to potential patients for a medical practice.

With the advancements of the digital market, a variety of businesses continues to rush to create a website representing their brand, services, products and company information. Medical practices also greatly benefit from having websites. However, overloading a website with too much content will actually have a negative instead of a positive effect on the website’s conversion rate.

&lt;h3&gt;Quality content for the audience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-668&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus, professional practice websites need to balance quality with comprehension.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While a website does need the right amount of content to describe services and rank online, clogging up pages with too much content or too many complex terms can make it difficult for potential patients to navigate. It is important to remember that the people looking at a medical practice’s website will be people outside of the medical field. Thus, professional practice websites need to balance quality with comprehension.

In an article online, Google states that ranking based on numbers and factors that include the freshness, diversity, rich textual and originality of content. Another factor to consider is that keywords can rank higher in search results without requiring a large amount of dense content. This is why it is crucial to have a company who understands the ins and outs of online marketing and content creation.

At Doctor Genius, we can help you reach more potential patients with custom content. We strategically create content that matches your needs while also helping the website rank on search results to bring in more patients. Making a website more complex and dense will lower the conversion for potential patients.

Fortunately, there are specific steps that one can take to reach a higher level of healthy online activity and success. The team at Doctor Genius has the knowledge and expertise to utilize the correct keywords for a client’s website and help increase their ranking online. However, effective keywords are more than simply choosing any words related to a field of medicine.
&lt;h3&gt;What are keywords?&lt;/h3&gt;
Keywords are words or phrases that match up with terms people type in search engines online. For instance, Google explains that, “Selecting high quality, relevant keywords for your advertising campaign can help you reach the customers you want, when you want.” With so many possible terms and phrases to use, it is crucial and beneficial to invest in the services of someone who understands how to pick effective keywords.

Keywords will help a professional’s website show up higher in list results of searches. This way, our clients can have their websites rank higher on search results and increase website traffic for the chance of gaining new patients. In 2015, Advanced Web Ranking found that there is a 31.5 percent click through rate for the number one position on mobile Google search results.

&lt;h3&gt;How do keywords work?&lt;/h3&gt;
By choosing keywords that people commonly type in search engines, your website will have a stronger chance of appearing at the top section of the search results. For instance, a common keyword can be “Emergency Dentist,” or “Whitening.” By making these keywords, people who type that word or phrase into a search engine most likely find your website before others.
&lt;div style=&quot;width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers went to a store within five miles of their home after completing a local search.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, it is not as simple as flooding a website with keywords and waiting by the phone.

&lt;h3&gt;How do you select effective keywords?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-660&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

At Doctor Genius, members of our professional team help you select the keywords that are effective in ranking and pertain to your professional services. With so many methods for selecting keywords, it can be easy to select an ineffective or faulty service. Thus, Doctor Genius will help you select the effective keywords to enhance your website.

We can also help clients use keywords that market to the local area. In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers went to a store within five miles of their home after completing a local search. It is crucial to select keywords that will rank in that area.
&lt;h3&gt;Should I only focus on keywords?&lt;/h3&gt;
While keywords are an important tool for any professional’s website, they are not the only tool a professional needs. A website needs constant updates to show Google that it is active while also utilizing reviews that are a huge factor in ranking. Doctor Genius can help keep a website active and monitor social media accounts of the practice to help increase that rate of potential patients.

To answer the question, “Are Keywords Effective?” The answer is yes. However, effective keywords are only part of a much larger set of tools necessary to communicate with Google effectively. If you are interested in our services or more information about keywords, give us a call today.

In fact, a lack of understanding on the business side of any practice can be a private practice’s downfall. Fortunately, along with other professional companies, Doctor Genius provides the necessary advice for effectively starting your own practice in today’s industry.

&lt;h3&gt;Learn the most effective tips of the trade&lt;/h3&gt;

The “Business of Dentistry” event takes place from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 4, 2017, at Park Plaza in Irvine, California. Affiliates and speakers of this event include professionals from companies such as:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Burkhart&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Mostofi Law Group&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;HR for Health&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Bank of America Corp.®&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;JLL® (Jones, Lang, LaSalle Incorporated)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Nickerson Consulting&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Practice CFO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The event is an effective opportunity for dental professionals to learn the crucial information one needs for success in the industry. This event can help professionals looking to acquire an existing practice or start their own. Many dental professionals have all the necessary degree, knowledge and expertise on dentistry to provide high-quality dental work, but do not know how to begin their own practice.

With this team of professionals, attendees will be able to earn 7 CE credits for the one-day event. Acquiring a practice or starting a new is much more than just buying the property and starting a company Facebook page.

&lt;h3&gt;Reach more potential patients&lt;/h3&gt;

A professional can have a website of the most eloquent prose or custom-made images from a graphic designer and still not rank very high in search results. The key is learning to understand and speak the languages of Google and the digital market.  Fortunately, Doctor Genius is fluent in several digital languages to help our clients stand out.

&lt;h3&gt;An active blog says more than 1,000 words&lt;/h3&gt;

While clients may want a certain look or feel for a website, the website needs to match up with Google’s requirements in order to rank on search engines. We can ensure that the website is both user-friendly and that it speaks Google’s language. For instance, a website needs active content to even rank in the first place.

An active blog is one such way to keep a website active. HubSpot found in 2016 that 1 in 10 blog posts are compounding, which means that organic search can increase their traffic over time. Even old posts can have a positive effect on website traffic as HubSpot found in 2014 that 75 percent of HubSpot’s total blog views and 90 percent of all blog leads come from old blog posts.

By posting blogs on a regular basis, even just once a month, medical professionals can bring in more traffic and send a message to Google that they are still active. Google will be more inclined to put an active website with ranking content than a website that does not. Doctor Genius can find the healthy balance to provide clients with a quality user-friendly website that will rank well online.

&lt;h3&gt;Regular posts bring in more patients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, HubSpot stated that content consumption for the past two years on Facebook had increased by 57 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Any patient who sees a Facebook page that only posts once every few months will be less-inclined to follow that page. HubSpot found in 2017 that 74 percent of people use Facebook for professional reasons, such as to advertise a practice. Thus, it is important for professional medical practices to keep up regular posts. However, the wrong type of content may not have much of an impact or even have a negative impact.

At Doctor Genius, with a team of personnel onsite, we post content that will help generate more likes and bring in new followers. By keeping up active Facebook and blog posts, we can help our clients build up a larger patient base and actually retain patients for years to come. We understand how Google ranks web content and will take the necessary steps to enhance our clients’ online presence. Give us a call and take the first step toward enhancing your website today.

With multiple options for almost every medical practice in a single city, the competition can get fierce. While patients can utilize free website builders for a quick one-page site, they do not have the skills or internet know-how to continue maintenance on a website.

&lt;h3&gt;The tools are only as useful as the skills of the holder&lt;/h3&gt;

As any medical professional will know, having the tools and knowing how to properly use them are two entirely different things. A dentist can have the latest technology, but lack the skills for the proper use. It is the same way with creating an online platform to display one’s practice. At Doctor Genius, our clients are skilled medical professionals who put in the time for the credentials, but do not necessarily have the prowess to keep an effective online presence.

An example of a new tool that has pros and cons is the Website Builder available on Google My Business. In an article on searchengineland.com, Senior SEO Manager and Columnist Tony Edward, reviews the new builder. While this builder can help professionals create a one-page website, there are several cons to the process, including only offering a “One-page site, no option to create additional pages,” Edward writes.

Edward also finds that there is no ability to add custom page titles, no analytics integration and no ability to add call-to-action buttons. With other cons in the article, it is apparent that this new website builder will not benefit anyone searching for a website that can continue to rank, bring in new patients and continue to expand over time. Doctor Genius can offer the website platform while also providing the services to help truly enhance a practice.

&lt;h3&gt;We can make the process easy&lt;/h3&gt;

During the summer, a dental checkup is the last thing on the minds of children and teens. With better thoughts of feeling the sand between one’s toes at the beach, going on vacation, relaxing at home, playing video games and spending time with friends outside of school, children do not even consider the idea of visiting the dentist unless they absolutely have to. However, before school starts up, late summer is the perfect time for parents to bring their child to the dentist. Dentists and other medical professionals need to be ready.
&lt;h3&gt;Catch the wave and bring in more patients&lt;/h3&gt;
With any type of medical practice, summer can easily become the busiest season of the year, especially in the end of July and throughout August, when school is fast approaching. Parents are desperate to get their children in for an appointment before school starts back up and schedules become more complex with a large variety of extracurricular activities.

In fact, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, finds that students lose more than 51 million hours of school each year to oral diseases and other dental-related illnesses. Dentists have an excellent opportunity to provide the necessary checkup and professional cleaning a child needs to remain healthy.

By displaying a professional practice in such a way to showcase how parents can prevent their child from missing school and keep their child healthy, a dental practice will be able to begin bringing in more clients. At Doctor Genius, we can:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Create a call-tracking system to help schedule new patients&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Give the client a website that helps the practice stand out in the digital market&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Help the client showcase the best qualities of their practice to potential patients&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Help clients maintain a constant flow of patients throughout the year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Even if the practice presents the benefits of summer appointments on a website, it is in the style and details of the presentation that will truly help a practice stand out.
&lt;h3&gt;Don’t miss out on this opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-619&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
At Doctor Genius, we have the tools and technology to help you showcase your practice and build a strong digital presence online. With summer in full swing and school quickly approaching, do not miss out on the opportunity to bring in more patients and reach greater levels of success.

While bringing in new patients is great for a medical practice, retaining patients is another crucial step. Doctor Genius can also utilize specific strategies to help with patient retention and generate a healthy annual flow of patients. We know how to target specific patients, such as parents searching for a dentist or other medical practice to help give their kid that checkup before school starts.

You put together the poster board<a class="moretag" href="/presenting-practice-facts-notecards/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/presenting-practice-facts-notecards/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/presenting-practice-facts-notecards/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2017 16:00:05 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>Most likely, everyone has given a presentation at one time or another in life. You put together the poster board or create a PowerPoint, gather facts and statistics, and present it to people. When it comes to presenting information in a classroom or on a website, there is one main factor that can make or break a presentation: how one organizes and displays the content.

&lt;h3&gt;An ever-changing market&lt;/h3&gt;

The 2017 State of Inbound report finds that the top challenge for 63 percent of marketers is generating traffic and leads. While anyone can make a post or write a blog, the correct quality content will make all the difference. In order to help a professional practice receive an increase of views on a website, the patient needs to have easy-to-access content on the site and ensure that it is the right information people need to find.

In a 2015 study, Google finds that 65 percent of smartphone users search for the relevant information, no matter who is providing the information. With at-home products allowing people to utilize voice search instead of typing searches online, patients will use certain keywords or terms that may limit search results.

With so many alternative methods for seeking a medical practice and a constantly changing digital market, medical professionals need to know how to navigate the digital market.  Medical professionals have the skills and knowledge to treat patients for a variety of conditions, but may not have the knowledge on how to present and market that skill.

Fortunately, Doctor Genius knows how to present and organize content in an effective manner for better results.

&lt;h3&gt;Presenting material effectively&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-618&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2-300x200.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2017 State of Inbound report finds that the top challenge for 63 percent of marketers is generating traffic and leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A website with too much information will make it difficult for people to navigate a medical professional’s website. Patients are less likely to visit a website on any electronic device if it does not have:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Easy-to-access contact information&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Helpful FAQ-like pages that summarize services in an easy-to-read manner&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Clickable phone number link for smartphone users&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Mobile responsive design&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Reviews from other patients of the practice&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Summary about the medical professionals that is not too complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Doctor Genius has the ability to supply all of these website tools and more. We have the development and support teams on-site to help perfect a website. We also help you customize the website to your needs. We will help you present your service in an effective format that gives people an accurate representation of who you are as a medical professional.

In order for a client to order the product, contact customer service, inter-office communication, schedule an appointment, you need a phone number. For a professional medical practice, having a call tracking number helps with much more than just scheduling appointments. People are more likely to click call a tracking number online than email the professional.

&lt;h3&gt;More than just a means of tracking the number of calls&lt;/h3&gt;

In a 2014 study by Google, the results show that 78 percent of consumers think the local address in an ad is important and 77 percent think displaying a phone number is important. Possible patients want to feel they are contacting a service that will not cheat them out of quality. If patients find it difficult to contact a practice, then they will be more inclined to seek services elsewhere.

We can help professionals utilize what are known as “trust signals” such as a phone number, address, online reviews and more to help show patients that the practice is real and trustworthy. However, a medical professional may not enjoy the idea of having his or her personal phone as a main point of contact for patients. A call tracking number will be available for future patients and will help to track calls.

&lt;div style=&quot;width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same Google study, 70 percent of participants prefer a call button on a website when using their smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It is important to listen to what consumers enjoy or find easiest to use in communication. Patients may seek a different practice than their current one if it is too difficult to contact. At Doctor Genius, we can help utilize call tracking and determine the most effective means of communication.


&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22b-The-Study-Call-Tracking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-599&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22b-The-Study-Call-Tracking.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22b-The-Study-Call-Tracking-300x200.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using call tracking to help you&lt;/h3&gt;
At Doctor Genius, we use call tracking to:

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Track the number of calls a patient is getting&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Help the professional differentiate between old and new clients before picking up the phone&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Create effective tools such as a calling button on the website for easy-smartphone use access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We understand how to utilize computer, tablet and smartphone platforms to provide the proper view of a client’s website. In the same Google study, 70 percent of participants prefer a call button on a website when using their smartphone. At Doctor Genius, we can customize the call button and your website with the patient in mind. We will ensure the website is easy to navigate and has all of the mechanics to ensure the patient can directly contact the practice to schedule an appointment if necessary.

We also offer our services in a variety of packages to provide potential clients with multiple options and services. We will spend the time to take all information into account before we determine which plan can most effectively bring in new patients.  If you are interested in Doctor Genius or have questions about our services, do not hesitate to call us at 877-477-2311.

An independent consumer study from TalkTo found in 2013 that the average person spends about 13 hours per year or about 43 days on hold in a lifetime. Fortunately, the Support and Client Services team at Doctor Genius can offer the help that you need when you need it.

&lt;h3&gt;We’re here to help you&lt;/h3&gt;

We not only supply support to clients, but we have a team of marketing specialists, support team members and sales representatives on standby to address any issues or answer any questions that you might have. We do not rely on an automated system to solve a client’s issue and will ensure that we find the solution for your needs.

We throw away the annoying and challenging barriers that customers face when they have to speak with a machine or automated system to answer questions. In fact, American Express conducted a survey in 2011 which found that 67 percent of customers hung up out of frustration that they had to speak with a machine and not a real person.

While our system will direct a caller to a specific department, we will be there to speak with the client as soon as we are able and solve their problem. We provide constant communication in order for you to get the most out of your website and our services. We also strive to offer quality content on a regular basis.

&lt;h3&gt;A high caliber of custom content&lt;/h3&gt;

Social media is becoming an effective tool for professionals of any field to reach clients.  However, professionals need the social media know-how to navigate the system and gain more patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A strong presence in social media&lt;/h3&gt;
From Pinterest to Twitter, dental professionals are able to interact with patients and share information about their services online. Social media can give professionals an opportunity to offer their services, promotions and information to potential patients with the click of a button. Twitter is one such platform that allows for quick bits of information.

In 2016, the PEW Research Center found in a group of 1,520 adults, 79 percent used Facebook as their main social media platform. Meanwhile, CNN writes on money.cnn.com that Facebook is climbing toward 2 billion active users as of the end of 2016. With the variety of content that people post on any social media platform, there are a variety of tools that people use online. One such tool is known as the hashtag that helps people find the post more easily than before.

In another study of the PEW Research Center, they explain that “The hashtag symbol (#) is used before keywords to categorize tweets and helps facilitate searches within Twitter.” By using the hashtag symbol, professionals can help patients find a specific post about dental care. Examples can include #DentalCheckups or #ProfessionalTeethCleaning. The PEW Research Center also finds that “Clicking on a hashtag will show all the tweets in a category.”

Twitter is beneficial for a quick and small post that appeals to patients who do not need or want a lot of information. However, attaching any word to a hashtag symbol does not guarantee that more people will read the post.
&lt;h3&gt;Let Doctor Genius enhance your practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-548&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag-300x200.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

At Doctor Genius, we understand the mechanics of social media, utilizing Facebook and Twitter to promote a client’s practice. While Facebook is extremely popular, people will frequent other platforms online for various reasons. The PEW Research Center also found that in 2011, around 57 percent of all tweets from The Daily Caller and 21 percent of all tweets from the Washington Post used the hashtag symbol.

While the hashtag symbol can be effective, we will not flood every single tweet, Facebook post or comment with hashtags. We have a team of professionals who can help create, customize and continually monitor online content to ensure that our clients get quality service. Social media has more tools and methods for promoting one’s practice to potential patients. We strive to help our clients’ Facebook pages appear on other people’s feeds, while also reaching out on Twitter.

In fact, a dental professional may feel something akin to déjà vu in telling patients to keep up regular dental hygiene. Patients may not realize that there are multiple reasons to work with the dental treatment and to continue visiting a dentist. Fortunately, we have the tools to help spread the word about your practice and draw in new patients by displaying a comforting atmosphere online.
&lt;h3&gt;A guiding source of oral health care&lt;/h3&gt;
In all forms of medicine and treatment, people who participate in their treatment find better results. Healthaffairs.org reviews data from a Health Policy Brief, stating that “A growing body of evidence demonstrates that patients who are more actively involved in their health care experience better health outcomes and incur lower costs.”

More importantly, patients are beginning to move to these locations that successfully help people achieve higher levels of health. Healthaffairs.org also states that “many public and private health care organizations are employing strategies to better engage patients, such as educating them about their conditions and involving them more fully in making decisions about their care.”

To compete, dental professionals need to have a website that engages the patient and acts as a source of information for the patient’s needs. Professionals can engage patients in a positive way before even seeing them in the office with a strong online presence. At Doctor Genius, we can help to do this by displaying important information in a positive manner.
&lt;h3&gt;Create content that matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-541&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/patient-involvement-img2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/patient-involvement-img2.png 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/patient-involvement-img2-300x200.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;We not only offer information about the client’s dental practice on the website, but we also offer tips for patients’ overall health. We create content that will help motivate patients to keep up healthy oral hygiene at home and visit the dentist on a regular basis. By creating an informative and helpful website, patients will feel better about remaining with our client instead of going elsewhere.

However, we stress that at-home care will only accomplish so much in terms of keeping teeth healthy. On the website, we point out that the patient needs to seek your services for professional care and treatment. A dental professional can identify any signs of potential infection or disease and treat it before it spreads.

With the correct content, patients will refer to your website for information and schedule an appointment. We can help engage the patient to help them become more active in their treatment. It all begins with an effective website, which is what we can offer dental professionals. We have the tools and resources to keep a website and social media page active.

You went to medical school and got the degrees. You opened a practice. Now, you are using every possible method to build your practice. However, no matter what methods you try, there is an apparent lack of new patients. No matter what you attempt, there seem to be fewer and fewer patients walking through the door of your practice. Fortunately, we have the solution through our Online Marketing Services at Doctor Genius.

&lt;h3&gt;More than just online marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

After asking 4,500 marketing and sales professionals, Hubspot.com found that 65 percent of these professionals stated that generating traffic and leads for their company was the most difficult step. It is easy for a company to throw terms such as “local search” at possible clients and not provide effective services. In many cases, dentists will look for a company to help enhance or build a website, by comparing the price. In reality, dentists need to compare performance rather than price.

Following the mortgage market failing in 2008, small mortgage companies throughout the United States began going out of business and closing their doors. Thus, the industry for local online marketing began really taking off. With so many companies offering marketing services, professionals struggle to find a credible service.

At Doctor Genius, we pride ourselves on performance and building a relationship with the clients to promote their practice. Unlike other companies that may run online marketing techniques in the beginning, but not have the client’s interest at heart, Doctor Genius strives to bring a client’s desires to fruition. Doctor Genius will work with the client from day one to create a mobile-friendly platform for the clients’ private practice.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-529&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Building a reliable connection with clients&lt;/h3&gt;

We strive to set up a positive relationship with clients by implementing the client’s requests into a mobile-friendly website. At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Create informative content using Google’s current algorithm changes&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Develop pages from the needs and requests of clients&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Help keep the website active with monthly blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Help funnel traffic from search engines to the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With the available payment plans, the price will not need to be as large of a concern as with other services. Whatever the price may be, Doctor Genius will provide the performance necessary to help a private practice reach success. If we can help clients receive between 25 to 50 new patient inquiries every single month, then the price should not prevent owners from promoting their private practices.

Our results help clients build trust with us in understanding that we provide more than placing specific terms on a digital platform. We build the website and work with the client to create a website that represents their practices. You can feel confident in knowing that we will help accurately represent your practice’s vision and mission statement online.

This event is a weekend full of the latest advancements in dentistry, courses on effective dental practice techniques, over 550 exhibitors from all areas of the dental market and a plethora of speakers; among which, Doctor Genius will be present.

&lt;h3&gt;Offering the marketing solutions a dental practice needs&lt;/h3&gt;

Dental practices can greatly benefit from having a strong online presence and active website. Doctor Genius not only offers professionals a chance for a stronger online presence, but we also keep the website active and use key marketing techniques to help professionals extend their reach online. Doctor Genius will be at booth #234 at the CDA event to go over the marketing solutions and available technologies. Here is a list summarizing our services.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19b-TheStudy-CDA-Event-11231.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-518&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19b-TheStudy-CDA-Event-11231.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19b-TheStudy-CDA-Event-11231-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19b-TheStudy-CDA-Event-11231-177x118.jpg 177w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Website&lt;/h3&gt;
We create custom content and personalize websites for each client. At Doctor Genius, the client can feel safe knowing that the website contains all of his or her services in one place.

&lt;h3&gt;Branding&lt;/h3&gt;
We also deliver effective brand strategies to help give practices a major edge in competitive markets. We will use the proper branding to highlight the client’s services and areas of expertise.

&lt;h3&gt;Search Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
We can narrow down the list of keywords to the words that most frequently appear in people’s searches online. With a list of keywords for each client, we can work to yield higher numbers of new patient inquiries into one’s practice.

&lt;h3&gt;Review Management&lt;/h3&gt;
We can highlight positive and easily-readable reviews of a client’s practice on the website. After reading the reviews, patients will be more likely to consider a practice for dental care.

&lt;h3&gt;Hyper-Local Targeting&lt;/h3&gt;
We will increase the focus of a client’s website to the local area and enhance the client’s reach to possible patients there. By targeting the local area, we can help the client rank higher online in the local area.

&lt;h3&gt;Social Media&lt;/h3&gt;
We will not only help monitor and create regular posts for the client’s social media pages, but we will also ensure that the social media pages remain active and engage followers.

&lt;h3&gt;Start with a strong foot forward&lt;/h3&gt;
We help clients build trustworthy relationships with their patients by providing strong online content. We also provide ranking reports and help maximize the client’s website for better results. Working with Doctor Genius, clients can start their practice by putting a strong foot forward with a professional, mobile-first website.

Professionals are growing more accustomed to patients avoiding treatment until it is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, a new trend may put patients in more danger and more risk of causing permanent damage than they realize with new DIY, Do It Yourself, orthodontic straightening options.

&lt;h3&gt;DIY needs more than just instructions&lt;/h3&gt;

In a report from ABC Action News in Philadelphia, PA, available on 6abc.com, the article states “Orthodontists say this alarming trend appears to be on the rise,” adding that, “Most likely it&amp;#8217;s due to the cost and time it takes for professional straightening.” DIY trends are popular for multiple reasons, including:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Achieving a sense of accomplishment&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Saving money&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Personalizing a useful product to use in the house&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Creating a fun activity to spend time with others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
However, a DIY tooth straightening is not similar to an at-home cure for a sore throat or skin moisturizer. There is a reason that orthodontists are required to have two to three extra years of studying in dental school to specialize in orthodontics and patients need to realize that. The DIY teeth-straightening products range from self-placing rubber bands for closing gaps to even using 3D printer technology for creating orthodontic trays. The American Association of Orthodontics, AAO, explains in further detail on their website, mylifemysmile.org that they are “urging consumers to beware of Internet videos and websites which encourage people to try and straighten their own teeth.”

The DIY teeth-straightening products range from self-placing rubber bands for closing gaps to even using 3D printer technology for creating orthodontic trays. Orthodontic dentists have the tools, knowledge and skills necessary to safely perform straightening procedures. Self-straightening options will only cause more issues and risk further damage to the individual’s teeth.

&lt;h3&gt;Help patients understand the risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be easy for patients to choose a DIY solution instead of a professional procedure after comparing the cost. Patients need to understand why they need to seek professional treatment as opposed to these cheap and dangerous DIY solutions. One effective method of doing this is to create a website that conveys this message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;The American Association of Orthodontics, AAO, explains in further detail on their website, mylifemysmile.org that they are “urging consumers to beware of Internet videos and websites which encourage people to try and straighten their own teeth.”&lt;/h5&gt;

At Doctor Genius, we can help create and maintain an active website that presents the necessary information of a professional’s practice in a readable and informative manner. The AAO continues to highlight that DIY treatment options can lead to:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Permanent tooth loss&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Lifelong dental problems&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Spending more money to repair the excess damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Patients need to understand from a professional’s website and visits to the professional&amp;#8217;s office that DIY solutions are not an effective substitute for professional care. Doctor Genius can also highlight and display the professional’s specialties in such a way as to help inform possible patients about these services. At Doctor Genius, we also help build and maintain social media pages to actively engage followers and patients online.

By actively engaging patients and displaying information in an effective manner, we can help professionals bring patients in for the safe and necessary care they need. Patients will understand why DIY orthodontic and dental treatments are not the most effective or beneficial option.

Whether you call them customers, patients or clients, they all have one main factor in common: they are at your business for quality service. Understanding the needs of one’s consumers can help to enhance the success of one’s private practice. There is now a national holiday for just such a purpose.
&lt;h3&gt;National Get to Know Your Customers Day&lt;/h3&gt;
National Get to Know Your Customers Day occurs the third Thursday of every quarter, writes nationaldaycalendar.com. The website adds that this holiday is to “Make it a point to get to know a little more about your customers and make each of them feel like they are your most important customer of the day.” While that may not always be possible, understanding the needs of the patient and listening to the patient’s requests before replying can benefit the experience.

Access Development gathers statistics of customer loyalty from 2016 and finds that “27 percent of small business owners estimate that 11-20 percent of first-time customers don’t return to their business.” While this applies to a store instead of a professional practice, it stills brings a strong point that people will be more likely to avoid making a return visit if the experience is negative.While people may not enjoy dental checkups in the same way they enjoy a movie, a positive or negative experience at a dentist can lead to the patient deciding to search elsewhere for oral health care. Fortunately, professionals can take a few simple steps to help ensure patients feel more comfortable and valued at the practice.

&lt;h3&gt;What are patients searching for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&amp;#8220;A 2016 study by hitwise of Connexity, finds that 68 percent of online searches on a mobile device concerned health.&amp;#8221;&lt;/h5&gt;
Simple steps can include brightening up the waiting room at a practice and ensuring the furniture is comfortable for people to sit in. Utilizing a website to display information for services that people continually look for in a dental practice can help the business. A website that is mobile-first, meaning that it displays well on both computer and phone devices, will also allow people to research a practice from anywhere. A 2016 study by hitwise of Connexity, finds that 68 percent of online searches on a mobile device concerned health.

Buying customer loyalty is not the key to a successful practice, providing a comfortable and effective experience is the key to success. One method to help build customer loyalty is to ensure that the content on the website matches what the practice offers. For instance, if a dental practice website writes about professional in-office teeth whitening procedures but does not offer the procedure, the patient is going to feel cheated and not return. Consistency is crucial to building trust.

Doctor Genius can help clients develop an effective website for their private practice and bring in more patients with specialized content. For more information on Doctor Genius, call us at 877-477-2311. This April, make your patients’ experiences at your practice the best they can be.

With the digital market growing and becoming a prominent factor for all types of businesses, it is crucial for a business to maximize their online presence. This statistic applies to private dental practices as well as various forms of shopping, with more people reading reviews online, researching practice websites, comparing procedure rates and locations before scheduling an appointment.
&lt;h3&gt;Oh, the platforms your practice will end up on&lt;/h3&gt;
When possible patients search for a practice online, the location is one of the key factors in making a decision. In fact, a common search term is “professional dentist near me.” Thus, many possible patients will end up on Google Maps, searching for a practice near their location that will accept their insurance.

In an article written by Raj Nijjer and posted on geomarketing.com, Nijjer lists four ways to drive in-store traffic with Google Maps. The four steps are:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Be there when people search for you on Google&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Happy customers make great promoters&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Pictures show what’s exceptional&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Give people an insider view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Although these steps seem basic, they are fundamental in helping to promote a private practice. Google Maps has the ability to display more than simply the location of a company, so companies need to utilize all possible tools. Include the basics on a Google Maps profile with hours, practice title and any promotion deals available. By giving patients a location and images of an actual property, it validates the practice by making it a real website for the patient.

&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-422&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-480x320.jpg 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You control how potential patients see your practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In 2013, GE Capital Retail Bank’s Second Annual Shopper Study found that 81 percent of shoppers research online before visiting the actual store.&lt;/h5&gt;
While a practice cannot control the thoughts or reactions of patients online and in the office, a practice can control the image that they present online. As Nijjer stated, “Happy customers make great promoters.” Reviews are a crucial part of the decision-making process. While the patient can write whatever they feel like writing, a positive review will go a long way to helping bring new patients into the practice.

It is also crucial to respond to a negative review with a professional answer. People may search for a negative review to figure out if the review is real or false. The review needs to have a name and cannot be anonymous. It can also beneficial for the practice to respond to the client’s review.

Along with providing patient feedback online, a practice can also provide professional photos of the practice. Similar to how a restaurant produces photos of signature dishes and the dining area, a private dental practice will benefit from posting professional photos of the dental chairs, machinery, waiting room and more.

Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help to provide the digital platform for a private practice and provide quality control for the practice’s website. We will create a new website for the practice and help the practice maintain an active presence online. If you are looking to rank higher on Google searches and develop a stronger online presence, then do not hesitate to seek professional services with Doctor Genius.

Unfortunately, a dental visit is most likely not on that list for many people. A dental practice needs to create a positive experience for patients. Fortunately, there are a variety of methods to do just that.
&lt;h3&gt;Build a positive experience for patients&lt;/h3&gt;
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, finds that only 62 percent of adults between the ages of 18 to 64 visited the dentist in 2014. The CDC also finds that 83 percent of children ages 2 to 17 visited the dentist at least once the same year. It is apparent that adults do not view dental care with the same level of importance for themselves as they do for their children. While adults may have a variety of reasons for a lack of dental checkups from financial difficulties to busy schedules, adults need regular dental care as much as children do.

However, many adults may avoid necessary checkups due to the negative stigma surrounding dentistry. People associate a dental visit as painful, even though technology has advanced to the point where dentistry is comfortable. Patients may not always remember that a dentist can help keep a smile beautiful and healthy. By creating a positive environment for the patient, a practice can help patients feel more comfortable and welcome during the appointment. A practice can also educate the patients on the available methods and technology, helping patients understand that appointments can virtually be pain-free.

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;63 percent of the children indicated that they preferred a decorated dental clinic over a plain clinic.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

To do this, professionals need to begin by presenting a comforting office from the waiting room to the dental chair. Having magazines for adults and activity books for kids is one example of how to at least begin to lighten up a room. A practice needs to be responsive to the patient’s need from scheduling the appointment to dealing with insurance coverage and payment after the appointment. A patient wants a great smile, but may not always want to go through the process for the smile if it is a negative experience.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-413&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients-480x320.jpg 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don’t worry, be happy&lt;/h3&gt;
A study published online in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, conducted by Maha Al-Sarheed, Ph.D., at King Saud University, had 583 children answer a questionnaire. The child participants ranged in age from 9 to 12 years and attended public schools. The study finds that &amp;#8220;63 percent of the children indicated that they preferred a decorated dental clinic over a plain clinic.&amp;#8221; Even a simple change as some decorations on the wall can have a positive effect on younger patients.

While there is not too much that a professional can do to change a dental procedure, a professional can educate their patients on the procedure prior to beginning. For instance, a dental practice can break down the steps of the checkup process for the patient to understand. The professional can also take some time to ask how the individual is doing since the last checkup. For new patients, the professional can introduce the other members of his or her practice and go over what the practice is about.

These are only a few of the possible methods for creating a positive experience at a dental practice. For more information on our services, call us at 877-477-2311.

While it is great when a practice brings in new patients, it is even better when the new patient decides to continue visiting the practice for health needs. Dentists can retain patients and build lasting patient relationships through specific techniques in the digital market. Fortunately, Burkhart Dental is hosting an event with speakers from our team at Doctor Genius and Nickerson Consulting.
&lt;h3&gt;What you need to know&lt;/h3&gt;
Titled, “Are You Retaining New Patients in Your Practice?” This event takes place on Friday, March 17, 2017, at the Marriot Residence Inn 38305 Cook Street, Palm Desert, CA 92211. The event will be from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and will open registration at 8:30 a.m. for attendees. The conference will begin with a continental breakfast before our speakers take the stage to present.

The speakers will answer questions that many medical professionals in the field ask and struggle with on a regular basis. These questions include:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;How do you determine a true active patient base?&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;How do you determine new patients in your practice?&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;How do you look at retention with new patients?&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;How do you determine growth from these key indicators?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Retaining patients can be difficult for a practice of any medical background. While there are a variety of possible techniques for retaining patients and building a consistent amount of patients, not all techniques will be the most effective. This event will help to offer insight into which techniques are more effective in helping with patient retention.

When people hear a company or service mention Search Engine Optimization, SEO, many automatically assume that it is black magic or a hat full of cheap parlor tricks. At Doctor Genius, we have no ulterior motives or cheap tricks hidden up our sleeves. With the proper SEO services backing up a practice, the owner of the practice will experience an increase of influence and reach in the digital landscape.
&lt;h3&gt;The need to know about SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
One main tip that can help clients understand SEO is that there is no shortcut to success. Any SEO service that states a website only needs more keywords to reach a larger audience or to purchase more links is not truly going to help the company’s website. Google recently posted a video on the subject of hiring an SEO company, presented by Developer Programs Tech Lead, Maile Ohye.

Ohye covers several key factors that people need to search for when considering investing in SEO services. The truth is that an SEO company can only do so much with any given website.  “An SEO’s potential is only as high as the quality of your business or website,” Ohye states. Ohye also highlights the fact that an SEO company “Looks to improve the entire searcher experience” from “search results to clicking on your website and potentially converting.” A few services that can help clients achieve this through the use of SEO services include:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A mobile-friendly website&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Good navigation&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Tools to build a great brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It takes time for an SEO company, such as Doctor Genius, to develop or enhance a website and lead to a positive increase in the client’s practice. In fact, as Ohye states, SEO companies need “four months to a year to help your business first implement improvements and then see potential benefits.” Another key component for any company to consider when investing in SEO is that the entire company needs to be committed to the SEO improvements.
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;“An SEO’s potential is only as high as the quality of your business or website,” –Maile Ohye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Put in the effort to watch a company grow&lt;/h3&gt;
With a multitude of methods for improving a company’s online presence through SEO, there are also factors to get the best use out of SEO. Other tips for possible clients who are wary of investing in SEO services that Ohye states include:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Conducting a two-way interview between the SEO company and the client&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Being prepared to answer some questions about one’s business that the SEO company may ask&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Being prepared to receive feedback from an audit on the company and the rates for improving specific areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
At Doctor Genius, we build clients a new website and cover many more aspects than simply placing keywords in the right places. As Ohye states in her video, one of our main goals is to help clients identify their target patient demographic and track how those patients search specific terms online. We use honest methods to help our clients rank online with quality content. For more information on our services or to sign up, call us at 877-477-2311.

Lately, it seems that many businesses rely on discounts and specials to bring in more consumers. Many private practices charge fair and average rates already, making discounts unnecessary. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help a private practice establish trust with patients without relying on constant deals or discounts.
&lt;h3&gt;Consistency online and in the office&lt;/h3&gt;
While there is nothing wrong with a private practice offering discounts or specials on specific procedures, no effective business model can offer them consistently. Offering too many deals on a regular basis can increase costs and lead to financial difficulties in the future. Establishing trust with patients will require more than discounts. The patient needs to feel that this practice will treat his or her health issue efficiently and at a fair cost. BizReport states that 76 percent of consumers view customer service as a test of how much the company values them.

Having a website can be extremely beneficial for a private practice, granting current and future patients access to information about the practice and services provided. Regardless of what the website states, if the patient finds out that the practice does not offer that specific service or does not follow through on the web content, then the patient is more likely to leave the practice. In order for patients to trust a private practice, they need to find consistent information on the website that matches the core values of the practice.

At Doctor Genius, we work with the client to provide quality content for the specific practice and the services it provides. We can help to target what patients look for in a website for a private practice and incorporate it onto the web pages. With consistency, the patient should not feel cheated when arriving at the practice.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-353&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy-480x320.jpg 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep an active online presence through website and social media platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
A private practice can have a website and social media platform, but not rank high in Google search results. This means that no one will be able to find the private practice’s website online unless they type in the precise name of the practice. In other cases, a private practice will have a website but not update any blogs or posts on a social media page. Thus, the client finds a website that does not have an active post from within the current year.

In other cases, a website without reviews from the last year will also push patients away from the website. A lack of updated content can make a patient feel the practice is also outdated or not on top of things, motivating the patient to look elsewhere.

&amp;nbsp;

At Doctor Genius, we can keep up regular blog postings to a website and keep up regular social media posts as well. We understand that it can be difficult for a private practice to balance taking care of patients along with keeping up an effective online presence in the digital landscape. We maintain active content circulating on a website to help keep the website current. For more tips or information on our services, read some of our blogs and call us.

For a private practice, having<a class="moretag" href="/benefits-of-sharing-patient-reviews-online/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/benefits-of-sharing-patient-reviews-online/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/benefits-of-sharing-patient-reviews-online/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2017 18:44:52 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>Reviews are a crucial part of an effective online presence, regardless of the business practice. For a private practice, having positive reviews from patients can greatly increase the likelihood of new patients seeking treatment from said practice. While patients can leave negative reviews, statistics show that online users will search for businesses online before searching elsewhere. It is also important to note is that without reviews, Google will not rank the website.
&lt;h3&gt;The importance of sharing customer reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
In a survey of 2,000 people from Brightlocal.com, 57 percent of patients searched online for a local business at least more than six times a year, 39 percent searched online at least one time per month and 15 percent searched almost every day. When searching online, patients will also take into account what other customers have to say about the business. While a private practice may be concerned over negative reviews, having no reviews in an online presence will be worse.

The same survey finds that in 2014, about 58 percent of consumers searched for restaurants and 38 percent searched online for doctors or dentists in their area. Behind searching for restaurants, medical practices were the next most-searched type of content online. The study also finds that in 2014, around 88 percent of consumers read online reviews to determine the quality of business.
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“around 67 percent of consumers needed to read at least six Benefits of reviews before they feel they can trust the business.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
People use the Internet to find a doctor or dentist in their area that provides that specific level of care that they need. While patients may use referrals from friends or family, patient reviews will also play an important part in deciding on a private practice for treatment. For a private practice, seeking patient reviews to post on the practice’s website is a great way to display positive reviews. If one does not want reviews on the website for their practice, then at least through websites such as Yelp or Google, to give the practice a better presence online.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-340&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy-480x320.jpg 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How people may respond to those reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
With a strong online presence and a website, a private practice will be able to begin drawing in more customers. On average, Brightlocal.com finds that in 2014, around 67 percent of consumers needed to read at least six Benefits of reviews before they feel they can trust the business. Meanwhile, 85 percent needed to read up to 10 reviews before trusting a business. Thus, having online reviews will help to market the practice and draw in more new patients.

For any practice worried about a bad review getting in the way or being a problem for new business, the team at Doctor Genius can help handle that. We can help clients organize their reviews and help them to achieve a better level of recognition online. We can help clients build up their practice online and share the positive reviews they receive. The more positive reviews a private practice displays online, the better chance that more new patients will seek treatment.

From dentistry to chiropractic care, patients need to feel that the treatment they receive at the professional practice is having a positive and long-term effect on their overall condition. At Doctor Genius, we can help review methods for finding effective solutions to treat your patients.
&lt;h3&gt;Finding the best solution is not easy&lt;/h3&gt;
While the main issue for any patient is always about treating pain, patients also need constant care and a practice they can trust. Patients are cautious to trust a medical practice until the practice proves that it is reliable, effective, honest and a strong source of support. The key factor, regardless of the situation, is support. We can help our Doctor Genius clients provide their patients with the care they need.

With various forms to fill out, insurance difficulties, payment options, scheduling conflicts and other factors, the treatment experience can be difficult and complicated for the patient. If the process becomes too complex or confusing, the patient is more likely to seek treatment elsewhere. A good support begins with the first phone call to schedule an appointment. Having a website with all the necessary information and forms the patient needs to fill out will also help ease the process.

For instance, the client can fill out the forms before visiting the office or fill them out in the waiting room. Regardless, the patient will have prior knowledge of the forms and what information will be necessary. The earlier the patient has this information, the more time the patient will have to ask any questions or address any concerns.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-334&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-480x320.jpg 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Provide constant support during and after treatment&lt;/h3&gt;
In order to build a strong relationship with patients and help ensure they return in the future, a practice needs to offer a solid support system during and after treatment. This does not mean that the practice needs to go above and beyond every single day. A solid support system means consistency when needing to answer questions, address concerns, being honest with patients and helping patients understand the treatment.

During an appointment, regardless of the patient being established or new, the medical professional needs to address any concerns of the patient while maintaining a calm atmosphere. When a client comes to a dentist with a toothache, he or she is not only searching for treatment for a toothache, but also for a reliable source of treatment for other dental issues in the future.

A patient may only need a simple checkup but will want to know that this practice will take his or her concerns to mind. Even if the patient does not need a follow-up procedure after the appointment, the patient will want to know what is next. The professional should go over what the patient needs to do to ensure complete recovery. For more methods and information, give us a call at 877-477-2311.

The digital marketing landscape for healthcare is not as simple as posting a single comment on Facebook or sharing a special discount on Twitter. Navigating the digital marketing landscape can be more difficult than some might believe. To have success, a healthcare practice or company needs to be able to evolve with a constantly changing market.
&lt;h3&gt;Times, they are a changing&lt;/h3&gt;
A strong online presence may not completely ensure a strong flow of patients or consumers, but it can increase the probability of reaching more patients through digital marketing. Business Insider cites a report from Custora that finds that “Organic search results accounted for 21 percent of US e-commerce orders,” in the first quarter of 2016, “representing the highest share of all marketing channels.”

While searching online can produce a large variety of results, professionals can rank higher with the proper online presence. However, an online presence may not stand out among other practices in the digital landscape without other methods of creating a strong digital presence. Here are a few helpful hints to better navigate the digital marketing landscape when it comes to healthcare.
&lt;h3&gt;A strong Call-to-Action&lt;/h3&gt;
A private practice needs to have an obvious Call-to-Action or “Why-to-Buy,” on the website. As simple as this might sound, a website that does not have a phone number or efficient forms of communication will lose clients. By having an easy means of communication, a reason that the client should seek the service and patient forms available on the website, the practice will help motivate people to seek their service.
&lt;h3&gt;An easily-readable home page&lt;/h3&gt;
The first page of a website that a potential patient lands on is a crucial factor for the individual remaining on the website or seeking information elsewhere. In many cases, a home page can share a possible deal the practice is currently offering or break down the main service of the company in easy-to-read and understandable forms. The patient needs to be able to understand the content at a quick glance, comprehend it and then decide if it is what he or she needs. The home page needs to direct people to other pages within the website that offer more details on the desired search result.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-320&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-480x320.jpg 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An active social media presence&lt;/h3&gt;
While a social media presence on its own will not drastically increase the number of patients for a practice, it can greatly increase the number of possible patients. In a survey of over 1500 American adults, Pew Research Center finds that “Nearly eight-in-ten online Americans,” around 79 percent, use Facebook over other forms of social media. The same study finds that 24 percent use Twitter, 31 percent use Pinterest, while 32 percent use Instagram. Having a strong social media presence is an incredibly beneficial method for reaching consumers and potential patients. While these are only a few hints, there are plenty more available through our services.

You need to have patients who will return for checkups after the initial visit. A strong Recall System will allow you to establish strong bonds of trust with the patient as a professional practice and ensure Patient Recall. While professionals can attempt to schedule appointments months ahead, the patient may move to another practice or cancel the appointment. Doctor Genius is hosting a webinar event for clients to learn new tips and methods for an improved Patient Recall System.
&lt;h3&gt;The webinar event you don’t want to miss&lt;/h3&gt;
Patient Recall is a crucial step of anyone’s practice and not having an effective system in place can hinder the chance of patients returning. We will cover tips and methods for developing an effective Patient Recall System that will help retain patients and bring more through the doors. The webinar event will take place from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017.

A few simple steps that are essential for effective patient recall include:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Phone call reminders for a regular dental checkup&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Sending postcards with practice contact info to patients with reminder&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Creating an automated recall system&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Adding patients who do not reply to all reminders onto an overdue recall list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
While many professional practices may pre-schedule the phone, email, or postcard reminders about an appointment, patients may still end up canceling. This webinar will cover how to implement effective recall methods into a practice.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-312&quot; src=&quot;https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-480x320.jpg 480w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New recall tactics from a professional consultant&lt;/h3&gt;
Professional consultant, David Orr, owner of Alliance Dental Consulting in Irvine, CA, works to understand and develop dental practices to help them reach greater levels of success. Orr will share tips on his confirmation system with listeners during the webinar.

The confirmation system begins by sending a card in the mail or an email to the patient 28 days before the appointment, requesting confirmation. Since some patients may not respond immediately, consistency is key. Orr will also cover steps with basic recall, overdue recall, responding to missed appointments, unscheduled treatment and more. Orr will go over how to effectively continue keeping up contacting with the patient and increasing patient recall with his system in the webinar.

The webinar will take place from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m., on Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017. While we are always available to answer clients’ questions about the portal outside of this webinar, clients will not be able to gather together with like-minded individuals and receive advice from Blake.  In this webinar, we will be covering:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Reporting&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Running promos&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Submitting Support tickets&lt;/li&gt;

Even with a website and<a class="moretag" href="/the-doctors-guide-for-marketing-to-millennials/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctors-guide-for-marketing-to-millennials/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctors-guide-for-marketing-to-millennials/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2017 20:21:49 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>With the changing market, medical professionals need to know how to draw in more clients. Even with a website and digital presence, medical professionals will experience difficulty in reaching clients of all ages. The fastest growing buying group in the market and the age group professionals seem to have difficulty marketing to more than others, is millennials. Fortunately, Doctor Genius is working with other companies to offer a CE event on the best methods for marketing to millennials.
&lt;h3&gt;Event details&lt;/h3&gt;
The event itself takes place at the Marriott Courtyard in Sherman Oaks, CA, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on February 16, 2016. The registration fee is $25, which includes dinner provided at the event. Others can attend this continuing education (CE) class to earn three credits as well. The focus of the event is to showcase proven marketing methods that attract and return millennial clients including:
&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Active websites packed with fresh, unique and tailored content for specific practices&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Effective branding strategies to give practices an edge in competitive markets&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The importance of active social media profiles&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The most effective retention methods to promote client loyalty&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The use of search marketing to find the keywords that clients select most&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Management of your practice reviews to follow what current clients are saying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
This event will cover many more topics and information on reaching millennial clients. For the event, Doctor Genius is collaborating with Patterson Dental, Bank of America, Nickerson Consulting, Revenue Well and CARR Healthcare Realty. Experienced speakers from these companies, operating in today’s competitive market, will present proven methods of reaching and retaining millennial clients.
&lt;h3&gt;Easier said than done&lt;/h3&gt;
The PEW Research Center finds that 81 percent of millennials are on Facebook and that only 19 percent of millennials “say that most people can be trusted.” This statistic makes it even more crucial for medical professionals to be able to build a strong bond to retain millennial clients. Millennials are a large group of possible clients who mainly connect with each other over social media platforms. A practice that has a successful online presence and active accounts in the digital market can effectively reach millennials.

While most people can construct a website for any known service, keeping the website active, healthy, updated and on the first page of search results is difficult to do. Doctor Genius offers these services and more, using this CE event to go over the most effective methods for maintaining a strong presence among millennial clients. The event will have a plethora of advice from top industry speakers and marketing advice from companies of various backgrounds.

A call tracking number is a unique phone number that you can assign to a specific marketing campaign so that when you receive a phone call, you know which advertisement was effective and invest more resources towards it. Simultaneously, you can tell which campaigns were a dud. Call tracking numbers can also be used when you are testing landing pages or your website to determine which CTAs are generating results. The benefits of using a call tracking solution is that it provides you with the data you need to adjust your marketing strategy to improve your results.

When it comes to SEO, however, you need to be careful in how you use this solution. Particularly when it comes to your business listings. Your name, address, and phone number (NAP) should be the same so that the search engines view your listings as having accurate data. While it could be useful to know if you are getting calls off of your Google local business listing vs. your Bing local listing, the risk of splitting your citation equity may not be worth it.

Instead, use call tracking numbers in ways that is effective and will not negatively harm your SEO. For example, when you are running an AdWords campaign, you can use call tracking numbers, Google extensions, or Google forwarding numbers. If you are running three ads, one with variations of the keyword “teeth cleaning”, another with “dental veneers”, and a third with “dental implants”, you could assign a unique tracking number to each one. That way if someone calls directly from your ad, you can tell which one led to offline conversions. That is the power of a call tracking number. Someone can see your information, pick up the phone, and you will know how they found out about you.

You can also use call tracking phone numbers on landing pages that you are optimizing. Many businesses do so when promoting a specific campaign. In the example of a local dentist, you may want to run a package promotion that offers dental implants at a discounted rate. Not wanting to lose full price business, a landing page can be used to advertise the promotion, attract new customers through organic SEO, and sell implants without disrupting normal business. In this case, a call tracking phone number should be used so that team members can tell how the customers came in contact with the dental office and offer the appropriately discounted rates.

Another benefit to call tracking comes from being able to test out the effectiveness of your website or of specific CTAs. By placing a unique phone number on each CTA, you can determine how far down the page people are reading and which offer or content leads them to act. Once you have finished testing your site, you can change the phone numbers back to the same one that is on your local business listings.

There are additional ways that call tracking numbers can be useful, including on offline advertising campaigns. When it comes to SEO, you should practice caution and be sure that your NAP is consistent across all platforms.

This will grow your practice and gain patient referrals. If you don’t have a lot of time on your hands, don’t worry – most dentists don’t. Fortunately, these social media tips are so easy that you or your office manager can implement them in between patients. As a result, your organic marketing results will improve.

&lt;strong&gt;• Write a value proposition.&lt;/strong&gt; Update your cover image to include your value proposition so that users immediately know what you are about and how you can help them. For example, “healthy smiles for the entire family”. This will increase the likelihood of someone liking or following your Facebook page when they come across it.

&lt;strong&gt;• Create a call-to-action.&lt;/strong&gt; Content marketing is just as important in social media as it is for your website. Write content that inspires people to act, for example, “click here to read more”. While simple, this tip will increase how many clicks you get.

&lt;strong&gt;• Build fans organically.&lt;/strong&gt; It is okay if your Facebook fan page grows steadily over time. This is far better than purchasing a block of fake fans that don’t live near you and could never use your dental services. The power of organic marketing and social media is the ability to expose your practice to those that live within your local area. Focus on the objective, even if it is one fan at a time.

&lt;strong&gt;• Create awesome blog posts.&lt;/strong&gt; You should include blog writing in your content marketing strategy since it gives you the opportunity to share your knowledge, answer questions and provide information for prospective patients. The more often you blog, the higher your chances are for being viewed as a knowledge leader in the community. Through social media, you can posts your blogs and encourage users to read and comment. You can further tie it into your social media by telling people to ask any questions they have that weren’t answered by the blog post. This can increase your user engagement.

&lt;strong&gt;• Keep it interesting.&lt;/strong&gt; Use a variety of post types in order to keep it interesting for your followers. For example, post a video then a picture and a text post. You should also vary the type of content while always staying relevant to your business or community. As an added benefit, you can review your social media analytics to see what type of posts gets the best reaction from users. This will help you to cultivate a more effective organic marketing strategy.

&lt;strong&gt;• Use interesting images.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a variety of free apps that you can download to edit images. If you want to impose a text onto a photo and aren’t sure how, pull out your smartphone. Most of these will let you take a picture, impose text and post directly to Facebook. PicCollage is an easy one to use and completely free.

This represents a significant increase in the number of people conducting a local search, determined to connect with a business close by. This can benefit your dental practice by connecting you with a prospective patient that is in immediate need of your services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Nearby Business Listings product&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To capitalize on this growing trend, Google is offering a new advertising product. The Nearby Business Listings product replaces some of the typical ad copy with features that consumers use on a regular basis. Features like click-to-call and click-for-directions appear in the ad so that when someone is conducting a local search, they can find a nearby business and immediately connect with them. If the search is a mobile search, the convenience of immediately navigating to the business cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a dentist, you should also consider how you can use this knowledge in your current marketing plans. As a company that specializes in optimizing for local search, we recommend that you check all of your online business listings to ensure that your information is accurate. Your name, address, phone number, and hours of operation need to be included with your business listings to ensure that someone can find you in a local search. Additionally, you should optimize your website for mobile users. We recommend building a responsive design website that adjusts based on the type of device that is being used to view it. This will allow your site to have built-in features like click-to-call or click-for-directions. Given how many people conduct a mobile search for a local dentist, this is an easy way to ensure that they call you instead of a dentist down the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, your website needs to be optimized for local search. When creating your SEO strategy, it is important to include your location in multiple places on your site. Think of the phrase that people will use when searching for a dental office in your area (or better yet – have us pull the analytics for you). For example, if you are in Orange County, California, do people search for an “OC dentist”, “Orange County dentist”, etc.? The terms and phrases that they would use should be incorporated into the content on your website, giving your site the opportunity to show up when someone does a local search for a “dentist nearby”. After all, the search engines know where you are located based on the information that you give them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can audit your website to ensure that it is mobile friendly and that you are optimized to show up in a local search. This way you can benefit from the increase in mobile searches for a dentist “near me”.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Use Coupons and Events to Drive Client Conversions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Do you offer coupons and if so, how do they impact your conversions?

This is something that every retailer needs to know and plan for as part of their online marketing. Over the past decade, coupon sites have become more and more popular with affiliates offering a variety of ways to buy something for less money. This can be a good thing when you work with affiliates that have high traffic counts and excellent SEO. After all, the coupons offered on their website can drive more traffic and conversions on yours. The challenge becomes managing the process correctly.

Do you offer coupons and if so, how do they impact your conversions? This is something that every retailer needs to know and plan for as part of their online marketing. Over the past decade, coupon sites have become more and more popular with affiliates offering a variety of ways to buy something for less money. This can be a good thing when you work with affiliates that have high traffic counts and excellent SEO. After all, the coupons offered on their website can drive more traffic and conversions on yours. The challenge becomes managing the process correctly.

In our online marketing plan, be sure to consider how you want to work with your affiliates to ensure that when you do use them to promote coupons, you are not giving up commissions unnecessarily. For example, if someone is in your shopping cart and decides to open a new tab to find a coupon code, the affiliate can track that as a sale using cookies. You will in turn pay a commission, even though the person was on your website first. With that in mind, have your web developer create landing pages and separate URL’s that affiliates can direct traffic to. This will help to keep some of your customers separate. In fact, if you have separate landing pages, you may be able to remove the coupon code section entirely from your main shopping cart. This way the shoppers looking for a discount can come from a coupon site while your regular customers can happily continue paying full price.

One way to successfully use coupons is to create promotions on social media. Your Facebook page, for example, is an excellent place to create a graphic with a coupon code or let everyone know that your new inventory is in and the first fifty customers get a discount. With social media, you can drive conversions because these are people that are already familiar with your brand and want to hear from you. People performing a local search are likely to find your website or your social media page, so this is an excellent way to capture business from that traffic as well.

We also suggest that you create various events to help drive conversions. This can be used in conjunction with local search by optimizing the content on your website. For example, you could have a trunk sale twice a year and incorporate a breadth of content regarding the issue on your website. That way when users search for one in your local area, your website comes up. Next, promote the trunk sale through social media so that your existing customers can participate. Online promotions and events should be fun and creative so keep that in mind and adjust as needed to drive more conversions.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Blog is the Heartbeat of a Company Website]]></title><description><![CDATA[Even if you don’t know much about blogs, it’s probably obvious to you that they have become more and more<a class="moretag" href="/a-blog-is-the-heartbeat-of-a-company-website/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/a-blog-is-the-heartbeat-of-a-company-website/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/a-blog-is-the-heartbeat-of-a-company-website/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2016 22:16:12 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>Even if you don’t know much about blogs, it’s probably obvious to you that they have become more and more popular over the years. You’re probably puzzled about why on earth blogs are so popular. Some people might even think that they seem a waste of time, right? Wrong. Blogging has become the trendy, believable way to market your business, and it’s likely this is a trend that is only going to become more influential and have more power than many other forms of advertising.

The importance of blogging is hard to understand if you don’t understand the basics of what a blog really is. Let’s look at the world of blogs (a.k.a. the “blogosphere”) in a little more detail.

&lt;strong&gt;What is a Blog, anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;
A blog, which used to be referred to as a web log, is an avenue of sharing with others online. When blogging first started it was basically online journaling. These days, blogging has taken on a whole new meaning. Even though many blogs still exist that are solely the voices of random people, sitting at coffee shops or on their couch, looking for a way to share their innermost voices and opinions about random subjects, there are also an entirely different class of blogs. This other “class” of bloggers is focused on marketing businesses, brands and gaining followers who happily look to them for direction in the online marketplace.

Think of a blog as a tour guide. Just like we turn to people we trust and respect for advice on what to do in life, a blog can provide a similar comfort level in the online world.

&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of Blogging?&lt;/strong&gt;
The main reason for any type of marketing is to grow your business. In your case, not only do you want to gain new patients, you want to make sure that you keep your current ones. So how can a blog help you to accomplish those things?

&lt;strong&gt;1. Show those search engines who’s boss.&lt;/strong&gt; Want to be top-ranking when people Google “local dentists”? Posting to a blog is of utmost importance. Think of your company’s website as a heart and your blog as what keeps it beating. A consistently updated blog with current information (you know, the stuff people actually read) will up your ranking, up your traffic and get you more business.

&lt;strong&gt;2. Prove that you know your stuff.&lt;/strong&gt; A blog will help you establish yourself as an authoritative figure that is on top of your specialty. Talk about the trending topics and the latest treatments and procedures and keep people informed. They’ll be more apt to turn to you if they trust you’re education and practices are up to date.

&lt;strong&gt;3. Relate to your patients.&lt;/strong&gt; Showing your patients that you’re not just all business all the time will help them to see you as a person and a friend rather than just a service provider. Building relationships is the best form of marketing and blogging will help you to achieve it. Show your personality and the personality of your staff. Write about causes that interest you or hobbies you enjoy. If they see you as just Dr. Jane, you’re kind of boring. If they know you as Dr. Jane who has two Huskies who used to play roller derby and enjoys sailing, you’re much more exciting.

&lt;strong&gt;Should you BE the Blogger or hire one?
&lt;/strong&gt;Now that you get a sense of why having a blog is so critical to marketing your business online, just how you want to accomplish it is up to you. If you don’t have the time or feel unqualified to start and manage your own blog, there are many blogging services out there that are up to the task. Some business owners enjoy writing their own content, while many others find it simpler and more effective to hire an article writer to take care of it for them.

Being “social” online needs to involve a mix of informational posts with a good portion of personality. No one wants to be bored out of their mind reading posts after post of your business “mission”! Come on! Would you waste your time reading that stuff? Probably not. To get interest and make people want to read your posts they need to be intriguing. Hiring a writer and someone to manage your blog has great benefit for that reason. They’re purpose is to make sure you have a good online presence and your job remains the same: to run your practice.

&lt;strong&gt;How to share content across different social profiles&lt;/strong&gt;
In order to get the most out of your blog, it’s important to make sure your posts are SEEN. The best avenue of spreading blog content is to announce it on various social channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn. Keep in mind that images get much more attention than text alone (and might even be “pinned” on Pinterest). Try posting an image with the content attached. Also, make sure that your posts are accompanied by social media “connect” buttons so that readers can quickly and easily share your images and content across their social scene as well.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learn the Basic Components of SEO]]></title><description><![CDATA[As experts in local SEO, we are asked a lot of questions by businesses regarding what search engine optimization actually<a class="moretag" href="/learn-the-basic-components-of-seo/"> [ More.. ]</a>]]></description><link>https://doctorgenius.com/blog/learn-the-basic-components-of-seo/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doctorgenius.com/blog/learn-the-basic-components-of-seo/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2016 22:07:48 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>As experts in local SEO, we are asked a lot of questions by businesses regarding what search engine optimization actually means and what it involves. For the average business owner, this is an elusive concept that can seem as foreign as a line of code. While most people do not have the time to learn the details of where every link should be placed, it is a good idea for business owners and marketing managers to understand the core concept of SEO, how it works, and why it matters.

&lt;em&gt;the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.&lt;/em&gt;

There are three basic components of SEO, and it all starts with keyword research. You need to know what keywords and questions someone would type into a search engine that could lead them to your website. For example, if you are a pediatric dentist someone could type in your name but if they have never heard of you, what other descriptive words would describe your practice? This list should include your location, the age range of patients that you serve, the procedures that you offer, answers to parent questions about oral health, etc. We can help you to come up with a comprehensive list that is based on statistical research.

Next, you will need on-site optimization. This involves placing keywords throughout your website. They should be included in your on-page content, your titles and meta tags, etc. The overall architecture of your site is also important because it needs to be easy to read and navigate both from a desktop and mobile device. You want to make sure that if someone were to type in a search term, they would arrive at your website and that the content you are providing is what they were expecting to see. Your SEO, website architecture, on-page content and media all need to work together to provide a positive user experience so that your conversions will go up as well.

Lastly, good SEO involves off-site optimization. This is done using avenues like social media. For example, if you send out a Tweet it can include a link back to your website for more information. You can run a contest on Facebook that draws users to your website, etc. Your blog can also be a useful tool for off-site optimization. When done correctly, these three components will work together so that when someone types in a search, your website shows up.

&lt;strong&gt;Why does SEO matter?&lt;/strong&gt;

The majority of U.S. adults own a cell phone and use it to search for things on a regular basis. This is in addition to the millions of people that hop on their computer throughout the day. In fact, Google alone has over 1 billion queries daily. Over ninety percent of men and women use a search engine to find information, a business, purchase something, etc. Additionally, eighty percent of people reported searching for something online and then making a purchase from that local business. In other words, search queries lead to more patients and money to your bottom line. The problem is that if you do not have good SEO, the chance of your website showing up in the list of search results is slim. Fortunately, we have a variety of tools and resources that can help you to change this. To get started, read more of our posts on SEO or give us a call.</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
