After all, you have so many other things to focus on, including patient care. Your social media channel is actually an important part of patient care during this pandemic. As a trusted provider, your patients and other members of the community count on your social media channel now more than ever. Find out how you can use social media marketing for good during the pandemic.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep people informed during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Medical and dental practices always want patients to be healthy. This is even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Misinformation runs rampant online, and providers can cut through the noise to ensure patients know the facts. This is easy to do when using social media.</p>\r\n<h3>Advocate for social distancing</h3>\r\n<p>Many people do not understand the importance of social distancing or even what the phrase “flatten the curve” means. However, many listen to community health care providers. Providers can use social media channels, including Facebook and Twitter, to educate patients. Healthcare providers have influence over the people who follow them. Using that influence during a pandemic is critical for the common good and health of Americans.</p>\r\n<h3>Help people who need to get tested</h3>\r\n<p>With flu and allergy season colliding with the coronavirus, there is a great deal of confusion about who needs to be tested. People are sneezing and coughing their way through the season, and many do not know if they have the virus. Health care providers can use social media channels to explain the symptoms of the virus. Then, people will know if those sneezes and coughs are just allergies, the flu, or something more serious.</p>\r\n<p>Also, providers can give directions for people to follow. Do readers need to visit a provider? Should patients try telemedicine? Maybe social media followers need to self-isolate. Providing this information takes the burden off emergency rooms and urgent care facilities. It also helps people stay healthy.</p>\r\n<h3>Show the steps that the practice is taking to keep people healthy</h3>\r\n<p>People are afraid and want to be reassured. That includes knowing that medical practices and dental offices are taking proper precautions to combat the spread of COVID-19. Practices are encouraged to use social media to explain how they are keeping the office clean and free of contamination. That can include sanitation practices and screening policies.</p>\r\n<h3>Educate about telemedicine</h3>\r\n<p>While the world is focused on COVID-19, Americans still deal with other health issues. Some have high blood pressure, while others take medications that must be monitored. Practices can use social media to educate the public about telemedicine as a viable option. Many people are excited to embrace telemedicine instead of exposing themselves while at an office.</p>\r\n<h2>Make social media part of your public outreach strategy</h2>\r\n<p>Public outreach is more important than ever before. Your patients are nervous and unsure of what to expect. Many will turn to you for advice and information. Speak directly to them through your social media channels. By providing resources and information, you can help limit the spread and ensure that people receive the necessary treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

One<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>During COVID-19, digital marketing is more valuable since more people are staying home and using digital devices more frequently. One way to continue patient acquisition during the pandemic is through online content that increases the chance of social sharing. Social sharing occurs when website visitors share your content on their social platform. This means that a website visitor found your content valuable or inspirational enough for them to want to share it with others on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. </p>\r\n<p>Social shares can noticeably improve the reputation of your practice and the ability to attract visitors who have commercial intent. Finding prospective patients through offline channels is more challenging during COVID-19, so increasing the chance of being found on social media through sharing posts is a great way to limit the financial impact that the pandemic has on your practice.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, there are ways to improve your practice’s chance of receiving social shares. </p>\r\n<h2>The Importance of social sharing</h2>\r\n<p>Content generation is a great way to increase organic traffic to your practice’s website during COVID-19, as well as long-term traffic. Within content marketing are additional marketing goals. The ideal result from content is not just increased traffic but also improved brand recognition and more conversions. One way to achieve this is through more social shares. </p>\r\n<p>Making social sharing a priority is one way that practices can get the most out of their content and weather the storm during the pandemic. The more social shares that a blog post, image, or another form of content gets, the more quality exposure it will receive from prospective patients.</p>\r\n<p>Also, traffic received through social sharing is typically more valuable than traffic directly from search engines. Social sharing means the website visitor found the content through the referral of someone they trust on social media.</p>\r\n<h3>Increasing patient acquisitions through social sharing</h3>\r\n<p>The ultimate goal of content marketing is to increase conversions. Social sharing is a great way to achieve higher conversion rates by improving brand recognition and reaching more prospective clients with valuable content. Social sharing is similar to word of mouth. Word-of-mouth referrals are trusted, typically due to the patient having a quality experience with your practice and telling others about it.</p>\r\n<p>Social sharing works in a similar way. Website visitors who find quality content on your website will want to share it with others through social media. In a similar way as word of mouth, this is often a valuable referral that can improve brand and reputation and ultimately lead to an increase in patient acquisition. During COVID-19, it gives practices a chance to further their marketing goals and continue reaching prospective patients. </p>\r\n<h3>How to encourage and increase social sharing</h3>\r\n<p>There are simple content marketing strategies that practices can implement to increase the chance of receiving social shares. Perhaps most notably, quality content is essential. Visitors are far more likely to share content that they find valuable, intriguing, and inspirational. You can attract the reader’s attention through direct and detailed content and attention-grabbing titles and headers. </p>\r\n<p>It is also essential to have easily accessible share buttons for each piece of content on your website. This encourages the reader to share because they can do so quickly. Another simple and easy tip is to simply ask for a social share, which can be as easy as a short call to action at the end of each piece of content. </p>\r\n<h2>Develop a content strategy with Doctor Genius</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 presents a unique challenge for many practices. If you are like many practices, finding the time to create quality content that increases the chance of social sharing is challenging because there are many other aspects of your business that require your attention.

Schools and businesses have<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/silver-lining-during-this-time-time-with-family-and-time-to-take-time-off/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Most employers and employees feel stressed about COVID-19. This goes beyond the fear of getting sick. Schools and businesses have temporarily shut their doors, and shelter-in-place orders are in effect in most states. Life seemed to change overnight, and it is hard to process. There is a silver lining in this, though. You can take the time to spend with your family.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of family time during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>American families spend an average of 37 minutes of quality time with each other a day, according to a study by Visit Anaheim. Long hours at work, school schedules, and catching up on chores are the main reasons that families cannot spend more time together. Now, however, families are spending hours together each day, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of togetherness. Lear the biggest benefits of spending time together during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<h3>Boost academic performance</h3>\r\n<p>Children who spend ample quality time with parents tend to perform better in school. During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents have become teachers. Parents work alongside their children, helping them complete schoolwork. Many mothers and fathers also use this time to play educational games and impart wisdom to the kids.</p>\r\n<p>When children go back to school after the pandemic, many will be in a better place academically.</p>\r\n<h3>Improve communication skills</h3>\r\n<p>When parents spend most of the time at work or doing chores, it is impossible to model ideal behavior to the kids. Now, with parents at home, they can help children learn communication skills. Acting as models, parents show children the proper way to communicate and behave. Many parents are using the coronavirus pandemic to help children grow into well-adjusted adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Create positive memories</h3>\r\n<p>Positive memories have a lasting impact on people’s well-being. People reach for positive memories during stressful times. These memories remind them that navigating obstacles is possible. Researchers have discovered that children who form positive memories with parents are more tolerant and have better cognitive skills. This also helps with mental health and well-being. As a bonus, those memories are there long after the parents are gone.</p>\r\n<h3>Build stronger mentoring skills</h3>\r\n<p>Adults who spend quality time with family members build stronger mentoring skills. These adults fine-tune these skills while promoting good behavior during family time, and the skills carry over into the workplace. Business owners and employees benefit from developing mentoring skills. After developing the skills, employees and employers can perform better at work. These skills also help people improve the performance of others as well.</p>\r\n<h2>Getting the most out of family time</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 crisis is an uncertain time but use it as a way to bond with your family. Talk frankly about the pandemic with kids and spouse, but do not dwell on the negative. Remember that this is a great time to bond with the people you love the most. Embrace this newfound family time while it is here. Before long, life will return to normal, and you will look back at this time and appreciate the memories you created.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
