In times like these, however, this may be easier said than done. The recent pandemic-designation of COVID-19 puts medical professionals in a particularly unique position. You may be asking yourself what to do if you run out of supplies, no matter what kind of medicine you practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Protective Gear</h2>\r\n<p>As coronavirus continues to spread, it is crucial for medical professionals to keep themselves safe. After all, patients can only be treated if there is someone available to provide professional treatment. This is true regardless of practice type and whether or not the patient is known to have coronavirus. Currently, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> recommends that healthcare workers wear:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Goggles or face shield (for eye protection)</li>\r\n<li>Respirator or medical mask (ideally, an N95 respirator)</li>\r\n<li>Gown (closed securely at the back)</li>\r\n<li>Gloves (pulled up over gown sleeves)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Alternatively, workers may wear powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) that cover the entire head. There is still much we do not yet know about COVID-19. As such, authorities recommend taking higher-level protections until more information on the virus’s transmissibility is known.</p>\r\n<h2>N95 Respirator Shortage</h2>\r\n<p>Hospitals and other healthcare professionals generally only order as many supplies as they anticipate they will need. This, in conjunction with a slew of other factors amid the coronavirus outbreak, has led to a nationwide shortage of N95 respirators.</p>\r\n<p>Healthcare professionals should also advise their patients not to wear respirators or surgical masks unless they are already sick with coronavirus, as this may further contribute to the shortage. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/healthcare-supply-ppe.html\" target=\"_blank\">For most healthy people,</a> wearing respirators and surgical masks will not do much to prevent contracting COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h2>Rationing N95 Respirators</h2>\r\n<p>As the shortage continues to worsen, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/release-stockpiled-N95.html\" target=\"_blank\">the CDC has approved</a> using N95 respirators for “repeated close contact encounters with several patients,” despite being marked as single-use. They may also be used beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, alternative options are available. <a href=\"http://www.wsha.org/wp-content/uploads/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The World Health Organization (WHO)</a> recommends using surgical masks to protect against droplets when N95 respirators are unavailable. Such protection is inadequate, however, when performing aerosol-generating procedures.</p>\r\n<h2>Other Supply Shortages</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/03/us-america-has-fraction-medical-supplies-it-needs-to-combat-coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\">In an interview with National Geographic</a>, senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Center Eric Toner states, “In terms of the amount masks, gowns, gloves, [and] respirators that would be needed.” Toner adds, “I don’t see any reason to think that we would need a different number of those things than we do for a severe pandemic flu.”</p>\r\n<p>The CDC’s models for a potential public health emergency estimate that American healthcare workers will need <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_1/S42/356585\" target=\"_blank\">7,000 to 11,000 mechanical ventilators</a> and <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_1/S42/356585\" target=\"_blank\">100 to 400 million surgical masks</a> for the least to most severe scenarios, respectively. However, anticipating actual supply and demand is difficult when the outbreak’s attack rate is still undetermined.</p>\r\n<h2>What Healthcare Professionals Can Do</h2>\r\n<p>In anticipation of a possible lockdown, healthcare professionals should make sure to supply their patients with a sufficient amount of prescription refills as necessary. It is crucial to take proper precautions and not skip any necessary preventative measures out of fear of running out. Order any masks, gowns, gloves, and respirators while possible, along with any other supplies you anticipate needing. Ration out any supplies carefully and reuse what can be safely reused. If your N95 supplies are running low or you have run out entirely, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html\" target=\"_blank\">follow the CDC protocol</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the U.S. government has incentivized manufacturers to increase the production of surgical masks and respirators by <a href=\"https://qz.com/1811316/us-will-buy-excess-coronavirus-face-masks-to-encourage-production/\" target=\"_blank\">promising to buy any that are left over once demand has run dry</a>. The Strategic National Stockpile, which has a record of proven success during previous epidemics, has also asked manufacturers to <a href=\"https://beta.sam.gov/opp/84a00a52e4e243318a0d2496dc431e36/view?keywords=masks&#038;sort=-modifiedDate&#038;index=&#038;is_active=true&#038;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">submit data on their inventories of personal protective equipment</a>. If necessary, the stockpile may be able to supply healthcare workers with any antibiotics (both oral and antibiotic) and any other medical equipment that could prove useful.</p>\r\n<p>We know that these are stressful times. You want to keep your practice afloat, treat your patients successfully, and protect yourself from the virus all at once. Staying informed and taking steps to prepare may be able to help lessen your anxieties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p><i>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

With the coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51939392\" target=\"_blank\">now confirmed to be circulating in all 50 states,</a> protecting your practice is more critical than ever. At this point, you can safely assume that your office will be exposed to coronavirus at some point or another.</p>\r\n<p>Knowing how to respond can help protect you, your staff, and your patients from the further spread of the disease.</p>\r\n<h2>Taking Preventive Measures</h2>\r\n<p>In response to the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fguidance-business-response.htmll\" target=\"_blank\">interim guidance for businesses and employers</a> to prevent and control the spread of the novel coronavirus. These recommended strategies include encouraging sick employees to stay home and separating sick employees from the rest of the workplace. Employers should restrict workers with fevers of at least 100.4° F from coming in until they have been symptom-free for at least 24 hours without the help of fever-reducing or symptom-altering medicine.</p>\r\n<p>Employers may also need to alter sick leave policies to be more flexible and consistent with public health guidance. From now on, employers should encourage their employees to take off any time they need. Notes from healthcare providers should not be necessary to excuse an absence at this time. Any employee who displays symptoms of respiratory illness upon arrival or during the workday should be separated from others and sent home immediately. If the employee has exposed the workplace to COVID-19, pregnant workers and those <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html\" target=\"_blank\">at higher risk for the virus</a> (i.e., the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions) should not be asked to come into work at all.</p>\r\n<h2>General Guidelines</h2>\r\n<p>Healthcare professionals are at particular risk of interacting with infectious people and having their work environment contaminated. As such, they should take extra precautions accordingly, <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html\" target=\"_blank\">as laid out by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).</a> Some of the regulations can apply to workers in all industries. For example, employees should take care to wash their hands frequently and properly.</p>\r\n<p>This involves scrubbing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content when soap is unavailable. If possible, practice social distancing by staying a minimum of six feet away from others at all times. Of course, in some client-facing practices, this is inapplicable advice. In any case, all healthcare employers should implement OSHA’s infection control strategies based on thorough hazard assessments and utilizing both engineering and administrative controls, along with safe work practices and personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>\r\n<h2>Handling Patients Infected With the Novel Coronavirus</h2>\r\n<p>Engineering controls consist of physically separating any infected patients (or those suspected to be infected) from other patients, ideally in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with proper ventilation. Acceptable alternatives include isolation tents, other portable containment structures, or even just a private room. Any air from the room must exhaust directly outside or, if recirculated, through a HEPA filter. Administrative controls consist of isolating any patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Ideally, those with confirmed cases should even be separated from those with suspected cases. Only a limited number of personnel should enter the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and only with the use of proper PPE. Conducting safe work practices means performing as many tasks as possible in areas away from any patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Do not remain in an isolation room for any longer than necessary. Limit opportunities for touch contamination. Touch clean body sites or surfaces before any dirty or heavily contaminated areas, and avoid touching anything unnecessarily with contaminated gloves.</p>\r\n<p>It is vital to use proper PPE when exposed to a patient who may be infected with the novel coronavirus. The CDC and OSHA recommend healthcare professionals wear eyes/face protection, gowns, gloves, and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified, disposable N95 respirators or better. Do not touch a contaminated piece of PPE without gloves, and always wash hands with soap and water afterward.</p>\r\n<h2>Operating Your Dental Practice During the Pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Of course, providing essential services may look different for different types of healthcare professionals at this time. Recently, the American Dental Association (ADA) <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2020-archive/march/ada-develops-guidance-on-dental-emergency-nonemergency-care\" target=\"_blank\">issued its members with detailed guidance</a> on what to consider dental emergencies and non-emergency dental care.</p>\r\n<p>The ADA has also recommended that dentists all over the country postpone any elective procedures to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. It is important to remember that these guidelines are not static and may continue to change throughout the pandemic. The ADA defines dental emergencies as those occurrences that are potentially life-threatening and call for immediate treatment to stop ongoing tissue bleeding or relieve severe pain or infection.</p>\r\n<p>Dental emergencies may also involve:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Cellulitis or a diffuse soft-tissue bacterial infection with intra- or extra-oral swelling potentially compromising the patient’s airway</li>\r\n<li>Facial trauma potentially compromising the patient’s airway</li>\r\n<li>Uncontrolled bleeding</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Following a New Protocol</h2>\r\n<p>Aside from treating emergencies, dentists should also keep their doors open to patients seeking urgent dental care. Urgent dental care refers to dental conditions requiring immediate attention to relieve the patient of severe pain or risk of infection. These procedures should be treated as minimally invasively as possible and should be performed by dentists whenever possible to ease the load on hospital emergency departments.</p>\r\n<p>Dentists may exercise their own discretion on whether or not a patient requires immediate attention. However, they should be aware that continuing to perform routine or non-urgent dental procedures during the pandemic may contribute to the spread of disease or even lead to a backlash against their practice itself.</p>\r\n<p>In these trying times, we must all stay calm and do what we can to limit the spread of disease. Healthcare professionals must take extra precautions, and staff may need to be trained and retrained as necessary. Now more than ever, it is crucial that we all stand together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

If you have seen <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\" target=\"_blank\">Johns Hopkins University’s heat map of coronavirus COVID-19 global cases,</a> you may be feeling lost and confused about interpreting the actual and logarithmic data, along with the daily cases reported. The high numbers of confirmed cases and deaths may seem intimidating, but what do they really mean in the grand scheme of things?</p> \r\n<h2>Actual vs. Logarithmic Data</h2>\r\n<p>On the Johns Hopkins University graph for actual data, data is spaced out by every 20,000 cases. In other words, the chart is spaced out linearly and evenly. This is known as an arithmetic graph, where equal distances represent equal amounts. Most people are most familiar with this type of chart because of its straightforward nature.</p>\r\n<p>The JHU graph for logarithmic data, however, spaces out data from 10 to 1,000 to 100,000. Instead of representing equal amounts, equal distances represent equal rates. In this case, each distance represents 10%. This makes it more useful in comparing rates of change.</p>\r\n<h2>Daily Rates of COVID-19 Growth</h2>\r\n<p>It would be easy to interpret the JHU graph for actual data as proof that the daily rates of (1) novel coronavirus growth outside of mainland China and (2) total recovered worldwide have been skyrocketing since February. Looking at this graph may be disheartening, as it seems to indicate an unstoppable daily uptick in novel coronavirus cases.</p>\r\n<p>However, the logarithmic data shows us that the daily growth rates of COVID-19 outside of mainland China are <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-data-do-not-support-global-alarmism-by-anatole-kaletsky-2020-03\" target=\"_blank\">actually slowing down.</a></p>\r\n<h2>Interpreting COVID-19 Maps</h2>\r\n<p>Some may also find it panic-inducing to look at JHU’s map. It is crucial to remember that the data presented does not give viewers an idea of the number of cases relative to the population. In other words, the map is using actual data. By failing to list population numbers and focusing only on COVID-19-related statistics, the map may render viewers unable to establish a baseline for comparison.</p>\r\n<p>JHU’s map partially compensates for this by implementing proportional symbols in marking each region, meaning larger circles represent larger numbers of cumulative confirmed cases. Thus, viewers may be able to see which countries are more affected than others — though not proportionately so.</p>\r\n<h2>Significance of Current Data</h2>\r\n<p>The actual data suggests that cases exploded in mainland China from mid-January to early February before finally beginning to flatten out in mid-February. Additionally, the graph indicates that the total recovery rate has been on the rise. Logarithmic data confirms both of these assumptions while simultaneously showing that recovery rates may be leveling out — likely correlated with the overall slowing of new COVID-19 diagnoses.</p>\r\n<p>All of this indicates that flattening the curve is still very possible, provided individuals <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/\" target=\"_blank\">stick to necessary precautions like social distancing.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the high numbers reported in COVID-19 statistics may be intimidating, they must be taken in context. Understanding how to correctly interpret the data on COVID-19 is imperative in reducing sensationalism and panic. Staying calm and keeping a clear head can help aid you in taking the preventative steps needed to keep both yourself and those around you safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
