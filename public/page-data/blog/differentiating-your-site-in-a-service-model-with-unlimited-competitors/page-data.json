So long as<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/differentiating-your-site-in-a-service-model-with-unlimited-competitors/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Once upon a time, consumers choose their health care providers based on proximity and services they provided. So long as providers could fulfill potential patients’ needs on those two factors alone, there was little reason for them to differentiate themselves from the competition. Today, however, that is no longer the case.</p>\r\n<h2>Web design strategies to set your practice apart from the competition</h2>\r\n<p>Today, if health care providers wish to attract new patients and keep existing ones, they must set themselves apart from the competition. While a big portion of the patient experience takes place in office, it really begins online. These digital marketing strategies can help your site stand out from the rest:</p>\r\n<h3>Play with format</h3>\r\n<p>Some types of content prove more effective than others in terms of engagement and rankings, but at Doctor Genius, we know from experience that no single type of content will appeal to every visitor. It makes sense to vary your content from time to time, even if doing so goes against the status quo for your industry. As a health care provider, you likely use long-form articles, short blog posts, original research, and case studies as the foundation of your strategy. However, you can expand your reach and grow your audience by incorporating one or more of the following formats as well:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Infographics</li>\r\n\t<li>Quizzes and polls</li>\r\n\t<li>Podcasts</li>\r\n\t<li>Webinars</li>\r\n\t<li>Email newsletters</li>\r\n\t<li>Video</li>\r\n\t<li>Health checklists</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Fill the gaps in competitors’ messaging</h3>\r\n<p>To differentiate yourself from the competition, Forbes suggests <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3\">stalking your competitors online</a>. Visit their websites, follow their blogs, like their Facebook pages, sign up for their email newsletters, and listen to their podcasts. Make note of the topics they routinely discuss and identify gaps. By either expanding on tired topics or broaching new ones, you can position yourself as an industry thought leader, an invaluable position to hold in the health or dental field.</p>\r\n<h3>Offer virtual tours</h3>\r\n<p>The health care industry has the unique challenge of helping potential patients overcome their phobias before they even schedule an appointment. One effective way to do this is through <a href=\"https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.\">virtual tours</a>. These allow potential patients to get to know every facet of your practice and to familiarize themselves with the environment before they set foot in your office. They also let you showcase special amenities you may have, such as X-ray machines, special kids’ activity areas, and recovery rooms. Live tours, especially those that contain voiceover narration, can give website visitors much-needed reassurance that you prioritize their comfort.</p>\r\n<h3>Use real photos</h3>\r\n<p>Visual elements are such an important part of any website, but not all imagery is created equal. According to findings from a Marketing Experiments study, prospective customers are <a href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested\">35% more likely to convert</a> when presented with real imagery as opposed to stock photos. While there are several reasons behind this, the takeaway is simple: Always use real photos when possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn about the PX, Patient Experience Package</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we pride ourselves on our ability to help clients build a custom branding and patient experience through digital marketing efforts.

Among those challenges is your ability to incite trust in prospective patients, demonstrate competency of care, and encourage prospects to choose you over your competitors — all before they ever set foot in your office. While an up-to-date website, strong content, and patient reviews can go a long way toward helping you overcome several marketing challenges, original photos and detailed imagery may be just what you need to overcome the unique three.</p>\r\n<h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>\r\n<p>You can invest all your resources into beautiful web design, informative content, and strategic SEO, but without supplementing your efforts with high-quality imagery, your efforts may be for naught. According to Solve, websites that feature “good images” receive <a href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\">94% more views</a> than those without photos or with low-quality images. Moreover, substandard photos may hurt your practice more than a lack of photos, as low-grade pictures send the impression that your brand is cheap, impersonal, and untrustworthy. The right photos, however, can do the opposite and help your practice overcome challenges one, two, and three.</p>\r\n<h3>Build trust</h3>\r\n<p>Original photography is one of the best ways to build trust in prospective patients. Real images give prospects a glimpse of who you are as a provider and what type of community you have created in-office. Genuine smiles on the faces of real patients and team members help prospects feel reassured that you operate a warm, welcome, and caring environment and that people are happy to be in your care.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, before and after photos of real patients let you live up to the adage of “show, don’t tell.” It is easy enough to state on your website that you specialize in full-mouth restorations, but convincing patients that this is true requires proof. An image gallery with clearly labeled before and after photos can serve as all the evidence you need, though it cannot hurt to accompany images with patient testimonials as well.</p>\r\n<h3>Demonstrate competency of care</h3>\r\n<p>Trust and competency go hand in hand. If a prospect does not trust that you can competently manage his or her care, he or she will not choose you despite your other redeeming qualities. Use imagery to provide a comprehensive and visual overview of your services, procedures, and outcomes, such as what we did with our <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\">new Doctor Genius video</a>. If you use high-tech equipment in your practice, go beyond original photos and use videos to demonstrate how it works. Do not be afraid to play with photos and video to guide prospects through the patient journey so they know what to expect. Finally, use imagery to educate patients on your services, address common health issues, and provide tips for how patients can protect their health.</p>\r\n<h3>Differentiate your brand</h3>\r\n<p>Last but not least, original photos are an effective way to set yourself apart from the competition. Whereas many brands still rely on stock imagery, whether because of time, cost, or unawareness, you can set your brand apart by offering a wholly transparent and honest look at your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Attract more patients with tailored solutions</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we focus solely on developing comprehensive digital marketing solutions for health care professionals.

This increases the chances that more people will read your post, which in turn increases the chances of gaining new patients. At Doctor Genius, we can help improve your content management to attract more clients. Along with using the right keywords, it is also important to understand what a salience score refers to.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding salience</h2>\r\n<p>Salience refers to the importance of a language feature within a text. In other words, the language that the writer uses in the web copy helps a search engine understand the true nature of the website. Machine learning technology helps to predict which words or concepts are deemed more important by those reading the text, and writers should strive to incorporate them.</p>\r\n<p>These days, writing content is about more than just getting leads. The content must be helpful and of high quality, which is why <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-speaking-to-a-general-audience/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-speaking-to-a-general-audience/\">tailoring the information</a> is important.  </p>\r\n<h2>How to improve the salience score</h2>\r\n<p>A salience score is what language processors assign to language and words in web copy. The higher the score, the more important it is.</p>\r\n<h3>Use entities in the copy</h3>\r\n<p>To improve the salience score and, ultimately, search ranking, Inc.com talks about how you must <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/david-amerland/a-smart-trick-to-help-your-business-rank-in-google-searches.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.inc.com/david-amerland/a-smart-trick-to-help-your-business-rank-in-google-searches.html\">include entities</a> in one way or another. Doing this causes a search engine, such as Google for example, to calculate the text differently. It may be challenging knowing what words to use, but Google does have an Application Programming Interface that writers can use to see what score the copy would be assigned. Just insert your text into the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\">API demo</a> to see if you should make any changes.</p>\r\n<h3>Position text properly</h3>\r\n<p>Readers tend to place more importance on the beginning of a sentence. To improve your salience score, make sure the topic’s focus is at the start. This may take grammatical tricks to change word order to place emphasis on the topic.</p>\r\n<h3>Increase the number of references to the entity</h3>\r\n<p>You may be able to improve your score if you make more references to the entity. If possible, use different terms that refer to the same recognizable entity. Do this naturally, and skip it if it seems forced, as if you mention the entity too much, it can hurt the score.</p>\r\n<h3>Make the entity the focus in complex sentences</h3>\r\n<p>Search engines like Google are able to perform complex functions that identify linguistic relationships in longer sentences. Language processors can understand the relationships between the subject, object, and verb, and if the entity remains the main focus, the score is higher.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about improving your salience score</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is your source for a variety of online marketing services.
