Doctor<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/doctor-genius-university-presents-cash-flow-matters-with-bob-affleck/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><b>Refinance, Rebuild, and Restore: Doctor Genius Works With Bob Affleck To Show That Refinance Is Only The First Step.</b></p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius has partnered with Bob Affleck, our resident Practice Financial Expert, to bring practices across the US a strategic plan and loan to refinance. He has been working alongside our team to aid practices through this unprecedented time. With the legislators across the US lifting restrictions put in place during the pandemic, medical practices having a clear roadmap on how to proceed with reopening is paramount. Along with having the appropriate PPE, scheduling appointments with limited hours of operation, communicating with patients, and more, practices need to have a plan to rebuild their office for the present and in the future. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to have world-class talent like Bob Affleck ready to help practices create a plan to rebuild and restore. </p>\r\n<h2>What is Cash Flow Matters with Bob Affleck?</h2>\r\n<p>Our Cash Flow Matters webinar series strives to help dental and medical practice owners attain the practice growth and success they desire. When it comes to enhancing your practice, finances are a crucial aspect of your success. I>t&#8217;s also important to know what&#8217;s changed in financing since quarantine went into effect, which is why speaking to an industry expert can prepare you to seek improved cash flow.</p>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 20px;/* padding:20px!important; */margin:40px auto;width: 80%;font-size:1.2rem;\" class=\"btn btn-block btn-dark\"><a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/bobaffleck\" style=\"text-decoration:none;padding: 20px;width: 100%;height: 100%;display: block;\"><span style=\"\">Click Here</span><span style=\"color: white\"> to learn more about our program and how it can benefit your practice today!</span></a></div>\r\n<p><b><i>Who is Bob Affleck?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>Bob Affleck is a financial expert who has dedicated the past 30 years to helping thousands of dentists realize their dream of practice ownership and achieve the practice growth they desire. Cash Flow Matters is &#8220;Not just about running a practice but being able to grow the practice, as well.&#8221; With Bob Affleck, he explains that this is about helping practices &#8220;Make the comeback stronger than the setback.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>With experience as a practice finance specialist, a practice management consultant, and a practice broker, Affleck now works as an advisor and educator for dentists. With experience from the dental industry at all angles, Affleck has the expertise to help guide clients from the beginning of their career and onward.</p>\r\n<p><b><i>What Can the Cash Flow Matters Webinar do For Me?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>By working with Affleck, this webinar demonstrates to clients how refinancing is a crucial step, but it is only the first step. While most dental practices have been in survival mode for the last few months, it is essential to begin thinking past tomorrow. </p>\r\n<p>Following the refinancing, it is crucial to have a plan. Through this webinar, we can help clients take their practice from survive to thrive. That begins with a sound online presence fueled by relevant, high-quality content. The Cash Flow Matters Webinar will help you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li >Understand your current practice finances</li>\r\n\t<li >Refinance</li>\r\n\t<li >Rebuild</li>\r\n\t<li >Restore</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/\">Doctor Genius Practice Recovery Blueprint</a>, we go into detail on how Next Level Practice and Doctor Genius are partnered up to provide an opportunity for practice owners to bounce back.  This can help clients focus on reopening their practice. Now, we are delving more deeply into the aspects involving refinancing.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding Your Current Practice Finances</h2>\r\n<p>To help your practice grow and achieve the success you desire, it is essential to gain an understanding of your current finances. This includes reviewing all current practice loans, equipment loans, credit card debt, or other outstanding debt. We will also need to review the practice&#8217;s ongoing costs for PPE, staff, and monthly expenses. From here, we can better evaluate what your practice needs.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to understanding your current practice finances, we will focus on several areas, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li >Free up cash flows</li>\r\n\t<li >Rebuild cash reserves</li>\r\n\t<li >Invest in Health and Safety Equipment</li>\r\n\t<li >Invest in Marketing to Promote Safe Practice</li>\r\n\t<li >Drive Profitability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius works with Bob Affleck to help practices strengthen and build upon the resources they need while also promoting their message to their healthcare communities and their patients. By evaluating your current finances, together, we can help customize a loan plan for how to begin the process of building a more stable financial foundation for a  successful practice in the future.</p>\r\n<h2>Refinance</h2>\r\n<p>After understanding a client&#8217;s current finances, we can focus on refinancing. This process involves consolidating practice debt, freeing up cash flow, debt cash out, and other services we offer in our Recovery Blueprint plan.</p>\r\n<p><b><i>What will consolidating practice debt do for me?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>By organizing all unsecured debts into one monthly payment, we can help to establish the most effective payment system for it.  By using a loan to consolidate debt, you will be able to make one payment covering multiple debts instead of spending more time and resources keeping track of multiple payments. Affleck can help clients learn what they need in order to succeed.</p>\r\n<p><b><i>In what other ways will this benefit the future of my practice?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>In our most recent <a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/bobaffleck\">webinar</a>, Affleck states that his goal is to educate clients &#8220;on what it takes to grow the practice,&#8221; and that, to do this, the &#8220;<i>Most important part is about understanding the business side of the practice.&#8221;</i> We are here to help you do that and begin the process of rebuilding a firm financial foundation beneath your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Rebuild</h2>\r\n<p>Part of rebuilding a practice includes implementing a new message and marketing platform. This message can incorporate your beliefs and overall goal for your practice while targeting keywords that promote your services. Doctor Genius can combine your message with SEO-focused content to help boost the chance of people finding your website in internet searches. This can also include content that goes over new health and safety measures in a post-COVID-19 world.</p>\r\n<p>Content has been vital for keeping our clients engaged with their community during the pandemic. After completing a full performance audit on all Doctor Genius clients, our team found that they&#8217;ve been experiencing more visibility to their sites. We also found that people were enjoying and reading the content on our client&#8217;s websites to help them make informed decisions about their health. More people are reading blogs, spending more time on practice websites, and learning more about the services they need to make an informed decision. To continuously see positive results, it&#8217;s essential to understand the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">importance of social media, videos, and how to create effective blogs</a>. </p>\r\n<p><b><i>How do You market necessary dental care to patients in these trying times?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>A relevant concern patients have at this time is their safety when receiving dental care. We can help to promote any messages of having the proper equipment and taking all necessary measures to ensure the health of each patient. Your patients likely desire dental treatment even at this time; they just need the right message for them to feel comfortable returning.</p>\r\n<p><b><i>Can you customize the website to my specific services?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>Yes. Along with customizing the content to specific services, we can help to fine-tune your systems to promote profitability. Affleck is here to help clients maximize the potential of profit for their practice. By working with us to rebuild your practice, we can help place your practice on the path toward success.</p>\r\n<h2>Restore</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to helping restore a practice, the Cash Flow Matters Webinar focuses on strengthening practice efficiencies and experiences. Similar to sending out a personalized message for potential patients, your website can also send a reassuring message to staff members. The goal of restoring a practice is more than merely boosting revenue. This process can also help clients discover new patient opportunities and methods of delivering quality care to patients.</p>\r\n<p>If you are looking to restore your practice and begin working with a system that promotes more success in the future, then we can help.

When it comes to dental practices, patients still need dental treatment, urgent services, and information on what constitutes a dental emergency. It is the same way with all forms of medical care.</p>\r\n<p>People are wondering how and when to reach out to medical professionals or businesses for how and when they can seek services. While the government is taking the time to iron out the details of re-opening the economy, medical practices can benefit from understanding what is going to happen and what the plan is for small businesses.</p>\r\n<h2>When and how to support local businesses</h2>\r\n<p>Local businesses play essential roles in the nation’s economy. Communities grow and experience more innovations due to local establishments by creating jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities and support the community. They care about the community making the town stand out among others.</p>\r\n<p>Such businesses are dealing with financial strain currently and face uncertainty about the future. The following are ways to support local businesses during the COVID-19 crisis:</p>\r\n<h3>Order from local stores</h3>\r\n<p>For those who can afford to, it would certainly help if they tried their local stores or restaurants first when they need to buy something. Many restaurants now offer pickups and deliveries. Other places like the local toy store, spas, hair salon, hardware store, and childcare provider may not be selling from their physical stores, but they could be offering delivery and curbside pickup options.</p>\r\n<p>Buy gift cards or credit for future use from them. Some of these local stores may have adjusted their services to meet up demands in this period. For instance, local cleaners may now offer disinfecting services, and the toy store may have added homeschool supplies. For those who still have the financial means, it might help to keep paying workers like the hairstylist, nanny, and cleaners. They are usually hit the hardest because fewer people will be requesting their services.</p>\r\n<h3>Avoid refunds and continue subscriptions</h3>\r\n<p>Check online to see if any of the services are now available online. Service providers like tutors, personal trainers, yoga instructors, financial planners, coaches, music teachers, and lawyers — all of them can continue to render their services online via videos or online conferencing.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to pay for memberships and subscriptions, even if the services have been stopped temporarily. If payment has been sent for a canceled class, one may consider donating the money to the organization instead of requesting a refund. Alternatively, one can postpone booked services to a later date instead of canceling.</p>\r\n<h3>Share the services online</h3>\r\n<p>If a local business is offering special promotions or ideas, sharing it online might help increase its reach. Since local businesses do not often have great marketing efforts, their customers can help them share the news over social media. Those who are website designers, developers, or social media experts can render their services to local businesses without an online presence to promote their deals and sales online.</p>\r\n<h3>Give tips</h3>\r\n<p>When ordering takeaway goods from local restaurants, try to be more generous than usual, if possible. The extra funds, no matter how little, can help businesses and their staff who still have to work, as well as delivery people who typically work on a contract basis and have unstable wages.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us To Learn More Today</h2>\r\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and self-isolating rules are critical for curbing the spread of the disease but devastating for local businesses.

During this is time, communities want all the information they can get to stay abreast of the situation. Doctor Genius is here to help dentists, and medical professionals stay ahead of the pandemic with a variety of services to boost their online presence.</p>\r\n<p>We can help you take the necessary steps to continue promoting your practice during this time. We will guide you through using technology and methods of communication to stay in contact with your patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Maintaining a Line of Communication</h2>\r\n<p>The following are five tips for dental practices who want to use technology for conventional communication and maintain a connection with their communities:</p>\r\n<h3>Livestream with Facebook</h3>\r\n<p>Dentists and medical practices can use software to release the latest news about their operations, which will not only help address several concerns at a time but also connect the community during the lockdown. In many cases, a live stream video can make it easier for patinets to hear about available services, operating hours, updates on re-opening policies, and current health precautions your team is taking.</p>\r\n<p>Video conferencing services like Zoom, Facebook Livestream, and Google Hangouts are quick ways to engage the community while also providing video recordings for those who did not join the live session. If you are unsure how to utilize these services or want to learn how we can help, reach out to our team.</p>\r\n<h3>Post press releases on social media</h3>\r\n<p>The media is shifting from traditional news release platforms to one where news channels are looking online for details instead of reading reports. By posting press releases with information for patients, you can further the chance of potential patients seeing that your practice. This is also an opportunity to post about if you are providing emergency services or opening for specific types of treatment. During this time, reaching as many patients as possible is crucial.</p>\r\n<h3>Use eNewsletters to provide best practices and tips about staying at home</h3>\r\n<p>An effective way to share information is to leverage technologies used regularly by the entire community. Producing and sharing newsletters using web platforms allows people to stay informed easily, feel a connection with the community, and stay updated with the latest information about what is going on during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<p>This is also a way to help patients know when they may need to seek treatment for certain dental issues or emergencies. Now more than ever, patients are in need of that advice since most offices are closed or under limited operating hours.</p>\r\n<h3>Use social media to provide daily updates to the community</h3>\r\n<p>Everyone uses social media nowadays, a fact that can be optimized. There are different forms for proactive communication, and providing vital information on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook is a seamless way to reassure people. At this time, people are looking for guides and want to stay informed on the latest updates from reliable sources. Even a picture or brief summary can deliver a strong message.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us Today</h2>\r\n<p>As the world deals with the changes in society due to the COVID-19 pandemic, dental practices and leaders must find ways to keep their employees and community informed, while easing their concerns.
