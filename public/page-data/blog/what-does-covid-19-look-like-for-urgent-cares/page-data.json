These clinics are screening and testing patients. The offices also refer them to emergency rooms when necessary. The pandemic has forced urgent care facilities to change the way they operate for the time being. Steps are being taken to protect employees and patients during this difficult time.</p>\r\n<h2>Urgent care on the frontlines of COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Urgent care facilities currently have two main objectives for COVID-19. First, the facilities want to limit the spread of this highly contagious disease. Second, the facilities want to ensure that sick patients receive the necessary treatment. To accomplish both objectives, offices have changed business models for the time being.</p>\r\n<h3>Telehealth screenings</h3>\r\n<p>Urgent care facilities realize that reducing the number of patients in waiting rooms is vital. Having fewer people in waiting rooms slows the spread of the disease. Many urgent care offices use online screening and telehealth to determine if people are likely to have coronavirus. Those who do not pass the screening might have to go to a testing facility instead of the office.</p>\r\n<h3>Limiting the time in waiting rooms</h3>\r\n<p>Many urgent care offices are also allowing patients to wait in vehicles in the parking lot after checking in. Also, many are offering curbside service. These practices reduce the time spent in the waiting room. The methods protect patients and providers.</p>\r\n<h3>Providing masks when necessary</h3>\r\n<p>Some urgent care facilities provide protective masks for patients. Patients can call ahead before going to the appointment. The screening takes place during the call. Then, a staff member meets the patient at the door and provides the mask if needed. As an added precaution, these facilities also wipe down the door handles and everything else the patient touches.</p>\r\n<h3>Ruling out other conditions</h3>\r\n<p>Urgent care centers are also playing a vital role in providing flu tests for patients. Many people who think they have coronavirus have seasonal flu. After consulting with the provider, patients can come in for the flu test. If the flu test comes back negative, the facility might recommend a coronavirus test.</p>\r\n<h3>Dealing with overflow patients</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has overwhelmed medical facilities. Some states allow retired providers to join the fight against the disease. These providers do not need to undergo the recertification process. This puts them on the frontlines now. Hospitals need this to meet current patient demand.</p>\r\n<p>Urgent care facilities help overwhelmed hospitals by providing other types of care. For example, patients with urinary tract infections or animal bites can visit the urgent care facility. This takes the strain from the overburdened hospitals. It also makes it easier for hospitals to care for COVID-19 patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Urgent care facilities are part of the team fighting COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Urgent care facilities always play an important role in health care. That role is on the frontlines during the COVID-19 crisis. Many facilities have changed business practices for the time being. These facilities also take the burden off overwhelmed hospitals. With urgent care facilities on the frontlines, the system runs smoother. This helps everyone receive the necessary care.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Whether you are providing emergency services or are<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/good-office-sanitation-practices/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Preventing the spread of COVID-19 is critical for medical and dental offices. Whether you are providing emergency services or are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, sanitation should be a top priority. Due to the highly contagious nature of this virus, you need to take extra steps to keep germs at bay. Along with keeping your office clean, these sanitation practices will also help your patients relax when they visit your office.</p>\r\n<h2>How to keep offices clean during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Offices must start by gathering the proper cleaning supplies. That includes supplies for the people doing the cleaning, as well as any supplies the office team needs. Those who take on the cleaning duties should use a mask, gown, and gloves to protect themselves from the virus. These items should be thrown away after cleaning.</p>\r\n<p>Cleaning supplies include a soap and water solution or detergent. Offices should also use EPA-approved disinfectant to remove the virus from surfaces. Commercial disinfectants can help to clean both porous and nonporous surfaces. Employees must follow the instructions on the disinfectant to optimize the results.</p>\r\n<h3>Clean nonporous surfaces</h3>\r\n<p>After putting on the necessary PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), staff members should use a soap and water solution or detergent to clean nonporous surfaces. This removes COVID-19 particles when present, making the disinfectant more effective. After cleaning the surfaces, staff members should use a disinfectant. Then, the team needs to remove the equipment before employees wash their hands for a minimum of 20 seconds.</p>\r\n<h3>Clean often-forgotten places</h3>\r\n<p>While most offices do a good job of cleaning the obvious spots, many employees forget certain germ-prone areas. If left alone, these spots could become a breeding ground for germs. Fortunately, this is avoided by adding often-forgotten items to the daily cleaning list. Employees must clean:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Phones</li>\r\n\t<li>Doorknobs</li>\r\n\t<li>Printers and copy machines</li>\r\n\t<li>Walls</li>\r\n\t<li>Picture frames</li>\r\n\t<li>Toilet flushers</li>\r\n\t<li>Light switches</li>\r\n\t<li>Floor baseboards</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Depending on how often these items are touched, they might need to be cleaned several times a day or once a day. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people cannot overclean the office. Employers should consider a cleaning schedule for employees to follow. Also, employees should clean any items that have been touched.</p>\r\n<h3>Keep hand sanitizers available for public use</h3>\r\n<p>Sanitation goes beyond cleaning and disinfecting the office. Employers should keep hand sanitizers throughout the office for public use, including a sanitizer by the reception desk and the seating area. Sanitizers should also be in treatment rooms for patients to use.</p>\r\n<h3>Use masks when social distancing is not possible</h3>\r\n<p>Regardless of how clean an office is, it is still possible to spread COVID-19. Social distancing measures require that people stay at least six feet apart, but that is not always possible in a medical or dental office. Staff should use masks when social distancing is impossible. This will protect patients who encounter the staff.</p>\r\n<h2>Create a sanitation plan to fight COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 spreads quickly, and good sanitation is one of the top ways to fight it. While you cannot completely prevent the spread of COVID-19, you can do your part by keeping your office sanitized. Also, make sure your employees and patients have access to hand sanitizer and PPE if needed. This is a stressful time for many providers, but sanitizing your office is a good way to protect yourself, your staff, and your patients.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

One<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>During COVID-19, digital marketing is more valuable since more people are staying home and using digital devices more frequently. One way to continue patient acquisition during the pandemic is through online content that increases the chance of social sharing. Social sharing occurs when website visitors share your content on their social platform. This means that a website visitor found your content valuable or inspirational enough for them to want to share it with others on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. </p>\r\n<p>Social shares can noticeably improve the reputation of your practice and the ability to attract visitors who have commercial intent. Finding prospective patients through offline channels is more challenging during COVID-19, so increasing the chance of being found on social media through sharing posts is a great way to limit the financial impact that the pandemic has on your practice.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, there are ways to improve your practice’s chance of receiving social shares. </p>\r\n<h2>The Importance of social sharing</h2>\r\n<p>Content generation is a great way to increase organic traffic to your practice’s website during COVID-19, as well as long-term traffic. Within content marketing are additional marketing goals. The ideal result from content is not just increased traffic but also improved brand recognition and more conversions. One way to achieve this is through more social shares. </p>\r\n<p>Making social sharing a priority is one way that practices can get the most out of their content and weather the storm during the pandemic. The more social shares that a blog post, image, or another form of content gets, the more quality exposure it will receive from prospective patients.</p>\r\n<p>Also, traffic received through social sharing is typically more valuable than traffic directly from search engines. Social sharing means the website visitor found the content through the referral of someone they trust on social media.</p>\r\n<h3>Increasing patient acquisitions through social sharing</h3>\r\n<p>The ultimate goal of content marketing is to increase conversions. Social sharing is a great way to achieve higher conversion rates by improving brand recognition and reaching more prospective clients with valuable content. Social sharing is similar to word of mouth. Word-of-mouth referrals are trusted, typically due to the patient having a quality experience with your practice and telling others about it.</p>\r\n<p>Social sharing works in a similar way. Website visitors who find quality content on your website will want to share it with others through social media. In a similar way as word of mouth, this is often a valuable referral that can improve brand and reputation and ultimately lead to an increase in patient acquisition. During COVID-19, it gives practices a chance to further their marketing goals and continue reaching prospective patients. </p>\r\n<h3>How to encourage and increase social sharing</h3>\r\n<p>There are simple content marketing strategies that practices can implement to increase the chance of receiving social shares. Perhaps most notably, quality content is essential. Visitors are far more likely to share content that they find valuable, intriguing, and inspirational. You can attract the reader’s attention through direct and detailed content and attention-grabbing titles and headers. </p>\r\n<p>It is also essential to have easily accessible share buttons for each piece of content on your website. This encourages the reader to share because they can do so quickly. Another simple and easy tip is to simply ask for a social share, which can be as easy as a short call to action at the end of each piece of content. </p>\r\n<h2>Develop a content strategy with Doctor Genius</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 presents a unique challenge for many practices. If you are like many practices, finding the time to create quality content that increases the chance of social sharing is challenging because there are many other aspects of your business that require your attention.
