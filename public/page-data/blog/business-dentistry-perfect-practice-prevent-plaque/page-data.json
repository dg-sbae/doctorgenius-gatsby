In fact, a lack of understanding on the business side of any practice can be a private practice’s downfall. Fortunately, along with other professional companies, Doctor Genius provides the necessary advice for effectively starting your own practice in today’s industry.\r\n\r\n<h3>Learn the most effective tips of the trade</h3>\r\n\r\nThe “Business of Dentistry” event takes place from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 4, 2017, at Park Plaza in Irvine, California. Affiliates and speakers of this event include professionals from companies such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Burkhart</li>\r\n \t<li>Mostofi Law Group</li>\r\n \t<li>HR for Health</li>\r\n \t<li>Bank of America Corp.®</li>\r\n \t<li>JLL® (Jones, Lang, LaSalle Incorporated)</li>\r\n \t<li>Nickerson Consulting</li>\r\n \t<li>Practice CFO</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe event is an effective opportunity for dental professionals to learn the crucial information one needs for success in the industry. This event can help professionals looking to acquire an existing practice or start their own. Many dental professionals have all the necessary degree, knowledge and expertise on dentistry to provide high-quality dental work, but do not know how to begin their own practice.\r\n\r\nWith this team of professionals, attendees will be able to earn 7 CE credits for the one-day event. Acquiring a practice or starting a new is much more than just buying the property and starting a company Facebook page.\r\n\r\n<h3>Reach more potential patients</h3>\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july25-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-651\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july25-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july25-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july25-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 300px; border-left: 3px solid #666666; margin-center: 1px; padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 20px;\"> Do not miss out on the opportunity to start your dental practice with a strong foot forward.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Genius has the necessary tools and expertise to help clients reach large amounts of potential patients online. We develop a custom website for each client’s practice with the necessary language and structure to rank in Google search results. This event will cover the basics of how to begin that process. We will also cover the details of acquiring a practice and how to continue running a dental practice.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we understand that navigating the digital market can be difficult. With a variety of odd and sometimes cumbersome requirements, it is no wonder that other dental practices fall into obscurity. Let our services help prevent that from happening. There is no reason that you have to attempt to build your own dental practice without professional business expertise.\r\n  \r\n<p>This event can be the first step in marketing your practice for a brighter and more successful future. With a variety of guest speakers, this event is set to be an experience that you do not want to miss.

Fortunately, there are specific steps that one can take to reach a higher level of healthy online activity and success. The team at Doctor Genius has the knowledge and expertise to utilize the correct keywords for a client’s website and help increase their ranking online. However, effective keywords are more than simply choosing any words related to a field of medicine.\r\n<h3>What are keywords?</h3>\r\nKeywords are words or phrases that match up with terms people type in search engines online. For instance, Google explains that, “Selecting high quality, relevant keywords for your advertising campaign can help you reach the customers you want, when you want.” With so many possible terms and phrases to use, it is crucial and beneficial to invest in the services of someone who understands how to pick effective keywords.\r\n\r\nKeywords will help a professional’s website show up higher in list results of searches. This way, our clients can have their websites rank higher on search results and increase website traffic for the chance of gaining new patients. In 2015, Advanced Web Ranking found that there is a 31.5 percent click through rate for the number one position on mobile Google search results.\r\n\r\n<h3>How do keywords work?</h3>\r\nBy choosing keywords that people commonly type in search engines, your website will have a stronger chance of appearing at the top section of the search results. For instance, a common keyword can be “Emergency Dentist,” or “Whitening.” By making these keywords, people who type that word or phrase into a search engine most likely find your website before others.\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers went to a store within five miles of their home after completing a local search.<p></div>\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not as simple as flooding a website with keywords and waiting by the phone.\r\n\r\n<h3>How do you select effective keywords?</h3>\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-660\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, members of our professional team help you select the keywords that are effective in ranking and pertain to your professional services. With so many methods for selecting keywords, it can be easy to select an ineffective or faulty service. Thus, Doctor Genius will help you select the effective keywords to enhance your website.\r\n\r\nWe can also help clients use keywords that market to the local area. In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers went to a store within five miles of their home after completing a local search. It is crucial to select keywords that will rank in that area.\r\n<h3>Should I only focus on keywords?</h3>\r\nWhile keywords are an important tool for any professional’s website, they are not the only tool a professional needs. A website needs constant updates to show Google that it is active while also utilizing reviews that are a huge factor in ranking. Doctor Genius can help keep a website active and monitor social media accounts of the practice to help increase that rate of potential patients.\r\n\r\nTo answer the question, “Are Keywords Effective?” The answer is yes. However, effective keywords are only part of a much larger set of tools necessary to communicate with Google effectively. If you are interested in our services or more information about keywords, give us a call today.\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

A professional can have a website of the most eloquent prose or custom-made images from a graphic designer and still not rank very high in search results. The key is learning to understand and speak the languages of Google and the digital market.  Fortunately, Doctor Genius is fluent in several digital languages to help our clients stand out.\r\n\r\n<h3>An active blog says more than 1,000 words</h3>\r\n\r\nWhile clients may want a certain look or feel for a website, the website needs to match up with Google’s requirements in order to rank on search engines. We can ensure that the website is both user-friendly and that it speaks Google’s language. For instance, a website needs active content to even rank in the first place.\r\n\r\nAn active blog is one such way to keep a website active. HubSpot found in 2016 that 1 in 10 blog posts are compounding, which means that organic search can increase their traffic over time. Even old posts can have a positive effect on website traffic as HubSpot found in 2014 that 75 percent of HubSpot’s total blog views and 90 percent of all blog leads come from old blog posts.\r\n\r\nBy posting blogs on a regular basis, even just once a month, medical professionals can bring in more traffic and send a message to Google that they are still active. Google will be more inclined to put an active website with ranking content than a website that does not. Doctor Genius can find the healthy balance to provide clients with a quality user-friendly website that will rank well online.\r\n\r\n<h3>Regular posts bring in more patients</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-18-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-639\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-18-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-18-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-18-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p>In 2016, HubSpot stated that content consumption for the past two years on Facebook had increased by 57 percent.</p></div>\r\n\r\nAny patient who sees a Facebook page that only posts once every few months will be less-inclined to follow that page. HubSpot found in 2017 that 74 percent of people use Facebook for professional reasons, such as to advertise a practice. Thus, it is important for professional medical practices to keep up regular posts. However, the wrong type of content may not have much of an impact or even have a negative impact.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, with a team of personnel onsite, we post content that will help generate more likes and bring in new followers. By keeping up active Facebook and blog posts, we can help our clients build up a larger patient base and actually retain patients for years to come. We understand how Google ranks web content and will take the necessary steps to enhance our clients’ online presence. Give us a call and take the first step toward enhancing your website today.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
