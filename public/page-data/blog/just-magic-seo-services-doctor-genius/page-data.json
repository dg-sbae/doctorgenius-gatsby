When people hear a company or service mention Search Engine Optimization, SEO, many automatically assume that it is black magic or a hat full of cheap parlor tricks. At Doctor Genius, we have no ulterior motives or cheap tricks hidden up our sleeves. With the proper SEO services backing up a practice, the owner of the practice will experience an increase of influence and reach in the digital landscape.\r\n<h3>The need to know about SEO</h3>\r\nOne main tip that can help clients understand SEO is that there is no shortcut to success. Any SEO service that states a website only needs more keywords to reach a larger audience or to purchase more links is not truly going to help the company’s website. Google recently posted a video on the subject of hiring an SEO company, presented by Developer Programs Tech Lead, Maile Ohye.\r\n\r\nOhye covers several key factors that people need to search for when considering investing in SEO services. The truth is that an SEO company can only do so much with any given website.  “An SEO’s potential is only as high as the quality of your business or website,” Ohye states. Ohye also highlights the fact that an SEO company “Looks to improve the entire searcher experience” from “search results to clicking on your website and potentially converting.” A few services that can help clients achieve this through the use of SEO services include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>A mobile-friendly website</li>\r\n \t<li>Good navigation</li>\r\n \t<li>Tools to build a great brand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt takes time for an SEO company, such as Doctor Genius, to develop or enhance a website and lead to a positive increase in the client’s practice. In fact, as Ohye states, SEO companies need “four months to a year to help your business first implement improvements and then see potential benefits.” Another key component for any company to consider when investing in SEO is that the entire company needs to be committed to the SEO improvements.\r\n<h5><em>“An SEO’s potential is only as high as the quality of your business or website,” –Maile Ohye</em></h5>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/piSvFxV_M04\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<h3>Put in the effort to watch a company grow</h3>\r\nWith a multitude of methods for improving a company’s online presence through SEO, there are also factors to get the best use out of SEO. Other tips for possible clients who are wary of investing in SEO services that Ohye states include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Conducting a two-way interview between the SEO company and the client</li>\r\n \t<li>Being prepared to answer some questions about one’s business that the SEO company may ask</li>\r\n \t<li>Being prepared to receive feedback from an audit on the company and the rates for improving specific areas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we build clients a new website and cover many more aspects than simply placing keywords in the right places. As Ohye states in her video, one of our main goals is to help clients identify their target patient demographic and track how those patients search specific terms online. We use honest methods to help our clients rank online with quality content.

While it is great when a practice brings in new patients, it is even better when the new patient decides to continue visiting the practice for health needs. Dentists can retain patients and build lasting patient relationships through specific techniques in the digital market. Fortunately, Burkhart Dental is hosting an event with speakers from our team at Doctor Genius and Nickerson Consulting.\r\n<h3>What you need to know</h3>\r\nTitled, “Are You Retaining New Patients in Your Practice?” This event takes place on Friday, March 17, 2017, at the Marriot Residence Inn 38305 Cook Street, Palm Desert, CA 92211. The event will be from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and will open registration at 8:30 a.m. for attendees. The conference will begin with a continental breakfast before our speakers take the stage to present.\r\n\r\nThe speakers will answer questions that many medical professionals in the field ask and struggle with on a regular basis. These questions include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>How do you determine a true active patient base?</li>\r\n \t<li>How do you determine new patients in your practice?</li>\r\n \t<li>How do you look at retention with new patients?</li>\r\n \t<li>How do you determine growth from these key indicators?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRetaining patients can be difficult for a practice of any medical background. While there are a variety of possible techniques for retaining patients and building a consistent amount of patients, not all techniques will be the most effective. This event will help to offer insight into which techniques are more effective in helping with patient retention.\r\n<h3>Guest speakers</h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-386\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h5><strong>“Are You Retaining New Patients in Your Practice?” This event takes place on Friday, March 17, 2017, at the Marriot Residence Inn 38305 Cook Street, Palm Desert, CA 92211.</strong></h5>\r\nThere are three main speakers at the event, two of which are speakers from the Doctor Genius team.

Lately, it seems that many businesses rely on discounts and specials to bring in more consumers. Many private practices charge fair and average rates already, making discounts unnecessary. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help a private practice establish trust with patients without relying on constant deals or discounts.\r\n<h3>Consistency online and in the office</h3>\r\nWhile there is nothing wrong with a private practice offering discounts or specials on specific procedures, no effective business model can offer them consistently. Offering too many deals on a regular basis can increase costs and lead to financial difficulties in the future. Establishing trust with patients will require more than discounts. The patient needs to feel that this practice will treat his or her health issue efficiently and at a fair cost. BizReport states that 76 percent of consumers view customer service as a test of how much the company values them.\r\n\r\nHaving a website can be extremely beneficial for a private practice, granting current and future patients access to information about the practice and services provided. Regardless of what the website states, if the patient finds out that the practice does not offer that specific service or does not follow through on the web content, then the patient is more likely to leave the practice. In order for patients to trust a private practice, they need to find consistent information on the website that matches the core values of the practice.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with the client to provide quality content for the specific practice and the services it provides. We can help to target what patients look for in a website for a private practice and incorporate it onto the web pages. With consistency, the patient should not feel cheated when arriving at the practice.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-353\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>Keep an active online presence through website and social media platforms</h3>\r\nA private practice can have a website and social media platform, but not rank high in Google search results. This means that no one will be able to find the private practice’s website online unless they type in the precise name of the practice. In other cases, a private practice will have a website but not update any blogs or posts on a social media page. Thus, the client finds a website that does not have an active post from within the current year.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, a website without reviews from the last year will also push patients away from the website. A lack of updated content can make a patient feel the practice is also outdated or not on top of things, motivating the patient to look elsewhere.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><em>&#8220;&#8230;76 percent of consumers view customer service as a test of how much the company values them.&#8221;</em></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we can keep up regular blog postings to a website and keep up regular social media posts as well. We understand that it can be difficult for a private practice to balance taking care of patients along with keeping up an effective online presence in the digital landscape. We maintain active content circulating on a website to help keep the website current.
