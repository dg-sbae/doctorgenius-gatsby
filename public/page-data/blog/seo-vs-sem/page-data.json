These terms cover different aspects of using search engines to gain visibility online and guide patients to your website, where they hopefully make the choice to learn more about your services. As you analyze your office’s goals, knowing how to use SEO and SEM can help you <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/10/22/how-to-get-a-higher-roi-on-your-marketing-campaigns/#7c482c747501\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/10/22/how-to-get-a-higher-roi-on-your-marketing-campaigns/#7c482c747501\">increase your return</a> and use your money and time effectively.  </p>\r\n<h2>The difference between SEO and SEM</h2>\r\n<p>Before you can use SEO and SEM successfully, you must first understand the differences between the two.</p>\r\n<h3>What is SEO?</h3>\r\n<p>SEO stands for search engine optimization, which is the process of increasing traffic to your website and focusing on your target audience by ranking high on search engines when someone searches for a word or phrase related to your line of work. While it is common for businesses to pay for someone to handle the SEO of a website, this method relies entirely on free, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\">organic strategies</a>. There are several essential components that affect how well a site is optimized for search engines:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keyword optimization: </strong>Choosing the right keywords and phrases and utilizing them effectively is the most important part of on-page SEO. This involves performing keyword research, considering placement of words, and creating content.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Backlinking:</strong> One way to efficiently boost your site’s reputation is by including backlinks to other trustworthy sources throughout your content. You should also manage any other sites that link to your page and consider disavowing any questionable sources.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Crawlability: </strong>A high-functioning backend is also important for SEO. Having a site map, ensuring the server is secure, and hosting pages that load quickly all contribute to the technical crawlability of the site.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>What is SEM?</h3>\r\n<p>Rather than rely on organic content to boost your office’s website, you can also include search engine marketing in your strategy. This practice uses paid advertisements to make a site more visible on search engines.</p>\r\n<p>SEM often refers to paid-per-click advertising, which means you are only charged for the ad if the patient clicks on it. However, like SEO, keyword research is essential for ensuring a large number of high-quality leads encounter the ad.</p>\r\n<h2>How to utilize both SEO in and SEM in a campaign</h2>\r\n<p>Most marketing campaigns benefit from using a combination of SEO and SEM. Knowing how much to use of each depends on your budget, current goals, industry, and website performance.</p>\r\n<p>For new offices with the primary goal of gaining brand awareness and visibility, SEM offers immediate results. Even if the website is not optimized, it can still gain visibility while you finetune those details. If keywords are very competitive for your industry, PPC ads make it easier to appear on the search engine ranking page than it would with SEO.</p>\r\n<p>However, SEO offers long-lasting results that are not limited by a temporary ad. For well-established brands with quality organic content and a strong website, improving SEO has notable benefits.</p>\r\n<h2>Take your marketing efforts to the next level</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand how SEM and SEO work together to make a marketing campaign successful.

The primary goal of your website is not only to get people to see it but also to get them to choose your clinic over others. Converting those views into clients takes a little more effort in this ultra-competitive business. Walking through a conversion funnel allow you to see how page views become in-person appointments by following a user&#8217;s path from website visits through conversion. Take a closer look at how content marketing can help drive traffic through the proper funnels and straight to your front door.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding the stages of the funnel</h2>\r\n<p>The term conversion funnel describes the way people go from browsing the web to becoming your clients. It maps out the path people take from curiosity to appointments to improve your website&#8217;s chances of conversions in the future. There are three basic stages to a funnel:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> This is the first interaction a potential client has with your practice. It often occurs when your website is returned as a search result to a person looking up a medical term or condition.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> At this point, the user is doing some serious perusing on your practice&#8217;s site. Blog posts created to capture the greatest interest are effective ways to pull clients from the awareness stage down into the evaluation or middle funnel. Users who spend quality time in this step are genuinely interested in the services your practice provides.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Your ultimate goal is to get this window-shopper to pick up the phone or click a link to book an appointment. Getting users to drop down into this sector takes know-how of creating content and fine-tuning search analytics to answer relevant questions and earn a certain measure of authority and respect. When a client converts, it is because something about what you presented gained a measure of trust. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Using Google Analytics to transition visitors to clients</h2>\r\n<p>To create a website that maximizes the conversion funnel, it is imperative to track a client&#8217;s journey through your page so you can fine-tune for the kind of content that leads to a higher conversion rate. Using Google Analytics can give you a better understanding of your webpage&#8217;s visitors and how they interact with your content. Breaking down the information can help you refine the way traffic is driven to and through your page.</p>\r\n<h3>Who views your page?</h3>\r\n<p>The Google Analytics page provides a wealth of insight into the type of traffic your website gets. Familiarize yourself with the users who visit your website, or rather, the data associated with them. When people conduct online searches, their IP address is recorded in Google. That address allows Google to track their activity online, including any visits to your website. Google Analytics can generate a report telling you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The average times the same IP address has visited your site</li>\r\n\t<li>The amount of time the user spends engaged with your content</li>\r\n\t<li>The pages visited on your site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Understanding this information can allow you to see if the content you create correlates to repeat visits from users. By tracking user engagement, you can see how many visitors convert to in-house appointments.</p>\r\n<h3>What content gets the most traffic?</h3>\r\n<p>In the past, healthcare practices relied solely on word of mouth to gain new clients. This most often came in the form of friends or family recommending a practice to someone new. However, the internet not only allows clients to find their own providers but also allows you the opportunity to attract people you would not have gotten otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>The content you create can make or break your ability to funnel new users into becoming clients. By analyzing the page hits and time spent on your site, you can make changes to not only the way you present information, but the type of information visitors to your website are most interested in seeing. You may see a pattern emerge that takes your practice&#8217;s web presence in a different direction. For example, if you focus mostly on product awareness but see that users to your site tend to spend the most time reading about signs and symptoms of conditions, then you may want to create more content centered around this.</p>\r\n<h3>What is the bounce rate?</h3>\r\n<p>Your practice&#8217;s website probably has multiple layers and pages to offer the greatest chance that users would remain on a page and eventually schedule an appointment. When looking at Google Analytics, you may notice something called the bounce rate. As explained by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/10/30/seven-google-analytics-metrics-you-need-to-track-to-grow-your-business/#1c66e6fb6180\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/10/30/seven-google-analytics-metrics-you-need-to-track-to-grow-your-business/#1c66e6fb6180\">Forbes.com</a>, this number indicates how often someone opened a single page on your website and then left.</p>\r\n<p>There is no further data available to track these users because they failed to engage with your webpage beyond that single hit. This may be someone who followed a Google search result, such as a featured snippet, to your page, and then closed it without going any further through. A fairly high bounce rate is not necessarily a bad thing unless you notice that certain pages seem to encourage users to leave your site.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, if your homepage gets a high number of quick visits, then there is likely something that is either broken (like a link) or not engaging enough to warrant a user&#8217;s time to investigate further. Consider making your homepage more inviting and personal. Sometimes all it can take to retain a user is to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\">add photos of your office</a> and staff at work. Sometime specific articles may have higher bounce rates, either because the subject matter is not popular or perhaps the content is confusingly presented. A bounce rate analysis can help you figure out what needs fixing to retain users on your page.</p>\r\n<h2>We can provide solutions</h2>\r\n<p>If all of this talk about conversion funnels and bounce rates has your head spinning, never fear!

When that person leaves without exploring the site past the page originally clicked on, this is called a bounce. The bounce rate is calculated based on the number of people who exit your webpage before clicking on any of your other pages. The more people who leave prematurely, the higher your website’s bounce rate is.</p>\r\n<p>Higher bounce rates are bad for business because they mean fewer visitors are converting. Converting can involve completing any number of actions, such as sending a digital message, filling out the newsletter signup form, or buying a product. By decreasing bounce rate, you can increase your audience and business.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to reduce bounce rate</h2>\r\n<p>A great bounce rate is around 30-50%, while a poor bounce rate can land above 80%. You can view your overall bounce rate and the bounce rate of specific pages on Google Analytics or another <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close\">analytic alternative</a>. Identifying which pages have the highest rate on your website can give you a specific area to focus on instead of trying to rework the content design and SEO strategy of your entire site at once. Here are changes you can make to a page to decrease bounce rate.</p>\r\n<h3>Make content easier to read</h3>\r\n<p>Large blocks of text are much harder to digest than text that is broken up and formatted to please the eye. Using subheadings, bullet points, images, charts, and occasional bolded keywords can make it easier for people to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">scan your content</a> and find links to other pages. If you have various types of pages (blogs, articles, contact pages, etc.), create style guides for each that make sure all posts adhere to the right format and are easier to read.  </p>\r\n<h3>Employ strong calls to action</h3>\r\n<p>Experiment with calls to action to see what attracts readers to click on services you offer and engage more with your site. Some may stand stronger above the rest, and you may find that others do not receive as much attention. By establishing a powerful call to action, you entice visitors to sign up for newsletters and explore more parts of your site.</p>\r\n<h3>Improve usability</h3>\r\n<p>Your site should be appealing from the first second a visitor lands on it. Anything that looks clunky, jarring, or confusing is likely to lose newcomers quickly, and in an age when online attention spans last mere seconds, creating a captivating hook is essential. Double-check that your site is easy to navigate and that finding information is not a hassle. Your site should also be able to translate smoothly from any device and screen size. A majority of users browse the internet on a mobile device, so the last thing you want is a site that looks terrible on a small screen.</p>\r\n<h2>Reach out for more great ideas</h2>\r\n<p>Every website is different, and the creation of user-friendly, attractive pages should be tailored to individual business needs. Discover new ways to improve your site’s aesthetic and minimize bounce rate, and <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">contact us</a> to see how to change your site to fit the latest marketing trends.   </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
