This group of representatives will allow more insight from your team about what they think about the company&#8217;s culture. Implementing an engagement committee can help take the guesswork out of employee satisfaction and provide valuable information about improving your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Improving Employee Satisfaction and Productivity</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/06/22/employee-engagement-what-and-why/?sh=2bb31807f372\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/06/22/employee-engagement-what-and-why/?sh=2bb31807f372\">Forbes </a>defines employee engagement as the emotional commitment an employee has to an organization and its goals. Establishing this group can be an excellent way to improve communication between leadership and the rest of the staff while increasing the commitment employees have to their workplace. Engagement committees help promote a healthy working environment by facilitating networking and exchanging ideas to improve employee satisfaction and productivity.</p>\r\n<h3>Giving Everyone a Voice</h3>\r\n<p>Most practices have employees who do excellent work behind the scenes but are not necessarily involved in decision-making processes. It can be easy for ideas from this demographic to go unheard. These employees are important because they are often the ones that can point out better processes, improve patient relations, or cut costs. Voicing opinions also allows employees to build intrinsic motivators and create a sense of trust and belonging. Engagement committees give these employees a way to suggest ideas and help make the business better.</p>\r\n<h3>Understanding Employees</h3>\r\n<p>Perhaps employees feel uncomfortable approaching the leadership with questions or concerns. Or they may be concerned about maintaining an appropriate work-life balance. While it is possible to get some insight from employee surveys, an engagement committee can provide more context and understanding to the way employees feel and think. Knowing the reasons behind such employee sentiment is also essential to creating any positive change within the workplace.</p>\r\n<h3>Address Employee Concerns</h3>\r\n<p>In many cases, employees leave a job without providing the real reason they were unhappy. Having an engagement committee can reveal the source of the problem and allow the company to address it quickly. Taking action can prevent the employee from leaving and help prevent other employees from quitting for the same reason. </p>\r\n<h3>Bring Unknown Issues to Light</h3>\r\n<p>Lower-level employees frequently have concerns that go unvoiced. When these concerns go unaddressed, operations are less productive than they could be, and employee morale is lower than it should be.

HR can help practices stay in tune with employees and determine what benefits they care about the most. Creating this type of working environment not only attracts quality talent but also encourages employee loyalty.</p>\r\n<h3>Create an Employee Handbook</h3>\r\n<p>An employee handbook is a valuable resource for employer and employee communication. While an employee handbook can help in a dispute, it is also an excellent way to define employee expectations and specify job descriptions clearly. Make sure to update the handbook as the practice grows or processes and procedures change.</p>\r\n<h3>Payroll</h3>\r\n<p>Double-check payment amounts before finalizing employee paychecks, especially when using an automated payroll program. Paying employees correctly and on time is one of the easiest ways to earn their trust, and failing to do so is one of the fastest ways to lose it. Setting and sticking to a payment schedule and remaining compliant with how employees are classified can be critical steps to avoiding payroll issues. </p>\r\n<h3>Taxation</h3>\r\n<p>Practices should also be aware of which taxes they need to report and deposit. A few types of taxes to be aware of are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Federal income tax</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Federal unemployment</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Medicare taxes</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Social security </p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Employers and employees share the responsibility for making sure to report taxes properly. </p>\r\n<h3>Management Services</h3>\r\n<p>Managing employees can be one of the most challenging HR tasks. Proper processes for handling situations like employee termination and workers&#8217; comp claims are essential. Having clear plans in place for these events will allow practices to manage them professionally and legally.</p>\r\n<h2>Contact Us for More Information</h2>\r\n<p>Although human resources may seem challenging for a small practice, there are ways to make it easier to manage.
