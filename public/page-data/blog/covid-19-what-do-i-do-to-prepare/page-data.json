You may be asking yourself what you should do to prepare for COVID-19. There are many things to consider in the wake of a pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Having a plan in place may assuage any anxieties you have about contracting the virus and protecting yourself from it.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider Your Household</h3>\r\n<p>All household members should consult with each other to determine what will be done if there is an outbreak in the community. Some populations are more at risk for suffering complications from coronavirus than others. According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/get-your-household-ready-for-COVID-19.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), vulnerable groups include older adults and those with chronic health problems.</p>\r\n<p>If you or a loved one falls into one of these categories, please consult with a healthcare professional for guidelines one how to reduce the chances of infection.</p>\r\n<h3>Food to Stock Up On</h3>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/pandemic\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Homeland Security</a>, individuals should store a two-week supply of water and food before a pandemic strikes. Individuals can shop for the same foods they normally would, provided they are nutritious and do not have a short shelf-life. Frozen fruits and vegetables are best, as are nutritious non-perishables.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that there is an adequate supply of any needed prescription drugs. Try to get a 30-day supply, if possible. Other health supplies (like nonprescription drugs, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins) should also be sufficiently stocked.</p>\r\n<img src=\"/blogimg/how-to-prepare-for-corvid-inline.jpg\" alt=\"How should I prepare for the Coronavirus?\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Supplies You Need</h3>\r\n<p>Though it is essential to stock up on needed supplies in case of emergency, individuals should also keep in mind that hoarding is not the answer. Across the globe, some stores have been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/health/toilet-paper-shortages-novel-coronavirus-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">undergoing a notorious shortage of toilet paper</a> due to the coronavirus crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s recommendation is that people have enough supplies to last them for two weeks at home. Prioritize basic toiletries and cleaning supplies, along with any needed supplies for children or pets. &#8220;Panic buying&#8221; may lead to a shortage of supplies for others, thus increasing a community&#8217;s overall vulnerability.</p>\r\n<h3>The Real Threat of COVID-19</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Still, the organization is optimistic that the virus can be &#8220;suppressed and controlled&#8221; with the proper planning and investment of resources. We do not yet know how severe the illness can be.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/health-information/coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">National Institutes of Health</a> states that &#8220;For the majority of people, the immediate risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low.&#8221;</a></p>\r\n<p>Taking the right preventive measures and having a plan in place, however, may help lessen any personal impact.</p>\r\n<h3>Preparation Can Be Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>Just hearing the word &#8220;pandemic&#8221; can be intimidating. Planning for a potential quarantine can be a proactive way to lessen any feelings of fear and lessen your chances of contracting the disease. It is important to remember that one individual&#8217;s actions may help protect an entire community.</p>\r\n<p>Taking preventive measures may also help you feel less stressed about potentially catching coronavirus.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Many Americans are unsure how coronavirus&#8217; new designation as a pandemic will affect the way they conduct business. It is important to know what to expect and have a plan in place in case you are placed on lockdown. You should also know what to do if you need to work from home.</p>\r\n<h3>Understanding Lockdowns</h3>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/global/emergency-lockdown\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</a> (NIH), lockdown procedures are necessary when an immediate threat presents itself to building occupants. During these instances, it becomes more dangerous for occupants to leave the building than it is for them to stay in secured areas. With the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens may be placed under lockdown if disease-causing contaminants have been released into the environment.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21172390/italy-lockdown-coronavirus-expansion-lombardy\" target=\"_blank\">entire country of Italy is on lockdown</a> to prevent further spread of coronavirus. Consequently, Italian citizens are not allowed to assemble in public or do anything other than stay at home.</p>\r\n<h3>Lockdown Response Activities</h3>\r\n<p>The number one thing to do during a lockdown is to stay calm, as panicking will only make things worse. If placed under lockdown, individuals should secure themselves at home as soon as possible. They should not leave until directed otherwise by emergency personnel, as doing so will increase the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Follow any directions given by the relevant authorities until and after being given the all-clear.</p>\r\n<h3>Taking Your Practice Remote</h3>\r\n<p>Many business owners may want to take their practice remote in anticipation of a lockdown. Doing so seamlessly involves time and planning. According to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90475330/8-strategies-to-set-up-remote-work-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">a CEO writing for Fast Company</a>, it all &#8220;starts from the top.&#8221; In other words, business owners should lead by example, making themselves present and available on various online tools and channels.</p>\r\n<p>Since there is less non-verbal communication involved in remote work, it is crucial to reinforce the company&#8217;s missions and expectations. At the same time, creating and promoting a digital company culture is critical. To do so, business owners must choose the right tools (such as Slack or Google Hangouts) and keep them in constant use.</p>\r\n<p>Following the example of The United States Office of Personnel Management brought up in an article by The Washington Post, another option is to “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-now-wants-hundreds-of-thousands-of-federal-workers-to-be-ready-to-telework-to-limit-coronavirus-spread/2020/03/10/ea284a12-620b-11ea-b3fc-7841686c5c57_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">issue ­laptops and grant access to computer networks.</a>&#8220;</p>\r\n<h3>Remote Work Strategies for Employees</h3>\r\n<p>Of course, employees should also be aware of the new expectations they will be accountable for while working in a remote work environment. Try to prepare for working from home as soon as possible. This involves taking note of any software, information, bookmarks, phone numbers, and anything else that might be necessary to carry out essential job duties.</p>\r\n<p>Next, set up a designated, separate workspace at home, if possible. Many workers find this helps them strike an appropriate work-life balance. It is crucial to communicate as clearly as possible.</p>\r\n<p>Workers should set up a culture of responsiveness and keep colleagues updated on any deadlines or progress they have made throughout the day. Additionally, those who need to take care of pets or children should be transparent about their schedule.\r\n\r\n<h3>Work Goes On</h3>\r\n<p>With proper planning, you can ensure that your business has a seamless transition into working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can lessen your chances of contracting the coronavirus by taking preventive measures and being prepared for a lockdown. Though feelings of fear and anxiety are natural, it is crucial to stay calm.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

The question is no longer &#8220;will it hit your neighborhood.&#8221; Now, you should be asking &#8220;by when.&#8221; Like many others, you would probably like to know what to do when handling day-to-day situations to avoid infection. </p>\r\n<p>Among an onslaught of questions we hear, one that appears often is whether it is safe to even go outside. Here are a few tips other medical professionals are offering in regard to this question.</p>\r\n<h3>Preventing the Illness</h3>\r\n<p>It is important to note that during an outbreak of COVID-19, the main focus of a lockdown is to slow the spread of it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, states that <a href= \"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html\" target=\" _blank\">COVID-19 is spread</a> &#8220;Between people who are in close contact with one another,&#8221; and &#8220;Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&#8221;\r\nThe CDC adds that many places where a large number of people gather may shut down during a lockdown. This can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Community centers</li>\r\n<li>Schools</li>\r\n<li>Offices or places of work</li>\r\n<li>Movie theaters</li>\r\n<li>Large events/gatherings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img src=\"/blogimg/exercise-caution-corvid-inline.jpg\" alt=\"Be careful in large crowds or parks\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1987\" />\r\n\r\n<p>So, while going outside will not immediately mean a person contracts COVID-19, that does not mean that people should spend too much time outside. In fact, limiting one&#8217;s time outside can help decrease the risk of contracting COVID-19 from another person. Unless there is a national warning to remain indoors put into effect, people can go outside when absolutely necessary.</p>\r\n<h3>Steps to Take When Outside</h3>\r\n<p>Even though people are able to go outside, there are precautionary steps people can take to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p><b>Frequently Wash Hands with Soap and Water</b></p>\r\nThe <a href= \"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html\" target=\" _blank\">United States Department of Labor</a> and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration gives details on controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the office space. The Department of Labor states that regardless of specific exposure risks, it is crucial to &#8220;Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>This advice not only applies to employees in the workspace but to people of all ages in any setting. It is crucial to wash the hands and decrease the risk of contracting the condition.</p>\r\n<p><b>Avoid sharing food or drinks</b></p>\r\n<p>Whether someone is going out for a meal or with friends, do not share food or drinks. The CDC states that &#8220;Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms.&#8221; People who do not display signs of COVID-19 can still be contagious. Avoid sharing food and drinks to decrease the chance of spreading it.</p>\r\n<p><b>Clean surfaces when in public</b></p>\r\n<p>Before using a surface, such as a table at a restaurant or bench at a park, it is crucial to keep the surfaces clean. Ensure the surface was wiped down before using it to prevent the risk of interacting with germs and potential areas that are contaminated with the virus.</p>\r\n<p><b>Avoid large community events and gatherings</b></p>\r\n<p>In many cases of a virus such as COVID-19 spreading, public gatherings and events may close down. Schools may close to prevent the risk of the virus spreading through children. Community centers, churches, movie theaters, and more may temporarily close. In the cases of colleges closing, some may have students work from home.</p>\r\n<p>Place of employment may do the same thing, choosing to have employees complete work remotely and not come into the office.</p>\r\n<h3>Seek the Information You Need</h3>\r\n<p>When it comes to your health, it is crucial to seek information from a credible source. If you have any concerns about COVID-19, reach out to your medical professional for more information. While outside, exercise caution in interaction with other people and limit the amount of time you spend outside. It is important to note that protocol for dealing with COVID-19 and going outside may change in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Review credible online sources and news stations for current updates. If you believe that you or a loved one has symptoms, contact your medical provider for instructions on treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
