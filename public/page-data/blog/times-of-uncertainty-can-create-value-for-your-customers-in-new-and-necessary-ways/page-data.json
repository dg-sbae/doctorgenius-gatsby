Uncertainty hangs in the air as the stock market takes<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/times-of-uncertainty-can-create-value-for-your-customers-in-new-and-necessary-ways/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the entire world into a crisis. Uncertainty hangs in the air as the stock market takes a plunge, oil prices go into free fall, and several businesses panic, not knowing what to expect. The fact is, uncertainty is a constant element. It is always there, and like the weather, it is out of people&#8217;s control.</p>\r\n<p>At this stage, businesses have two options to either get swept up by the uncertainties or take charge and innovate to create value for their customers in new and important ways.</p>\r\n<h2>Handling Uncertain Times as a Business Owner</h2>\r\n<p>During uncertain times, leaders are bound to make reflexive decisions such as halting hiring, reducing investments, cutting marketing and brand investments, and even ceasing decisions completely. These defensive measures are entirely reasonable and may even be necessary for survival in these uncertain times.</p>\r\n<p>However, they could be counterproductive in the short and long term. Such decisions could also put companies at a disadvantage in the aftermath of the crisis when situations improve.</p>\r\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\r\n<p>An effective solution is to adopt the right approach and mindset. Instead of reacting instinctively to the news and situation resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, businesses can act quickly and proactively to change their path and follow another. This path can include focusing on new and innovative ways to add value to their customers. Ultimately, when it comes to value, prospective customers are the ones who can determine what counts as value and what does not.</p>\r\n<p>To create value, business owners need to understand how their customers define value and how they can meet those demands. This means understanding how the current situation is affecting them and thinking innovatively. Customers often have major considerations about value, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cost impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Revenue impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Risk impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Value impact</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Cost impact</b></p>\r\n<p>Customers want to cut down on unnecessary expenses. When developing new solutions, business owners need to consider how much money their customers will save by recognizing and adopting the change over the status quo.</p>\r\n<p><b>Revenue impact</b></p>\r\n<p>The value proposition should offer potential customers an opportunity to increase their revenue. They will be more willing to adopt changes if ignoring the new value offering means that they might miss out on potential revenue.</p>\r\n<p><b>Risk impact</b></p>\r\n<p>When thinking of new ways to deliver value, business owners should look for ways to mitigate or eliminate risk factors that customers may face with the current products or services.</p>\r\n<p><b>Value impact</b></p>\r\n<p>New values should help customers achieve their goals faster and more reliably. This also means allowing customers to realize the impact of adopting new values on functional, corporate, and personal goals.</p>\r\n<h2>Stay Informed</h2>\r\n<p>Business owners need to understand what drives the value determination of their customers and key stakeholders. This also means assessing and exposing the costs, limitations, and risks associated with their present situation. It demands carefully aligning with the most critical aspects of the purpose, approach, and capabilities of the business with the things that matter or are valuable to the customers. With the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, now is the time to get innovative and create new and necessary value.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Schools and businesses have<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/silver-lining-during-this-time-time-with-family-and-time-to-take-time-off/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Most employers and employees feel stressed about COVID-19. This goes beyond the fear of getting sick. Schools and businesses have temporarily shut their doors, and shelter-in-place orders are in effect in most states. Life seemed to change overnight, and it is hard to process. There is a silver lining in this, though. You can take the time to spend with your family.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of family time during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>American families spend an average of 37 minutes of quality time with each other a day, according to a study by Visit Anaheim. Long hours at work, school schedules, and catching up on chores are the main reasons that families cannot spend more time together. Now, however, families are spending hours together each day, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of togetherness. Lear the biggest benefits of spending time together during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<h3>Boost academic performance</h3>\r\n<p>Children who spend ample quality time with parents tend to perform better in school. During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents have become teachers. Parents work alongside their children, helping them complete schoolwork. Many mothers and fathers also use this time to play educational games and impart wisdom to the kids.</p>\r\n<p>When children go back to school after the pandemic, many will be in a better place academically.</p>\r\n<h3>Improve communication skills</h3>\r\n<p>When parents spend most of the time at work or doing chores, it is impossible to model ideal behavior to the kids. Now, with parents at home, they can help children learn communication skills. Acting as models, parents show children the proper way to communicate and behave. Many parents are using the coronavirus pandemic to help children grow into well-adjusted adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Create positive memories</h3>\r\n<p>Positive memories have a lasting impact on people’s well-being. People reach for positive memories during stressful times. These memories remind them that navigating obstacles is possible. Researchers have discovered that children who form positive memories with parents are more tolerant and have better cognitive skills. This also helps with mental health and well-being. As a bonus, those memories are there long after the parents are gone.</p>\r\n<h3>Build stronger mentoring skills</h3>\r\n<p>Adults who spend quality time with family members build stronger mentoring skills. These adults fine-tune these skills while promoting good behavior during family time, and the skills carry over into the workplace. Business owners and employees benefit from developing mentoring skills. After developing the skills, employees and employers can perform better at work. These skills also help people improve the performance of others as well.</p>\r\n<h2>Getting the most out of family time</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 crisis is an uncertain time but use it as a way to bond with your family. Talk frankly about the pandemic with kids and spouse, but do not dwell on the negative. Remember that this is a great time to bond with the people you love the most. Embrace this newfound family time while it is here. Before long, life will return to normal, and you will look back at this time and appreciate the memories you created.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Some of the changes are<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic maintaining an ongoing status, consumer behavior seems to have changed overnight. Some of the changes are only temporary. However, others might become permanent. Businesses must adapt to these changes to serve consumers. Dental practices and businesses that adapt are likely to excel after the crisis.</p>\r\n<h2>Expected changes after the COVID-19 crisis</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a psychological change in consumers. Fear and anxiety drive people. Americans have concerns about products and businesses in ways never experienced before. The crisis has forced people to interact with businesses in new ways, as well.</p>\r\n<p>This crisis has changed customer preference. Many expect the psychological impact to last for the long term. By learning about the expected changes, practices can help to accommodate the needs of customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Technology-enabled solutions are the new normal</h3>\r\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has made consumers turn to technology more to meet their needs. Consumers use technology to shop for groceries, order food, stay connected with people, and more. With the pandemic, patients are now relying on technology to remain in contact with medical professionals, financial situations, and more.</p>\r\n<p>Many people tried online services for the first time during the pandemic. Consumers are likely to continue using technology to aid in everyday tasks. This could create an increase in curbside pickup and grocery delivery, for example. Due to this, it is crucial for medical professionals to utilize online systems.</p>\r\n<h3>Demand for product transparency</h3>\r\n<p>Health and safety will remain a top priority after the pandemic is under control. This will cause more consumers to demand transparency before choosing products. In the past, consumers often believed what companies told them about products. The pandemic has forever changed that. One reason for that is what consumers discovered about hand sanitizer during the outbreak.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html\">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, explains the effects of hand sanitizer on COVID-19. Many consumers relied on hand sanitizer to fight the coronavirus. Then, people found out that products with less than 60% alcohol are not effective. Consumers realized they need to research products to ensure they are effective. Otherwise, products might not deliver on a company’s promise.</p>\r\n<p>Health and safety demands will continue. Consumers will need more transparency from companies. That includes research that proves that products work. Companies that cannot provide this information might have trouble generating revenue.</p>\r\n<h3>An increase in preventive medicine</h3>\r\n<p>The emphasis on health and safety will go beyond consumer-buying habits. Consumers are also expected to make preventive care a priority after the crisis is over. This priority branches to doctor and dental visits that help them stay healthy. Some people skip their annual exams. That is expected to be rare in the coming years, though.</p>\r\n<p>Consumers might not see doctors and dentists the traditional way. The coronavirus crisis has created a boom for telemedicine and teledentistry. Many expect it to continue well after the virus is under control. Many dentists, physicians, and consumers appreciate the ease of telemedicine and teledentistry. It makes it easier to monitor patients and provides consultations.</p>\r\n<h2>Embrace the changing landscape after COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 will have a lasting impact on consumers and the businesses that serve them. Americans understand that life can change on a dime. People are more involved in the products they buy and the care they receive. Businesses, including dental and medical practices, must make changes to meet these demands. Those that do so will meet the needs of consumers and might even enjoy an increase in revenue in the coming year.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
