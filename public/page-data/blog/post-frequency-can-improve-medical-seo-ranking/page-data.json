Posting new content to your site regularly is a fantastic way to keep current patients interested in your material and up to date on your business. It is also one of the most effective ways to generate a better SEO ranking in search engines like Google. Why does this matter? A majority of potential patients are likely to search for your medical services in a search engine, and they can find you considerably easier if your site ranks higher in SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>Fresh healthcare content and SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Search engine optimization has become a key part of every successful website today. Organic searches (keywords that people type into a search engine to find a relative website) usually make up half of total site traffic and often result in more paying patients than sites that rely heavily on traditional ad campaigns. To create a website that gets clicked on after a search on Google, your site needs to be one of the top results on the first page. You can achieve this goal by posting frequently and updating your medical SEO content.</p>\r\n<h3>Posting brand-new content</h3>\r\n<p>One of the simplest ways to boost your SEO rank is by posting new content. This is often easier said than done. Posting regularly requires dedication, time, and creativity, but it can pay off phenomenally in the long run. Websites with a blog have far more indexed pages than those that do not, and Google’s algorithm views these sites as having valuable, fresh information that deserve higher rankings, allowing them to reach more online users.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to how much you should post to fully optimize SEO, there is no single answer. Generally, being consistent with how often you post is more valuable than the actual number of times you do so. Even just blogging monthly can create a steady audience for your website. To truly discover what frequency works best, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-use-analytics-to-view-online-ranking/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-use-analytics-to-view-online-ranking/\">use tools like Google Analytics</a> to discover the right frequency and time of day to post to bring in the most new users.</p>\r\n<h3>Updating old content</h3>\r\n<p>Fortunately, constantly posting new content is not your only option to improve SEO. You can take advantage of old posts by revamping and revitalizing content. Most posts have a lifespan of two to three years, with some always staying on top because the material is consistently relevant. To get Google to give your old posts new, improved rankings, simply update them with new information and statistics.</p>\r\n<h2>Doctor Genius can help your SEO ranking</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we offer tier plans that provide the right services to improve your site’s SEO through regularly posted content.

Oftentimes, a single search creates millions of results, but a user is probably not going to look past the first page (or even past the first half of the first page). Whether or not your website appears in the top five slots of that page depends on its organic ranking. Your website’s chances of being found in a Google search go up with a better ranking, but how do you boost its performance?</p>\r\n<h2>Raising your doctor online ranking</h2>\r\n<p>There are many ways to increase a website’s ranking through refined online practice management techniques. First, check your website’s current organic ranking on Google and other search engines. This can give you a starting point, and keeping track of this information can tell you which of these four methods generate the greatest improvement in ranking.  </p>\r\n<h3>1. Identify relevant keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Keywords are a huge part of healthcare digital marketing today. These are a specific word or short phrase that a user types into a search engine. If Google sees that the same or similar keywords appear in your content, your website is more likely to rank higher in the search results. To find the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2020/09/21/15-proven-tips-for-building-an-effective-keyword-list/?sh=3bc38a4c5297\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2020/09/21/15-proven-tips-for-building-an-effective-keyword-list/?sh=3bc38a4c5297\">right keywords</a> for your content, try typing in some that are relevant to your field to see what content they already bring up. Use tools such as Google Trends to identify options.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Make your website easier to read</h3>\r\n<p>Formatting and readability can make a huge difference in how much time a user spends on a site. Websites that have difficult readability or that are formatted poorly are more likely to quickly lose users. The longer a person stays on your site, the better it is ranked. Check that every page is clean and neat and is not crowded with too much information. A majority of people access the internet on a phone, so your site also needs to be able to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/designing-a-site-for-mobile-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/designing-a-site-for-mobile-users/\">function perfectly on a mobile device</a> as well as a desktop.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Generate unique and descriptive page titles</h3>\r\n<p>Every page on your site needs to have a concise title and a short title tag that presents a snippet of the page’s content. Try to place a keyword in the title as close to the beginning as possible. Keep the title tag under 60 characters and include the primary keyword, the company&#8217;s name, and an alternative title to the page or article, which appear as the title readers see on search engines. </p>\r\n<h3>4. Create engaging content</h3>\r\n<p>In the end, it is the content on your website that will keep users there the longest. Content needs to be fresh, intriguing, and top quality. Blogging regularly is a great way to constantly keep users engaged and returning to your site. Generating content on a weekly or monthly basis allows you to put more keywords throughout your website and attract more people to your business.</p>\r\n<h2>Get help improving your ranking</h2>\r\n<p>Improving organic search ranking is an essential part of getting your practice off the ground. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> at Doctor Genius for more tips and methods on how to improve your site’s ranking.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 16800 Aston Street, Suite 270, Irvine, CA 92606, provides a range of services for practice success.

Twitter is ideal for reaching new patients, promoting information about your practice, and driving more traffic to your website.  </p>\r\n<h2>Tips for tweets</h2>\r\n<p>That said, tweeting out links to new blog posts on your website is not enough to bring in new traffic. Like all social media platforms, certain marketing strategies work better than others on this media giant. Here are five tips to get the most out of a business Twitter account.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Promote links directly in a tweet</h3>\r\n<p>Encouraging more Twitter users to explore your website begins by providing links to content in short tweets. Tweets that are concise and intriguing are more likely to attract interest than longer ones. Consider writing tweets that are less than 100 characters (though Twitter allows up to 280). Present a question, write a call to action, or include an engaging quote from the content you are promoting that makes users want to click on the link.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Place a link in your bio</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to tweets, you can include a link to a website in your Twitter bio. The bio appears at the top of your profile page, offering a quick opportunity to present who you are to new patients. Many businesses take advantage of the bio by pitching services and interests. In this area, you may also include a link to anywhere on your website. If you have an official landing page specifically for new patients, the bio is a great place to drop a link to it.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Include hashtags</h3>\r\n<p>Hashtags are a fantastic way to generate interest in your content and connect with other users who share similar interests. In short, hashtags are specific words or key phrases that are placed after a # within a tweet. To attract the right audience and establish <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/\">strong SEO</a>, either create special hashtags that apply to your practice or include hashtags that others are already using to link your content to a larger conversation.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Try facts and statistics</h3>\r\n<p>Of the most engaging content on Twitter, facts, studies, and statistics top the list. Including a sneak peek at a new study or mentioning an interesting fact in a tweet is a great way to get someone to click on a link.</p>\r\n<h3>5. Use plenty of pictures</h3>\r\n<p>To catch the attention of users who quickly scan through their Twitter feed, try including interesting pictures that are relevant to your content. Pictures can make users pause as they scroll. This increases the chance that they will engage with the tweet by reading the content and clicking on links.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more ways to engage with new patients</h2>\r\n<p>Discover more ways to reach new patients and expand your practice through Doctor Genius. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for help optimizing your Twitter and your other social media platforms and promoting business.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 16800 Aston Street, Suite 270, Irvine, CA 92606, provides a range of services for practice success.
