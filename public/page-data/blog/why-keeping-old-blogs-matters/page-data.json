Above all else, it informs potential customers and clients of the products and services you offer. An integral part of a business page is the blog. These posts should contain relevant content and utilize terms to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/\">increase SEO optimization</a> and E-A-T rankings among search engines that direct traffic to the site. Older blog posts may seem to do nothing but take up space; however, even outdated, keeping them may prove beneficial. Learn why your old content is still essential and what you can do to keep it relevant.</p>\r\n<h2>What purpose do old blog posts serve?</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertadams/2017/04/10/23-proven-ways-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website/#3ddda45e2654\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertadams/2017/04/10/23-proven-ways-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website/#3ddda45e2654\">Forbes</a>, company blogs are a way to reach a broader audience by posting information and articles relevant to the business. The more traffic posts get, the higher the site is ranked in search engine analytics, which boosts it in results. When people visit a business site, they like to see an established platform and history. A blog with a higher number of relevant and appropriate posts also lends credence to the business&#8217;s credibility. Thus, deleting older posts may not only detract from that but also inadvertently remove articles that continue to perform well.</p>\r\n<h2>How can you make old content relevant?</h2>\r\n<p>If a search of your blog brings up poor writing or posts that no longer apply, then you may consider deleting them. However, instead of doing that, and risking a decrease in traffic or credibility, there are things you can do to make them relevant again.</p>\r\n<h3>Use links</h3>\r\n<p>You already know that consistently creating new content helps site visitors to see that you are engaging and relevant. Make older posts productive again by linking them in your newer posts. If a former piece has stood the test of time and is accurate, relevant, and well-written, repost it. There is nothing wrong with recycling material to continue benefiting your business. You may also want to drop blog links in other content on your site. Doing so may garner more views for older posts.</p>\r\n<h3>Update content</h3>\r\n<p>Your older blogs may have some outdated information. There is nothing wrong with correcting things that are now irrelevant or incorrect. Fix company contact information if that has changed, but do it without deleting the old. If former customers search your previous address or phone number, you still want the traffic directed to your page. Also, leave relevant SEO terms in place as much as possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Promote your business wisely</h2>\r\n<p>The purpose of a company website is to capture potential clients.

Due to the new situation for many patients in your community, it is crucial to learn how to tap into that market and offer the healthy lifestyle your services can provide. Doctor Genius has partnered with Gary Kadi, CEO of NextLevel Practice, to help clients like yourself face uncertainty while reopening your practice with a focus to adjust for success.</p>\n<h4>Who is Gary Kadi?</h4>\n<p>CEO of NextLevel Practice, Gary Kadi is also an advocate, author, and documentarian. Kadi authored Million Dollar Dentistry, a book that promotes dentists building a healthy practice for healthy patients and healthy lives. Kadi has guided NextLevel Practice to create over 1.6 billion in increased collections, 50,000 more true vacation weeks, and over 6 million healthier patients with practices. Kadi strives to help dentists educate their patients, empower their teams, and improve their finances.</p>\n<h4>What is a Complete Health Practice?</h4>\n<p>Complete Health Dentistry is a philosophy that focuses on maintaining good oral health in order to improve your overall general health. When you see your Complete Health Dentist for one of your preventive dental checkups, you’re not only taking care of your mouth but also your body. They will not only clean your teeth but also check for the early warning signs of both periodontal disease, oral cancer, and more. You’d be surprised what your mouth can tell you about the health of your entire body!</p>\n<p>With this in mind, a practice that believes in and practices Complete Health Dentistry integrates all areas of dental medicine in order to bring harmony to the mouth and body. Complete Health Dentistry Services Include: </p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A clean and attractive smile</li>\n\t<li>Cavity detection and treatment</li>\n\t<li>Gum disease therapy to stop the spread of this bacterial infection</li>\n\t<li>Oral cancer screening</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How is Complete Health Dentistry Becoming the New Normal?</h4>\n<p>As Gary Kadi explains, there are four main areas of the new normal in dentistry, including:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Less time for traditional dentistry methods</li>\n\t<li>Increased expenses</li>\n\t<li>Patient scarcity</li>\n\t<li>A new focus on selling health on a website</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What is the purpose of the Complete Health Practice Plan?</h4>\n<p>The purpose of the Complete Health Practice Plan is to provide our clients with the framework for a thriving practice in a new world. Our framework is an extension to Gary Kadi’s NextLevel Practice coaching products and programs, who work to create a “Healthy Practice” to make patients healthier. The Practice Plan’s end goal is to improve the health of the patient, team, and practice by conveying the connection between oral health and overall health. The Complete Health Practice brings to light the areas of the body and conditions most prominently related to untreated oral health.</p>\n<p>This process involves reviewing the patient’s medical history for signs of issues such as diabetes, inflammation, or high blood pressure that can correlate to the treatment and prevention of oral health issues. The patient’s experience from the initial call to the discussion of treatment plans will be focused on their overall health through achieving a healthy mouth. </p>\n<p>The content and messaging of a dentist’s website are valuable because you are educating patients about the practice, what the goal of the practice is, and the reason the patient needs it. Our clients can help build a positive relationship with patients for regular checkups in the future. We will ensure that patients receive your message about Complete Health Dentistry through your website and online marketing.</p>\n<h2>Selling Health Through Educating Content</h2>\n<p>Patients are becoming better informed about dental care as our culture continues to increase its emphasis on the importance of a healthy lifestyle. With educating content, dentists can help patients understand the importance of proper dental care and how to receive it.</p>\n<h4>How can educating content help increase the flow of patients?</h4>\n<p>Our premium plans feature additional services that allow for customized content such as website copy, dental service pages, blogs, etc. We can develop content that sends the right message for what your practice is all about, combining SEO value to help increase your rankings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">Click here to learn more about educating content and how it can help you.</a></p>\n<h4>How can you help my website rank?</h4>\n<p>While helping a website to remain active, Doctor Genius continues to monitor and stay up to date on <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">Google’s algorithm updates</a>. When Google changes the way their search algorithm operates, there is a chance that a website’s position on a search results list will fluctuate. Even though this can work in favor of certain fields (medical, entertainment, news, etc.), other websites can face lower ranking. Many feel the effects of a core update may seemingly be unpredictable. However, our team tracks industry experts and corporate publications to follow the breadcrumbs that reveal where Google will likely shift focus on what content ranking is more important. </p>\n<h2>Reach Out to Us and Re-Invent Your Practice for Success</h2>\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about the Complete Health Practice and how Gary Kadi can help you formulate a plan of action visit, <a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram\">https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram</a>.

The debate persists partially due to the incorrect assumption that content that appears as duplication will automatically be categorized as spam by search engines. At Doctor Genius, we strive to provide the most up-to-date and accurate information for your business. That&#8217;s why learning more about how content duplication affects your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">rankings</a> can help you make informed decisions about the focus of your marketing and content strategies. </p>\r\n<h2>Should businesses avoid duplicate content? </h2>\r\n<p>When thinking about repetitive content on the web, it&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of believing that if your information is too similar to existing information, it will be automatically be ranked lower on searches. Since somewhere between 25-30% of information on the web is repetitive, it would do a great disservice to consider all of it useless or spam. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZY7EmjbMA&amp;feature=emb_title\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZY7EmjbMA&amp;feature=emb_title\">Search engine programming has evolved</a> to anticipate duplicated information and provide solutions. </p>\r\n<h3>What is duplicate content? </h3>\r\n<p>Content on the internet that is duplicated can be due to the same page being used for multiple locations of the same company or through small parts of existing content being directly reused in blogs as a reference to the original material. Although sometimes duplications are used as manipulation or with malicious intent, such as trying to pass off reused content as new, original content, most of the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en-\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en-\">duplicated content</a> on the web is harmless. Often, multiple variations of the same information end up as duplicate content due to publishing both HTTP and HTTPS versions of websites, pages in different languages, and both www and non-www pages. When the same pages are optimized for both website and mobile use, it can also create repetitive content for search engines. </p>\r\n<h3>How do search engines treat duplicate content? </h3>\r\n<p>Search engines, such as Google, look for identical or very similar pages as a regular part of the content ranking process. Instead of rejecting search results that are the same, the results are instead grouped together under the same search. Similar articles appear as alternative options to the first-ranked article instead of being edited out of the search entirely. Whenever possible, the original source of the content ranks highest along with the webpages that have the most visitors. Google, in particular, has updated algorithms to make sure webmasters aren&#8217;t penalized in the rankings due to content duplication. </p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about SEO content</h2>\r\n<p>The idea that duplicate content on the web hurts companies by negatively affecting rankings is a myth that has been perpetuated by predatory SEO competitors. As confirmed by search engine engineers and major companies, repetitive content is expected and accounted for during the programming process, so it does not cause a problem unless it is purposefully overwhelming to the point of spam or clearly tries to pass off some else&#8217;s original content as their own. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Reach out to us</a> to speak with a team member and learn more about our available services. </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
