In today&#8217;s world where many potential<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/advice-for-dealing-with-negative-yelp-and-google-reviews/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>You work hard to build a successful medical practice and establish an excellent reputation. In today&#8217;s world where many potential patients choose a medical practice based on the online reviews of previous patients, it is critical to know how to handle negative reviews. Learning about patient review management can help you not only deal with poor reviews but also grow your practice. </p>\r\n<h2>How reviews affect search engine rankings</h2>\r\n<p>The algorithm Google uses when someone searches for your practice pulls reviews from many platforms such as Yelp, Google, and Facebook. While one bad review on Google may not be enough to disrupt your ranking, one patient who leaves a negative review across multiple platforms can cause your ranking to fall. All it takes is a few patients with a negative perception of your practice to leave reviews on several websites, and your ranking, as well as the reputation and credibility of your practice, can suffer. Because of this, it is critical to handle poor reviews quickly and professionally. </p>\r\n<h2>Turning negative reviews into a positive patient experience</h2>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/03/bad-reviews-can-boost-sales-heres-why\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/03/bad-reviews-can-boost-sales-heres-why\">Harvard Business Review</a>, bad reviews can actually be good for business when handled correctly. Here is how this can be accomplished. </p>\r\n<h3>Respond to the review in a timely manner</h3>\r\n<p>Ignoring a negative review is the worst thing you can do. Silence only reinforces the patient&#8217;s perception that you and your practice do not care about them. However, it is equally important to plan your response carefully and understand the patient&#8217;s situation before responding. </p>\r\n<h3>Properly assess the situation</h3>\r\n<p>Taking the time to figure out what went wrong can not only allow you to respond appropriately but also help you prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Ask questions of your staff about what was said or done that perhaps could have been misinterpreted. If there is any recorded correspondence, such as phone calls, voice mails, or emails, listen to or read through those to better understand what happened. </p>\r\n<h3>Make the situation right</h3>\r\n<p>When a bad review is handled correctly, it shows your dedication to patient experience and care. It can be reassuring for potential patients to understand that if there are any incidents during an appointment or procedure, they will be taken seriously and dealt with correctly. </p>\r\n<h3>Express your gratitude to the customer</h3>\r\n<p>Every unhappy patient is an opportunity to make your practice better. Many times, patients who have a poor experience never take the time to leave a review. Rather, they will avoid your practice or speak poorly of it to others. By leaving a review, the patient gives you the chance to make things right and earn back their trust. Saying thank you to a patient is a wonderful way to bring closure to a potentially disruptive situation.</p>\r\n<h2>Improve your online presence </h2>\r\n<p>With an increasing number of people looking at online reviews and top-ranked business listings, strategic SEO for medical practices can have a tremendous impact on your practice.

It allows practices to become more visible in high-traffic areas online. There is more than meets the eye on these forums, and understanding the useful features may help raise your practice&#8217;s online presence. Doing this can ultimately net you more website views and potential clients. Find out how to raise your healthcare SEO by creating a calendar to post content to your practice&#8217;s social media accounts automatically.</p>\r\n<h2>Medical practice marketing using social media</h2>\r\n<p>People have become reliant on social media for providing insight into potential products and services. Hashtags have become a starting point for everything from news articles to reviews. Using hashtags and SEO keywords in blog posts makes it more likely that your content is seen. The more relevant and engaging content you post, the higher your webpage views can climb and yield new clients for your practice. Creating content to post across social media allows your practice to harness the power of social engagement to engage potential clients and drive business to your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Planning a content calendar for doctors</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/\">Creating content for your practice</a> should be a priority if you wish to grow. It is important that blog posts are put up with some regularity. This ensures your practice continues to appear high in SEO rankings on social media. Finding an effective way to post content frequently may come down to using a social media calendar.</p>\r\n<h3>Promote your practice regularly</h3>\r\n<p>You use a calendar to plan your day and schedule patients. It allows you to see upcoming events and ensure that you have the necessary tools well in advance. The same logic applies to a social media calendar. This tool allows you to plan your practice&#8217;s blogs in advance and have them automatically posted on the days and times you choose. Scheduling posts helps you to maximize timing trends for social media users. Utilize a social media calendar for your practice to provide a steady stream of insight to users.</p>\r\n<h3>Capitalize on healthcare trends</h3>\r\n<p>Coming up with relevant topics may be one of the most difficult parts of writing blog posts. You want to create engaging posts that drive traffic to your practice&#8217;s website from social media outlets. A calendar can help with content planning by allowing you to capitalize on relevant <a href=\"https://nationaltoday.com/health-holidays/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://nationaltoday.com/health-holidays/\">healthcare awareness days</a>. Blog posts centered around these medical topics and how they relate back to your practice can be written on your timetable but set to post on social media during the relevant dates. This ultimately raises the practice&#8217;s visibility during these times.</p>\r\n<h2>Let our content creators help!</h2>\r\n<p>Perhaps you do not have the in-house resources to create a steady stream of content for your blog and social media pages.

Here are methods to use when deciding on a lawyer for your dental practice. </p>\r\n<h3>Consult online resources</h3>\r\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of using a search engine like Google as you begin your query is the ability to see reviews from previous clients. Although some opinions may be a bit extreme, reviews can typically provide a general overview of how professional and successful a lawyer has been in the past. </p>\r\n<h3>Take advantage of your network</h3>\r\n<p>Odds are good you know someone at another practice who has used a dental lawyer before, a friend or relative who is a lawyer in this area, or experience with dental law. Be bold about asking peers for a referral. People are not likely to recommend someone to you unless they know that person will do a good job. </p>\r\n<h3>Use a lawyer referral service</h3>\r\n<p>Many state and local bar associations often have a lawyer referral service. The lawyers these services refer people to are generally well known and respected in their communities and have a proven track record of success. If this is the route you choose to go, it is more about picking the lawyer who is the right fit for your practice than having to decide whether the lawyer is competent. </p>\r\n<h3>Ask your malpractice carrier</h3>\r\n<p>Because all operating medical practices should have a malpractice carrier, this option is relatively simple. You should already have a representative and a phone number or email address handy. Contact your malpractice representative and ask about respected lawyers who have handled cases similar to yours. </p>\r\n<h3>Talk to your state dental association</h3>\r\n<p>Some state dental associations have approved referral lists of law firms and attorneys. Because these lists typically include lawyers from all over the state, it is important to be aware of the location of the lawyers you are most interested in. If you need legal advice in a specialized area, make sure to ask what kind of experience the lawyer has in that area specifically. </p>\r\n<h2>Turn to us for help</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you need a dental lawyer, assistance with <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\">medical marketing</a>, or ideas on how to improve patient retention, Doctor Genius has you covered.
