This action plan will allow you<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/using-kaizen-as-an-action-plan-for-your-practice/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>If you strive to improve your practice, a Kaizen action plan is a must. This action plan will allow you to make small changes that create continuous improvement for employees, patients, and the practice as a whole. These changes are small but can make a huge impact on your practice’s processes and functions. For this to work, you need to develop and use an action plan.</p>\r\n<h2>Plan, do, check and act with a Kaizen action plan</h2>\r\n<p>Many practices like the idea of the Kaizen philosophy but do not understand how to implement it. Successful practices often pair the PDCA cycle (plan, do check and act) with the Kaizen philosophy to get results. The two strategies support one another and allow practices to make small, measurable, and sustainable improvements. Also, this strategy involves employees, increasing engagement throughout the practice.</p>\r\n<h3>The “Plan” stage</h3>\r\n<p>A Kaizen action plan should begin with the “plan” stage. Just as it sounds, practices must plan the strategy before moving to the next step. During the stage, employees identify a problem. For instance, the problem could be something as simple as long wait times. After the problem is determined, the practice must gather data related to it.</p>\r\n<p>Then, the practice must find a solution to the problem. The solution might be avoiding double-booking patients or changing a policy about seeing late patients. Involved parties need to consider the possible outcomes of implementing the solution, as well as a method for measuring its success. All changes must be measurable for the action plan to work.</p>\r\n<h3>The “do” stage</h3>\r\n<p>During the “do” stage, the practice implements the plan. Someone needs to be in charge of collecting data when implementing the plan. The data should clearly show if the plan helps the practice. All data is carried over to the next stage when the practice determines if the plan is viable.</p>\r\n<h3>The “check” stage</h3>\r\n<p>Team members should analyze the data during the “check” stage to see if the plan worked as expected. Did it generate the anticipated results? Did the plan help the practice? Is the solution practical and helpful instead of disruptive? Practices need to ask these questions to determine how effective the plan was.</p>\r\n<h3>The “act” stage</h3>\r\n<p>The “act” stage is the last part of the action plan. If the plan worked, the practice needs to announce the change to all employees. It is also essential to add any changes to practice training materials and handbooks. If it did not work, the practice needs to start the process once again. Some changes do not work, but if practices go back to the drawing board, they will find a solution to the problem.</p>\r\n<h2>Make positive changes with Kaizen</h2>\r\n<p>A Kaizen action plan will help you make positive changes for your practice. Train your employees on this strategy and have everyone take part in developing a plan. When you open your practice up to suggestions, you can make important changes that improve satisfaction for employees and patients. This will help you retain employees and patients and allow your practice to generate more revenue.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

We also offer free informational resources to help practices quickly learn more about the COVID-19 pandemic and how it may affect their practice. </p>\r\n<h2>Altering your practice&#8217;s approach for COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has made it more challenging in the healthcare industry. Many practices that primarily offer elective or non-emergency services are finding it more challenging to acquire new patients. Healthcare practices that deal directly with the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 find themselves more vulnerable and must take more precautions when dealing with patients.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless, every practice is affected in one way or another. Thus, practices must temporarily alter their approach to be more accommodating to the needs of patients and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>\r\n<h3>Digital marketing strategies to recover from COVID-19</h3>\r\n<p>One way to minimize the financial impact COVID-19 has on your practice and recover faster is through implementing digital marketing tools and strategies. Offline marketing such as billboard advertisements, medical conferences, etc. are not as effective because more are staying home for social distancing purposes. However, the use of digital devices is likely to increase. This increase in usage means practices need to alter their methods for reaching patients to help stay afloat.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius offers digital marketing tools to assist with healthcare recovery. Utilizing strategies such as improving web design in anticipation of more traffic, writing more informative content with content marketing, and using detailed keyword analysis reports to optimize on-page content are great ways to continue marketing.  </p>\r\n<h3>Informational resources for COVID-19</h3>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius also offers free informational resources for practices.
