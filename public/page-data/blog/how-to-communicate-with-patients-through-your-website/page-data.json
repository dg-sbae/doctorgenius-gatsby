More practices are moving toward this approach to retain current patients and establish relationships with new ones. By designating a specific area of your site to communicate with patients, you are increasing beneficial information flow between your business and patients while improving your SEO strategies. To take full advantage of your website, you must understand the various forms of communication you can implement and how to optimize usage.  </p>\r\n<h2>Communication options</h2>\r\n<p>There are many ways you can communicate daily with patients. In fact, offering an online communication service usually opens your business up to optimal 24/7 service for anyone who needs help. It also provides more <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\">access to mobile users</a>, who make up about half of all online interactions. You can incorporate more than one of these options into your site to increase accessibility.</p>\r\n<h3>Online messaging</h3>\r\n<p>Those familiar with social media will know that online messaging is a common form of communication across apps and websites. Almost all banks, law offices, and online stores have turned to online messaging to quickly and concisely interact with customers. You can create a segment in the sidebar of your website or a popup message window that allows visitors to send a message immediately — whichever your site architecture accommodates. By putting a place for messages at the forefront of your site, you provide an easy and effective route for customers to reach you.</p>\r\n<h3>Email</h3>\r\n<p>With so many other communication options available today, it can be easy to think that emails are going out of style. This is far from true, and many companies actually generate a large amount of business through a regularly scheduled email newsletter. While many people may not yet be familiar or comfortable with online messaging, emails are simple and reliable. Extra security measures may be needed to ensure patient privacy to help patients and physicians feel more at ease. Overall, email is cost-effective, and you can include your address on a contact information page on your site for customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Integrated online messaging</h3>\r\n<p>Similar to regular online messaging, the integrated system goes a step further to include patient information for the physician during a live communication. A physician can view the patient’s medical record while talking to them, and all messages automatically become a part of the patient’s record as the conversation progresses. This gives patients necessary connectivity while providing physicians with the tools for a successful engagement.</p>\r\n<h2>Why online communication matters</h2>\r\n<p>Many people, especially those of younger generations, feel more comfortable communicating via online sources than over the phone. Broadening the number of opportunities patients have to connect with you makes it easier to accommodate different schedules and lifestyles. Of course, simply having an online communication system is not enough — you still need to incorporate an <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2017/02/09/how-to-build-strong-customer-relationships-online/#57f492341295\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2017/02/09/how-to-build-strong-customer-relationships-online/#57f492341295\">inviting personal touch</a> to make a human connection even though the interaction is through a screen.</p>\r\n<h2>Reach out for a greater understanding of online communication</h2>\r\n<p>Never let a lack of knowledge about online tactics prevent you from getting the most out of your website. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for more insights on expanding your online audience and generating engaging content to increase communication with your patients.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

When that person leaves without exploring the site past the page originally clicked on, this is called a bounce. The bounce rate is calculated based on the number of people who exit your webpage before clicking on any of your other pages. The more people who leave prematurely, the higher your website’s bounce rate is.</p>\r\n<p>Higher bounce rates are bad for business because they mean fewer visitors are converting. Converting can involve completing any number of actions, such as sending a digital message, filling out the newsletter signup form, or buying a product. By decreasing bounce rate, you can increase your audience and business.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to reduce bounce rate</h2>\r\n<p>A great bounce rate is around 30-50%, while a poor bounce rate can land above 80%. You can view your overall bounce rate and the bounce rate of specific pages on Google Analytics or another <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close\">analytic alternative</a>. Identifying which pages have the highest rate on your website can give you a specific area to focus on instead of trying to rework the content design and SEO strategy of your entire site at once. Here are changes you can make to a page to decrease bounce rate.</p>\r\n<h3>Make content easier to read</h3>\r\n<p>Large blocks of text are much harder to digest than text that is broken up and formatted to please the eye. Using subheadings, bullet points, images, charts, and occasional bolded keywords can make it easier for people to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">scan your content</a> and find links to other pages. If you have various types of pages (blogs, articles, contact pages, etc.), create style guides for each that make sure all posts adhere to the right format and are easier to read.  </p>\r\n<h3>Employ strong calls to action</h3>\r\n<p>Experiment with calls to action to see what attracts readers to click on services you offer and engage more with your site. Some may stand stronger above the rest, and you may find that others do not receive as much attention. By establishing a powerful call to action, you entice visitors to sign up for newsletters and explore more parts of your site.</p>\r\n<h3>Improve usability</h3>\r\n<p>Your site should be appealing from the first second a visitor lands on it. Anything that looks clunky, jarring, or confusing is likely to lose newcomers quickly, and in an age when online attention spans last mere seconds, creating a captivating hook is essential. Double-check that your site is easy to navigate and that finding information is not a hassle. Your site should also be able to translate smoothly from any device and screen size. A majority of users browse the internet on a mobile device, so the last thing you want is a site that looks terrible on a small screen.</p>\r\n<h2>Reach out for more great ideas</h2>\r\n<p>Every website is different, and the creation of user-friendly, attractive pages should be tailored to individual business needs.

According to a survey of mobile usage conducted <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017.\">statista.com</a> between 2015 and 2020, more than half of online traffic worldwide occurred on a mobile device. Chances are, customers are visiting your site on their phones more than any other device. It is crucial to design site architecture that can translate from a desktop user to a mobile user without issue. Here are strategies to develop a site that optimizes mobile use while still remaining accessible to all other devices.</p>\r\n<h2>Going from desktop to mobile</h2>\r\n<p>A user should be able to flip from a desktop browser to a mobile browser and still recognize your pages as the same site, just in a slightly different format. A site that fails to load properly on anything other than a desktop is more likely to lose potential customers visiting for the first time. Before you create an entirely separate page specifically for mobile use, check to see if your site already has a responsive design that can convert the layout from one device to another.</p>\r\n<h3>Website responsiveness</h3>\r\n<p>Responsiveness refers to a site’s ability to appear cohesive, uniform, and similar on any device, regardless of each device’s screen size. The site’s pages and links should remain the same, with small changes that adapt it for easy mobile use. With newer website templates, this may already be the case. If not, there are plenty of tools available online to help design a website with proper responsiveness.</p>\r\n<h2>Strategies to make a mobile site easier to use</h2>\r\n<p>Before designing your mobile site, answer several key questions about your audience:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>What information is your audience looking for most often?</li>\r\n\t<li>What questions and answers do visitors frequently search for on your website?</li>\r\n\t<li>What pages are most popular on your site?</li>\r\n\t<li>What do you want customers to know about your business?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When people use mobile devices — frequently phones — they are usually looking for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">quick answers to short questions</a>. Identifying those questions can help you establish SEO and ideal content for mobile users specifically. You can use Google Analytics to track the traffic that comes to your site to determine what answers people get on your site. From there, consider the following points to implement to make this content more accessible on a mobile platform:</p>\r\n<h3>Consistent screen width</h3>\r\n<p>There is nothing more irritating than having to scroll horizontally to see an entire webpage on your phone. Make sure that the full width of your site is visible on each screen size. This may mean changing how content appears on the screen.</p>\r\n<h3>Expandable images</h3>\r\n<p>Since phones offer a limited viewing space, many users prefer images that can expand. This makes it easier to see products and pictures that appear smaller than usual on the screen.</p>\r\n<h3>Single tabs only</h3>\r\n<p>Moving between separate browser tabs on a small device can be challenging. Ensuring that links to other pages remain in the same tab can minimize user frustration and route customers back to your site.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more ways to make mobile sites</h2>\r\n<p>Understanding how to reach the right audience on a mobile platform is a large part of business success.
