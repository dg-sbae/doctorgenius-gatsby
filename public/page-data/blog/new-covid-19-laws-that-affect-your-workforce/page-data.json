As knowledge about the virus evolves, and as cases of affected patients continue to rise, community responses and government regulations also evolve to help practices safely manage patients&#8217; health, protect their staff&#8217;s safety, and remain financially solvent. Below are several of these new laws and protocols that likely affect your medical practice, plus recommended and required steps to take.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though current at the time of writing, these regulations and guidelines are subject to change, so be sure to verify with official sources.</span></p>\r\n<h2><b>OSHA Regulations and New Protocols</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of its efforts to protect workers from on-the-job hazards, the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration (OSHA) issued interim guidance for specific worker groups and their employers, with</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html#healthcare\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> specific instructions to health care employers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. OSHA&#8217;s infection prevention recommendations include engineering controls (such as the use of physical barriers between patients and staff), administrative controls (such as isolating patients and minimizing staff present for procedures), and safe work practices (like avoiding unnecessary touching of surfaces) to help protect workers from COVID-19 exposure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers of health care workers remain responsible for following applicable OSHA requirements. Workplaces such as dental offices and medical practices with occupational exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials, including saliva in dental procedures, must comply with OSHA&#8217;s</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bloodborne Pathogens</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> standards. These standards include the practice of universal safety precautions. While employers still are responsible for complying with OSHA&#8217;s</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.132\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Personal Protective Equipment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> standards, which includes the</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Respiratory Protection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> standard, OSHA is providing temporary flexibility for certain requirements under these and other standards. Specifically, OSHA has issued</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> temporary enforcement guidance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> related to the executive order making general use respirators available to health care personnel during the COVID-19 emergency.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Personal Protective Equipment</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers must provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to staff to limit their potential exposure to infectious hazards. Workers who must use PPE must be trained on when to use it, what equipment is necessary, how to put on and take off PPE to prevent self-contamination, how to dispose of or disinfect PPE properly, how to maintain PPE, and limitations of the PPE safely. Applicable standards include </span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.133\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eye and Face Protection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.138\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hand Protection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.138\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Respiratory Protection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recommended PPE for health care personnel who interact with patients or could be exposed to contaminated materials include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation gowns</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nitrile exam gloves</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified, disposable N95 or better respirators</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eye and face protection, such as goggles and face shield</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given supply chain shortages of PPE across the country, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) updated its </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommendations to allow facemasks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an acceptable alternative to N95 respirators, with respirators prioritized for use in procedures more likely to generate respiratory aerosols. Practices should preserve their inventory of PPE as much as reasonably possible. In case of shortage, PPE protocols may require modification to allow the reuse of equipment or allow alternatives that do not meet the standards.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Required Training</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers also are responsible for training workers about:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources of occupational exposure to the virus</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appropriate workplace protocols to prevent or reduce exposure</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to isolate people with suspected COVID-19</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to report possible cases to public health authorities</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All training must be provided during scheduled work times for free to the employee. Refer to </span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/training/library\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSHA&#8217;s reference library</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for training resources.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>State-Specific Standards</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twenty-eight states have OSHA-approved State Plans, which could include more stringent or extensive standards. For example, the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) mandates certain employers follow the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/OHB/Pages/ATDStd.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aerosol Transmissible Diseases (ATD)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> standard. Employers must follow the stricter guidelines, where both state and federal regulations exist.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perform a </span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/hazardrecognition.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hazard assessment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that identifies potential sources of exposure.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establish office protocols to minimize risks of exposure, including limiting patients, prohibiting visitors, screening staff, and patients for symptoms, disinfecting surfaces more frequently and more.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consult the CDC&#8217;s </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review OSHA standards, especially </span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloodborne Pathogens</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.132\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Personal Protective Equipment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Respiratory Protection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review applicable state occupational standards.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure your staff has adequate PPE, and they know how to use it properly.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory your PPE and prioritize the use in case of shortages.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide training to staff as required by OSHA.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-employer-paid-leave\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> includes the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act (EPSLA) and the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act (EFMLEA). Enacted into federal law on March 18, 2020, the legislation is effective April 1, 2020, until December 31, 2020. These laws cover all private employers with fewer than 500 employees and require them to provide paid leave to employees under certain circumstances related to COVID-19. The U.S. Department of Labor&#8217;s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) administers and enforces the requirements.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Emergency Sick Leave</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered employers who are not electing an exception (see below) must provide any employee two weeks (up to 80 hours for full-time employees) of emergency paid sick leave in certain circumstances, detailed below. This sick leave is available to all employees, regardless of their length of employment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency sick leave must be paid at the worker&#8217;s regular rate of pay if the employee cannot work because:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The employee is quarantined on the advice of a health care provider</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The employee is under a federal, state, or local government isolation order</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The employee is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that the amount paid is subject to </span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-questions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aggregate caps</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Sick leave for one of the above reasons is limited to a maximum benefit payment of $511 per day, or $5,110 total over the entire emergency paid sick leave time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the employee cannot work because of a need to care for someone subject to quarantine (pursuant to government order or health care provider advice) or to care for a child under 18 years of age whose school or child care provider is closed for COVID-19 related reasons, then the employee is eligible for up to 80 hours (two weeks) of emergency paid sick leave paid at two-thirds the employee&#8217;s regular rate of pay. In these circumstances, the sick leave benefit pays a maximum of $200 per day or $2,000 over the entire two week period.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that the employee cannot take emergency paid sick leave both for themselves and to care for another; the total hours of emergency paid sick leave cannot exceed 80 hours. Also, note that you cannot require an employee to first exhaust other paid leave. You must grant emergency sick leave in addition to any pre-existing leave benefits.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Emergency FMLA</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered employers must provide employees that have been employed for at least 30 days with up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave when an employee cannot work. The reason for the employee&#8217;s absence must be a need to care for a child under 18 years of age whose school or child care provider is closed for reasons related to COVID-19. Employees are to be paid two-thirds of their regular rate of pay for the hours they would have been scheduled to work during that period. The maximum pay is $200 per day, or $12,000 in the aggregate if the employee takes two weeks of paid emergency sick leave followed by 10 weeks of emergency leave.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Exceptions</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers with less than 50 employees or who are health care providers under the FFCRA&#8217;s definition may provide FFCRA paid leave to their employees, or they may elect for an exemption to the requirements. According to the regulations, an employer might need to rely on the exemption if it determines that:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing paid sick leave or expanded FMLA would cause the business to cease operating at a minimal capacity because expenses would exceed revenue</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The absence of the employee requesting paid sick leave or expanded FMLA would pose a substantial risk to the finances or operational capabilities of the business because of the employee&#8217;s specialized skills or responsibilities</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are not sufficient workers able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or services of the employee requesting paid sick leave or expanded FMLA, and the labor or services are needed to operate at minimal capacity</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Tax Credits</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered employers qualify for </span><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/covid-19-related-tax-credits-for-required-paid-leave-provided-by-small-and-midsize-businesses-faqs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tax credits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that provide dollar-for-dollar reimbursement for all qualifying emergency paid sick leave or expanded FMLA wages paid under the FFCRA, up to the aggregate payment caps. The fully refundable tax credits also include the employer&#8217;s share of Medicare tax for those wages and the cost of maintaining health insurance coverage for the employee during the sick leave period. The employer is not subject to the employer portion of social security tax imposed on those wages. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers claim the credits on their federal employment tax returns, but they can benefit more quickly by reducing their federal employment tax deposits. If there are not enough federal employment taxes to cover the amount of the credits, employers may request an advance payment of the credits from the IRS by submitting a </span><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-7200\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post the required FFCRA notice according to the</span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-poster-questions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> notice posting requirements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The notice must be in clearly visible locations and sent to remote staff. To obtain notices free of charge, contact the WHD at 1-866-4-USWAGE (1-866-487-9243), or download and</span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/posters/FFCRA_Poster_WH1422_Non-Federal.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> print the notice</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> yourself from</span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determine whether your practice will require the use of the exemption to FFCRA.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to policies around requiring symptomatic or at-risk employees to stay home, create policies regarding emergency sick leave, and expanded FMLA.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your practice will not be taking exception to FFCRA and intends to obtain tax credits, thoroughly document the staff absences and leaves taken for COVID-19 related reasons, including specific details such as the names and ages of children, the name of the closed school or child care provider, etc.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retain a copy of Form 941, Employer&#8217;s Quarterly Federal Tax Return.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Local and State Sick and Family Leave</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several cities and states have enacted their own emergency sick leave and paid family leave requirements to expand protections beyond the federal programs. For example, </span><a href=\"https://sfgov.org/olse/san-francisco-paid-sick-leave-coronavirus\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco issued new guidance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that requires covered employers in the city to let employees use accrued sick leave for several COVID-19 related reasons. San Francisco also created the </span><a href=\"https://sfmayor.org/article/mayor-breed-announces-plan-provide-paid-sick-leave-workers-impacted-coronavirus\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workers and Families First Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to offer financial incentives for businesses to provide an additional five days of sick leave pay.  </span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consult your city government, state labor agencies, and benefits providers to find out whether you have additional employment laws to follow for sick leave or family leave.</span></p>\r\n<h2><b>Restrictions on Different Practice Types</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) issued &#8220;</span><a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-non-emergent-elective-medical-recommendations.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Emergent, Elective Medical Services, and Treatment Recommendations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; to guide practices in determining what health care they should postpone during the COVID-19 crisis. Many state governments, state medical boards, and local jurisdictions have issued restrictions on different practices and different procedures. The intent of the restrictions is to help prevent the spread of the virus by limiting potential contact with infected persons, preserve the availability of health care personnel to care for patients affected by COVID-19, ration use of limited supplies of PPE, and save additional hospital space to care for infected patients. Generally, all licensed health care providers should postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately necessary to prevent serious adverse medical consequences or death.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many states have issued orders specific to specialty. For example, in California, the Department of Public Health issued &#8220;</span><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/GuidanceforDentistry.aspx#\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 Guidance for Dentistry</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&#8221; The directive:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advises dentists to postpone all routine, cosmetic, and non-emergency care indefinitely</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Requires dentists be available to their patients of record for emergency care</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instructs dentists to screen each patient to be sure they are asymptomatic and have not been exposed to someone with COVID-19</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Details protocols for treating patients for emergency dental issues</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review any federal, state, professional, or CDC directives applicable to your specialty and your location.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postpone any elective or cosmetic surgeries, as well as non-emergency procedures.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoroughly document any decisions to proceed with treatment or delay scheduled procedures and surgeries.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Develop guidelines for allowable office visits.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow up-to-date guidance on</span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-laws-what-workplaces-need-to-do-if-an-employee-or-patient-gets-the-covid-19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> treating patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Special Considerations for Contract Staff</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Independent contractors are not employees. They are not eligible for emergency sick leave or expanded FMLA under the FFCRA, and you cannot claim tax credits. However, there are a few financial assistance resources possibly available to contract staff.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, eligibility criteria are expanded to include people not typically eligible for unemployment insurance. The CARES Act provides for</span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20200402-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for independent contractors and self-employed individuals who have lost employment or have reduced hours of work as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contract staff (and your practice) might qualify for a $10,000</span><a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/economic-injury-disaster-loan-emergency-advance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through the Small Business Administration, as well as the</span><a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program-ppp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Paycheck Protection Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs, enacted through the CARES Act, provide temporary, immediate relief for small businesses, self-employed individuals, and independent contractors. The funds are intended to pay for payroll expenses, as well as some operating expenses like rent and utilities.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special note to California practices or practices that use California-based workers: With legislation effective January 1, 2020, classification of workers as independent contractors narrowed significantly. While</span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Assembly Bill No. 5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (AB5) exempts physicians and dentists, nurses, physician&#8217;s assistants, behavioral health providers, medical transcriptionists, and more are subject to the law. By default, everyone not exempted is considered an employee; businesses bear the burden of ensuring an individual fulfills the criteria of the so-called ABC test for independent contractors.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a worker you treated as an independent contractor attempts to file for standard unemployment insurance, the state Employment Development Department (EDD) likely will audit your working relationship to determine whether the classification was correct. The EDD could determine the individual should have been classified as a W2 wage employee. In that case, you will be liable for the back payment of employment taxes.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review</span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/financing-options-now-available-resulting-from-covid-19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> available resources for financial assistance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, if needed.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If in California, review the potential impact of the AB5 legislation on your classification of workers as independent contractors.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Stay-at-home Orders and Social Distancing Protocols</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No federal stay-at-home order has been issued, though the White House recommends the country follow social distancing measures. However, up to 97 percent of the United States population is subject to state and/or local stay-at-home orders. Nearly all stay-at-home orders include exceptions related to essential activities and purposes, including health care. Most stay-at-home orders do not consider elective medical procedures and surgeries to be essential, and as such, prohibit them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though physicians&#8217; offices, dental practices, and other health care providers generally are considered essential businesses, many city, county, or state jurisdictions have imposed mandatory social distancing protocols.

Now more than ever, medical practices need to find an effective way to reach patients in homes that will need treatment. It is possible to start rebounding now so your practice will be stronger than ever.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some tips to position your practice as a local leader during and after the pandemic.</p>\r\n<h2>Three ways to thrive during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Even when the pandemic reaches its peak, there will be a need for local practices. Local practices are the backbone of communities and can thrive by adapting to the new normal. This includes embracing technology and increasing the commitment to health standards.</p>\r\n<p>Practices also need to connect with clients via social media and online. Offices that do these three things can be industry leaders well before the pandemic is under control.</p>\r\n<h3>Embrace technology</h3>\r\n<p>Right now, big tech is in the position to come out ahead when the coronavirus pandemic comes to an end. With most Americans engaged in strict social distancing, people are more reliant on technology than ever before. While big tech might take the lead, businesses of all types can rebound by embracing technology. This will help businesses today and well after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>\r\n<p>The medical community is already doing this. Physicians now see large numbers of patients via video chat and phone calls. Even dentists have joined in, using teledentistry to evaluate patients and give second opinions. Businesses that use technology will rebound during the COVID-19 crisis and be on solid footing when it ends.</p>\r\n<h3>Show a commitment to health standards</h3>\r\n<p>People are afraid right now, and that fear will not disappear after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Businesses can start rebounding now by reaching out to clients and telling them what they are doing to prevent the spread of the disease. Also, these businesses should explain that these standards are not just in place for the pandemic. The health of patients is always a priority.</p>\r\n<h3>Stay connected with social media</h3>\r\n<p>Brands like Instacart and Dial have increased social media spend during COVID-19, and that makes sense. Both brands appeal to consumers during this crisis. Still, all businesses can benefit from being active on social media during this time. People spend more time online right now, and social media marketing is a good way to reach customers.</p>\r\n<p>Many people turn to local practices for information regarding COVID-19. Dentists, physicians, and others can use social media to get messages out to the public at large. This can include information about the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve. Doctors and dentists can also use the channel to help people take preventative measures for their physical and oral health.</p>\r\n<p>These practices can also help lighten the mood on social media. With so much frightening information, funny memes can help followers relax. The key is to find the sweet spot between informative and entertaining posts. Practices do not want to make the mistake of always providing humor when followers also need guidance.</p>\r\n<h2>Start rebounding today</h2>\r\n<p>With a vaccine for COVID-19 months away, you cannot wait until the pandemic is over to get to work. If you wait too long, you will have a hard time rebounding. Between technology, a commitment to health, and an online presence, you will stay on people’s minds during this crisis. You can continue to see patients and build loyalty that will last well beyond the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

If<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/dental-teams-front-line-commitments/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>COVID-19 is affecting all health care providers, including dentists. As the pandemic rages on, dentists are on the frontlines. If you are a dentist, you are likely to continue conducting emergency procedures at your office. Also, you might find yourself helping at the local hospital. Find out more about the frontline commitments dental teams are facing.</p>\r\n<h2>Dental emergencies and COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Every 14 seconds, <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/Science%20and%20Research/HPI/Files/HPIgraphic_0819_1.pdf?la=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">someone visits a hospital or emergency room for a dental condition</a>, according to the American Dental Association. Dentists and physicians urge patients to go to dental offices instead. Going to dental offices takes the burden off hospitals. Also, dental patients will lower the risk of exposure by avoiding emergency rooms.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, the question then becomes how to know if a dentist is open during quarantine? The American Dental Association has created guidelines for dental emergencies. Patients should reach out to a dental office immediately if they experience one of these emergencies.</p>\r\n<h3>Bleeding or swelling</h3>\r\n<p>Bleeding or swelling in or around the mouth is a dental emergency. Gum infection, trauma, malnutrition, or pregnancy could cause mouth bleeding or swelling. After treating the problem, the patient should feel more comfortable. Also, fast treatment prevents infection from spreading. An infection can be dangerous, so patients should visit the dentist immediately. Failure to do so could lead to a more serious medical issue.</p>\r\n<h3>Tooth or jaw pain</h3>\r\n<p>Pain is a sign that something is wrong with the teeth or jaws. Pain could be caused by a cavity or infection, among other things. Unfortunately, untreated pain often continues to get worse. Patients who have pain should seek treatment quickly before it becomes unmanageable. The dentist can alleviate the pain and treat the condition.</p>\r\n<p>Investing in store-bought medication to relieve pain will only provide temporary relief. A dentist can help patients receive the lasting relief they need.</p>\r\n<h3>Broken or knocked-out teeth</h3>\r\n<p>Patients who have broken or knocked-out teeth need immediate care, even during the COVID-19 crisis. The dentist might be able to save the teeth. If not, the dentist can restore the teeth if needed. Failure to seek treatment will allow the teeth to shift. This could lead to bone loss and other oral problems.</p>\r\n<h3>Post-op care</h3>\r\n<p>Those who underwent dental surgery might want to put off post-operative care. Stitch removal and dressing changes are critical. Dentists still want patients to come in for these services. Offices are taking special precautions during the pandemic. These precautions limit the spread of the virus.</p>\r\n<h3>Dentists in hospitals</h3>\r\n<p>Dentists are also working on the frontlines in hospitals. Some dentists help other frontline workers by donating PPE equipment to fight COVID-19. Others are volunteering at local hospitals. For example, California is asking dentists to volunteer. More dentists will likely be needed in hospitals as the pandemic gets closer to the peak in the following months.</p>\r\n<h2>Providing valuable services during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created an all-hands-on-deck situation. Dentists have answered the call by providing emergency services and helping at hospitals. This crisis has brought dental and medical communities together. Both have the desire to reduce patient exposure and help those that are sick. With dentists joining the fight, hospitals are less overwhelmed and can provide the necessary care during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
