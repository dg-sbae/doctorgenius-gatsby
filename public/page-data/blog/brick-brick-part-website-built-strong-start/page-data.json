Without a strong foundation, the website will never accomplish what it sets out to do and much like the foundation of a house built on sand, it will fail under pressure. While DIY services make creating and maintaining a website easy, there is always someone working on the website’s code through the back door. However, it can be difficult to find a service specializing in website maintenance and design, while also specializing in content for various medical professions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Start off with a strong foot forward</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we strive to create an effective website with quality content pertaining to the client’s profession. From the first meeting, our team works with the client to create a website that meets the client’s needs and Google’s search engine specifications. One of the biggest factors to help a website rank high up near the top of search results is using keywords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keywords are terms or phrases that pertain to the client’s area of expertise and ranks highly due to popularity on search engines. A search engine will target keywords, to sum up the page and help direct people to the page. For instance, a dentist who uses the keyword “Teeth Whitening,” will be able to attract people to the website who are searching for that term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, keywords are only one of the first steps to building an effective website. We can help our clients start off with a strong foot forward with several crucial factors, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Constant website maintenance</li>\r\n \t<li>Technology to review ranking traffic</li>\r\n \t<li>Mobile-First website</li>\r\n \t<li>Regular website backups</li>\r\n \t<li>Call tracking system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>We are here to help every step of the way</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-26-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"A Website Built Strong From the Start\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-919\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-26-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-26-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-26-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Doctor Genius will provide the information about your website that you need on a regular basis, when you need it.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we do not stop after developing a website and continue to work with the client every step of the way.

Those numbers only continue to rise as social media becomes a dominating presence in the digital landscape. Companies and private practices alike are all using social media to reach social media users and convert them into patients/customers. Known as conversion, Doctor Genius has the right tools to help accomplish this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Engaging social media users</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While people believe that using a social media account is fairly easy, effectively using one to convert users into patients is exceedingly difficult. Hubspot finds that in 2017, approximately 74 percent of people use Facebook for professional purposes. Statista states that Facebook had 1.13 billion daily active users in 2016. Social media is a thriving platform for medical professionals to reach potential patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hootsuite.com defines conversion rate as “a positive action that is taken on a website by a visitor from social media,” adding that “The action demonstrates that the visitor is “converting” into a customer.” Even with a website, ranking high on search result is not an easy task. With how busy many medical professionals can get, maintaining a social media account can become exceedingly difficult. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can work to provide regular posts to engage followers on different social media accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engaging users on a regular basis is necessary for a social media account to reach potential patients and hold relevance on users’ feeds. In other words, if a social media page does not continue to make new posts and share content on a regular basis, people are less likely to even notice it in their feed. However, posting on a regular basis is only the first step.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Converting social media users into patients</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Necessary Tools for Conversion\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-931\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">Social Media Examiner found that in 2015, around 90 percent of all marketers using social media, generated more exposure for their business.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Posting content on social media is important but it is even more crucial to post content that brings users to a professional’s website. Thus, Doctor Genius provides the service to continue posting carefully-crafted posts on a regular basis for the client’s social media accounts. We will create and post content that connects back to the client’s website, making contact with the patient that much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal is to help your practice reach potential patients online who need your services.

Websites continue to try and keep up, only to find that there are multiple rules, regulations, and laws that seem to change constantly. Due to this, professionals in a variety of fields strive to keep up with the changes and help their website rank. With all of the challenges these changes present, Doctor Genius can help clients keep up with these changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What you need to know</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is beneficial for professionals to reach potential patients, clients or customers outside of the professionals’ local area, it is crucial to tap into the local market. While creating and maintaining a website is a crucial step, it is only the beginning. In order to rank, Google will scan a website for multiple factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Sitemap</li>\r\n \t<li>Keywords on the website that match popular search results</li>\r\n \t<li>The page title and meta description</li>\r\n \t<li>Inbound links</li>\r\n \t<li>Quantity and quality of words</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>By gaining notoriety and business with locals, professionals can create a solid source of profit with locals who will return in the future. Google is trying to provide a realistic experience for local users with information based on the exact time and location of the user. Thus, ranking in local search results is an important factor leading to one’s success. In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers who conducted local searches visited a store within five miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Joy Hawkins writes in an article on SearchEngineLand.com, “Google actively filters out listings from the local results that are similar to other listings that rank already,” adding that “Google picks the most relevant listing of the bunch and filters the rest.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This algorithm can actually help some businesses rank better on local search results, especially when there are other professionals offering similar services in the same profession. While Google will not go into the specifics of their updates, Doctor Genius can follow these updates and adjust accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius has the knowledge and expertise</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-909\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\"> In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers who conducted local searches visited a store within five miles.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The team at Doctor Genius has the knowledge and expertise to help patients rank on local search results.
