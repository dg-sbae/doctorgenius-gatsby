This action plan will allow you<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/using-kaizen-as-an-action-plan-for-your-practice/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>If you strive to improve your practice, a Kaizen action plan is a must. This action plan will allow you to make small changes that create continuous improvement for employees, patients, and the practice as a whole. These changes are small but can make a huge impact on your practice’s processes and functions. For this to work, you need to develop and use an action plan.</p>\r\n<h2>Plan, do, check and act with a Kaizen action plan</h2>\r\n<p>Many practices like the idea of the Kaizen philosophy but do not understand how to implement it. Successful practices often pair the PDCA cycle (plan, do check and act) with the Kaizen philosophy to get results. The two strategies support one another and allow practices to make small, measurable, and sustainable improvements. Also, this strategy involves employees, increasing engagement throughout the practice.</p>\r\n<h3>The “Plan” stage</h3>\r\n<p>A Kaizen action plan should begin with the “plan” stage. Just as it sounds, practices must plan the strategy before moving to the next step. During the stage, employees identify a problem. For instance, the problem could be something as simple as long wait times. After the problem is determined, the practice must gather data related to it.</p>\r\n<p>Then, the practice must find a solution to the problem. The solution might be avoiding double-booking patients or changing a policy about seeing late patients. Involved parties need to consider the possible outcomes of implementing the solution, as well as a method for measuring its success. All changes must be measurable for the action plan to work.</p>\r\n<h3>The “do” stage</h3>\r\n<p>During the “do” stage, the practice implements the plan. Someone needs to be in charge of collecting data when implementing the plan. The data should clearly show if the plan helps the practice. All data is carried over to the next stage when the practice determines if the plan is viable.</p>\r\n<h3>The “check” stage</h3>\r\n<p>Team members should analyze the data during the “check” stage to see if the plan worked as expected. Did it generate the anticipated results? Did the plan help the practice? Is the solution practical and helpful instead of disruptive? Practices need to ask these questions to determine how effective the plan was.</p>\r\n<h3>The “act” stage</h3>\r\n<p>The “act” stage is the last part of the action plan. If the plan worked, the practice needs to announce the change to all employees. It is also essential to add any changes to practice training materials and handbooks. If it did not work, the practice needs to start the process once again. Some changes do not work, but if practices go back to the drawing board, they will find a solution to the problem.</p>\r\n<h2>Make positive changes with Kaizen</h2>\r\n<p>A Kaizen action plan will help you make positive changes for your practice. Train your employees on this strategy and have everyone take part in developing a plan. When you open your practice up to suggestions, you can make important changes that improve satisfaction for employees and patients. This will help you retain employees and patients and allow your practice to generate more revenue.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

The content on a website can help to bring in potential patients through using keywords, SEO, and posting content regularly. At Doctor Genius, we can provide a steady flow of content to a client’s website, as well as managing the site as a whole. Therefore, as Google has just launched another core update, we are preparing for any changes that may come with its new algorithm.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within this new update, your website may experience changes in search results and the number of people who view your website. Here is what we know about the update and how we are here to help ensure the most effective search results for your practice’s website.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What We Know</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-may-2020-core-update-was-big-and-broad-search-data-tools-show-334393?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWW1GallqRmxNakZoWkdFdyIsInQiOiIrRWRcL2c0UklNT1orRUZkNnFyUjkwTDhqRzdXQmt0ZHZ1bUl6V2R1dklYSnhiWFJPdHNyZTlMOGo0VnRCRnBGWVNIRkFGOUVXRlZobDlibVRHd0pUN0JMaWtwczd4UlgrTTY0MGNGaVBZazczZDh1eDR3bTJETVdrMWlyY2tQZTIifQ%3D%3D\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Land</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this update went into effect on May 4th, 2020, and is one of the largest the internet has seen in a while. Core updates, as opposed to daily updates, tend to happen every few months and are not meant to be a method of restricting or limiting web traffic to certain pages. However, it can be challenging to completely map out what the changes are with the update and how they will affect your website. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It usually takes a few months before data analysts can determine the full effects of a core update. However, internal trends are usually reported within a few weeks. At this moment, Doctor Genius’ client base shows positive results for online traffic following the core update. Since the update began, </span><b>our clients have seen more than a 20%</b><b><i> increase</i></b><b> in organic page views and organic sessions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In other words, the recent uptick in our client’s online performance is likely due to Google’s May algorithm change. </span></p>\r\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How This May Effect Your Practice</span></i></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/08/core-updates.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Webmaster Central Blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> explains that the core update involves changes that “are about improving how our systems assess content overall,” further stating that “These changes may cause some pages that were previously under-rewarded to do better.” However, it can also cause certain pages to not receive as much traffic. In these instances, it helps to have a team that can further assess the situation and adapt to any changes.</span></p>\r\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You Can Do to Stay Ahead of Algorithm Changes</span></i></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to staying ahead of these Google algorithm changes, there are several possible steps one can take. The main area of focus should always be on the quality of content. While keywords can help certain pages rank in search results, the algorithm continues to change to better track spam or other pages that do not deliver quality content. Semrush.com quotes Google in saying that these </span><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/google-may-2020-core-update/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">core updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are “designed to ensure that overall, we’re delivering on our mission to present relevant and authoritative content to searchers.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can help create original content for your website with the purpose to both express the message you want to send and help target patient needs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our marketing and production teams are constantly reviewing content and help send the right message for each client. As we anticipate Google’s algorithm to constantly be updated to reward quality content, we work proactively to update our client’s pages with the information on the latest technology and answers to the new consumer needs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also work to improve on how we structure content to meet the needs of more users’ queries. In congruence with what experts say about SEO best practices, we constantly provide client&#8217;s new material because Google’s search values unique content. All of our efforts also adhere to the quality factors stated in Google’s Central Webmaster Blog:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing original information</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Containing a complete and comprehensive description of the topic</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring the title or headline of pages is descriptive of the topic</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the proper resources and citations</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping deliver a personalized and unique message</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Groups Who Were Most Affected by Search </span></i></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the major questions people have with each update is who benefits from this and who is taking a hit in the number of page views. Semrush.com explains that “the most influenced categories are Travel, Real Estate, Health, Pets &amp; Animals, and People &amp; Society.” Commonly known as the winners and losers of the update, it seems that websites focusing on news, business and industrial, online communication, and health experienced their own levels of increase in views.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semrush.com further explains that the entertainment websites promoting offline entertainment took the biggest hit and are on the losing side of the update. Since more people are remaining inside and most businesses have restrictions, it can be difficult to offer specific services. Medical practices are also experiencing limitations due to quarantine. However, an outcome of Covid-19 has been google favoring medical providers who offer virtual consultations. Additionally, we have personally seen an uptick in demand for dental services during the first months of the pandemic, as mentioned in our </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blueprint to recovery</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can help to adapt and tailor the content of your website to reflect both your practice services and the content that will attract more views. Especially following the COVID-19 pandemic and the quarantine regulations across the world, it is crucial for medical practices to have an effective online platform for reaching potential and current patients. For a website to help do this, there needs to be a regular flow of content to display activity.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach Patients with Your Message</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will take the time to understand your needs and desire for how you want to present your website to patients.

These changes are focused on helping enhance how Google measures the content of a page to determine where it ends up in search results lists. This update can have a positive or negative effect on search results for certain types of services and fields in the market.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>How Often Does Google Release Core Updates? </b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, the update can be every few months. The last update was in January of 2020. This update seems to be the largest update in a while as sources determine that it took around two weeks to finish updating.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>What is E-A-T? </b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-A-T stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. This acronym applies to page quality for webpages, blogs, and articles posted online. This acronym covers the three areas of focus for determining if the content will meet the guidelines of the algorithm update. Doctor Genius can help clients to stay on top of these updates.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>What is the Difference Between a Google Core Update and Regular Updates?</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Google Core Updates only happen several times a year, there are much smaller updates and tweaks at least once per day. These routine updates can affect ranking but tend to only have a marginal effect on search results.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Although remote work<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/the-new-normal-how-to-keep-your-teams-engaged-and-motivated/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>To protect employees from the outbreak of COVID-19, many companies have asked their staff to work from home. Although remote work is already somewhat common in many industries, many companies were not ready for the unexpected transition into an entirely remote workforce.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping work teams engaged and motivated</h2>\r\n<p>It is not enough to have the proper tech tools to keep the remote team working, but leadership also needs a strategy for maintaining efficient and motivated teams. Almost all families are now quarantined together in their houses, so employees have to deal with more distractions than usual. Also, they may be anxious about their safety and wellbeing, so employers need to pay attention to how their fears may affect productivity in the following weeks and months. To ensure smooth operations as the company navigates the “new normal,” below are expert insights on how to maintain engagement and motivation as the team works from home:</p>\r\n<h3>Communication is important</h3>\r\n<p>A fully remote team needs regular, clear communication to succeed. It is particularly crucial as the COVID-19 situation unfolds. Business owners need to devise different methods to communicate with their employees, including emails and chat software. Carefully prepared presentations can keep them going and provide necessary updates that affect the business at large. Chat channels are an efficient way to handle communication that once took place ad hoc, while video software can take the place of formal meetings.</p>\r\n<h3>Videos work too</h3>\r\n<p>Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts are easy-to-use video conferencing tools that ensure a regular meeting schedule. The key is to encourage every team member to switch on their cameras for face-to-face and necessary social interaction. Weekly meetings over video conferencing can keep everyone connected and prepared for work.</p>\r\n<h3>Exemplary leadership with proper remote work setup</h3>\r\n<p>If the team is not familiar with working from home, they may need time to adjust to their new home workspace. As the leader, having a proper remote work setup can serve as the model for the team, especially during video conferences. The work setup should be free of clutters and face a window for natural light. Noise-canceling headphones can help maintain focus on the necessary tasks.</p>\r\n<h3>Avoid micromanaging</h3>\r\n<p>Leaders might be tempted to monitor their employees constantly to ensure that they are staying on task as they work from home. However, micromanaging the team does not inspire trust, and a culture that revolves around trust is essential when keeping remote workers engaged and motivated. Since most of the work is now done remotely, leaders can achieve trust by avoiding micromanagement and staying transparent. Workers should be able to work autonomously.</p>\r\n<h3>Friendly interactions</h3>\r\n<p>Time often passes by quickly at home, and employees, removed from the social cues in the office, might be working without breaks. Managers can plan virtual breaks with team members between meetings to praise their accomplishments and foster healthy casual talk. Studies show, workers often perform better when they have a leader who cares about their wellbeing and creates time for fun and teambuilding.</p>\r\n<h2>Final note</h2>\r\n<p>These are challenging times, and employees are still trying to adjust to the COVID-19 crisis and their work. You can do your best as the business owner or manager to keep them motivated and engaged during the new normal.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

An optimistic mindset would suit you better, though. Research shows that having a positive mindset helps strengthen your immune system, your body&#8217;s first line of defense against the COVID-19 virus.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping a positive mindset during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Studies have shown that <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html\">stress sources, like tension at work or marital spats, can promote diseases and hinder recovery</a>. Here are simple things you can do to keep your stress levels at a minimum during these uncertain times:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Establishing a work-life balance</h3>\r\n<p>Having a good balance between the time you spend working and the time spent doing things that refresh you (like spending time with family) is one of those things that most busy people struggle with, particularly business owners. With most of the country under some form of quarantine. People now have more time to spend with their loved ones and improve their relationships.</p>\r\n<p>It is best to be proactive about your work-life balance. Plan our your daily schedule ahead of time and include activities with the family, like helping the kids with their remote learning. While people cannot wait for this pandemic to be over with, they can use this time to establish a work-life balance.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Lower your operating costs</h3>\r\n<p>Business owners have to adapt to COVID-19 by taking advantage of tools like video phone conferencing, since meeting face to face is currently not an option for many. The good thing is that it will reduce your operating costs and can show you new ways to make your business more efficient.</p>\r\n<p>Growing and sustaining a business remotely is a huge challenge, but many business owners are doing exactly that. It will also save you money in the long run.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Capitalize on new opportunities</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 is causing disruptions to our lives in ways we have never seen before. Time-tested systems that have been used for manufacturing, studying, working, and living are being destroyed all around us. Without a doubt, some businesses will be forced to close, but it also creates massive opportunities in many industries.</p>\r\n<p>The world is now trying to figure out better ways to learn, work, live, and run businesses. Those who come up with solutions to the problems created by the coronavirus will have success. For example, some dental clinics are now using video conferencing tools to diagnose patients, educate them on how to deal with their issues, and determine if they need to come to the clinic for emergency dental work.</p>\r\n<h2>Don&#8217;t stress over problems created by COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Instead, find solutions to these problems, and your business will emerge better than it was before the pandemic started.</p>\r\n<p><em>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

With this in mind, dental practices are wondering how to proceed in a post-COVID-19 world. Our team at Doctor Genius is here to help practices go over what they will need to help reach patients and go over the new process for dental treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Now, more than ever, it is crucial for practices to send out the right message to patients. Doctor Genius can help.</p>\r\n<h3>Following the Latest State Mandates and Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>Since each state has different mandates for dental practices and quarantine regulations, it is essential for dental practices to remain on top of it. The <a href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/covid-19-state-mandates-and-recommendations?utm_source=cpsorg&amp;utm_medium=covid-cps-virus-lp&amp;utm_content=state-mandates&amp;utm_campaign=covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ADA Center for Professional Success&#x2122;</a> is keeping track of each state and what is allowed when it comes to dental services.</p>\r\n<p>Since each state is unique, there are a variety of changes and steps that dental practices will need to take. Along with that, we can help go over how to express these changes to patients in a positive way. We can offer you support during these challenging times, which will still have an impact on society well after the quarantine is lifted.</p>\r\n<p>This only increases the notion that practices need to have a plan for re-opening. A recent Doctor Genius Webinar covers the details about developing a plan for dental practices known as the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius-1.wistia.com/medias/5yv90rvx3c\" target=\" _blank\">Practice Recovery Blueprint</a>. Along with helping to set up a plan, we can help you capture the message your practice sends to patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Building Your Message to Patients</h3>\r\n<p>While having an active website with constantly updating content relevant to your practice is important, there are new questions that patients will have in a post-COVID-19 world. These questions can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n\t<li>What are the new hours?</li>\r\n\t<li>Can I schedule an appointment this week?</li>\r\n\t<li>What constitutes a dental emergency?</li>\r\n\t<li>Should I try to put my tooth back in if it falls out?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do I need to wear a facemask in the lobby?</li>\r\n\t<li>If my child is receiving dental care, can I wait in the lobby?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are only a few of the possible questions patients may have. At Doctor Genius, we understand this is a stressful time for dentists and patients alike. Thus, it is the perfect time to talk with us about developing a message and content to reach out to your community. Patients will be looking for advice on scheduling, sudden oral health issues, oral hygiene, and follow-up care. We can help provide content that uses SEO keywords pertaining to your practice along with any guidelines or information you need patients to know.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius will strive to help equip you with the tools, content, and platform necessary to become a source of information for the current and potential patients within your community. We have the right content to help your patients understand when, where, and how to reach you with changes in everything.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge.
