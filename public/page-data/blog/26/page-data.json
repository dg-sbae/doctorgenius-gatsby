It has altered the way many practices can reach their patients and pushed states to adopt new safety guidelines. While managing your business from home, it&#8217;s essential to know which mediums are still accessible to reach your clientele. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With more people at home, more web searches are happening than before lockdowns went into effect. Many of the businesses that will thrive during this downturn will be the ones who invest in search engine marketing (SEO). While other businesses go dark, an increase in web presence can make you a more prominent voice of authority for organic search. This is especially pertinent for practices vying for local ranking. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Importance of search engine marketing during COVID-19</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Here are four reasons that you should step up your SEO campaigns during this global pandemic:</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">1. SEO brings in customers who are ready to spend</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Having cash flow can be the difference-maker that helps a business survive during tough times. SEO campaigns generate a better return on investment than other marketing techniques. Unlike more general marketing, which may target people by region, search has the power to link a searcher&#8217;s need to their desired service. As </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/on-site-seo-factors/295357/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Search Engine Journal Points out</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, consistent posting, allowing more services online, and designing a user-friendly website will help your online business space overcome changes to Google&#8217;s algorithm. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Since businesses have to operate differently due to COVID-19, Google now permits virtual consultations as a </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/9798848?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GMB listing for telehealth</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> providers.

Scarcity leads to more online searches</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">An increased number of people staying at home means that there will be more people online searching for the things they need. Household items that were once easy to find have virtually disappeared from store shelves. Ranking search terms for any of these hard-to-find products, like toilet paper and hand sanitizer, is a traffic gold mine.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Businesses can also take advantage of the scarcity by ranking for alternatives to these products. This will also lead to a significant increase in traffic during these uncertain times.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3. Search engine traffic can be measured and tracked</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is little guesswork involved when running SEO campaigns. A business&#8217;s analytics gives them detailed information about their users, their behaviors, and the keywords that brought them to their website. It allows owners and managers to tweak their search engine marketing efforts as needed and increase their ROI. Search engine metrics can also help identify poor copy that does not convert. When times are hard, businesses should focus on marketing efforts that can be easily tracked and adjusted.

Things will eventually get back to normal</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While COVID-19 has caused panic globally, it is unlikely to change the way the world works significantly. SEO marketing will continue to be an effective way to reach customers, and businesses that increased their traffic by adapting to the changes the pandemic caused will be better positioned when things get back to normal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even though paid SEO campaigns can lead to positive results in a short amount of time, ranking for hot keywords in your industry takes time. Prime your business to be a winner by getting ahead of your search engine marketing needs and using SEO to generate additional revenue during this pandemic.

Now more than ever, medical practices need to find an effective way to reach patients in homes that will need treatment. It is possible to start rebounding now so your practice will be stronger than ever.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some tips to position your practice as a local leader during and after the pandemic.</p>\r\n<h2>Three ways to thrive during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Even when the pandemic reaches its peak, there will be a need for local practices. Local practices are the backbone of communities and can thrive by adapting to the new normal. This includes embracing technology and increasing the commitment to health standards.</p>\r\n<p>Practices also need to connect with clients via social media and online. Offices that do these three things can be industry leaders well before the pandemic is under control.</p>\r\n<h3>Embrace technology</h3>\r\n<p>Right now, big tech is in the position to come out ahead when the coronavirus pandemic comes to an end. With most Americans engaged in strict social distancing, people are more reliant on technology than ever before. While big tech might take the lead, businesses of all types can rebound by embracing technology. This will help businesses today and well after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>\r\n<p>The medical community is already doing this. Physicians now see large numbers of patients via video chat and phone calls. Even dentists have joined in, using teledentistry to evaluate patients and give second opinions. Businesses that use technology will rebound during the COVID-19 crisis and be on solid footing when it ends.</p>\r\n<h3>Show a commitment to health standards</h3>\r\n<p>People are afraid right now, and that fear will not disappear after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Businesses can start rebounding now by reaching out to clients and telling them what they are doing to prevent the spread of the disease. Also, these businesses should explain that these standards are not just in place for the pandemic. The health of patients is always a priority.</p>\r\n<h3>Stay connected with social media</h3>\r\n<p>Brands like Instacart and Dial have increased social media spend during COVID-19, and that makes sense. Both brands appeal to consumers during this crisis. Still, all businesses can benefit from being active on social media during this time. People spend more time online right now, and social media marketing is a good way to reach customers.</p>\r\n<p>Many people turn to local practices for information regarding COVID-19. Dentists, physicians, and others can use social media to get messages out to the public at large. This can include information about the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve. Doctors and dentists can also use the channel to help people take preventative measures for their physical and oral health.</p>\r\n<p>These practices can also help lighten the mood on social media. With so much frightening information, funny memes can help followers relax. The key is to find the sweet spot between informative and entertaining posts. Practices do not want to make the mistake of always providing humor when followers also need guidance.</p>\r\n<h2>Start rebounding today</h2>\r\n<p>With a vaccine for COVID-19 months away, you cannot wait until the pandemic is over to get to work. If you wait too long, you will have a hard time rebounding. Between technology, a commitment to health, and an online presence, you will stay on people’s minds during this crisis. You can continue to see patients and build loyalty that will last well beyond the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As knowledge about the virus evolves, and as cases of affected patients continue to rise, community responses and government regulations also evolve to help practices safely manage patients&#8217; health, protect their staff&#8217;s safety, and remain financially solvent. Below are several of these new laws and protocols that likely affect your medical practice, plus recommended and required steps to take.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though current at the time of writing, these regulations and guidelines are subject to change, so be sure to verify with official sources.</span></p>\r\n<h2><b>OSHA Regulations and New Protocols</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of its efforts to protect workers from on-the-job hazards, the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration (OSHA) issued interim guidance for specific worker groups and their employers, with</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html#healthcare\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> specific instructions to health care employers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. OSHA&#8217;s infection prevention recommendations include engineering controls (such as the use of physical barriers between patients and staff), administrative controls (such as isolating patients and minimizing staff present for procedures), and safe work practices (like avoiding unnecessary touching of surfaces) to help protect workers from COVID-19 exposure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers of health care workers remain responsible for following applicable OSHA requirements. Workplaces such as dental offices and medical practices with occupational exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials, including saliva in dental procedures, must comply with OSHA&#8217;s</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bloodborne Pathogens</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> standards. These standards include the practice of universal safety precautions.

Specifically, OSHA has issued</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> temporary enforcement guidance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> related to the executive order making general use respirators available to health care personnel during the COVID-19 emergency.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Personal Protective Equipment</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers must provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to staff to limit their potential exposure to infectious hazards. Workers who must use PPE must be trained on when to use it, what equipment is necessary, how to put on and take off PPE to prevent self-contamination, how to dispose of or disinfect PPE properly, how to maintain PPE, and limitations of the PPE safely. Applicable standards include </span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.133\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eye and Face Protection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.138\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hand Protection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.138\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Respiratory Protection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recommended PPE for health care personnel who interact with patients or could be exposed to contaminated materials include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolation gowns</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nitrile exam gloves</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified, disposable N95 or better respirators</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eye and face protection, such as goggles and face shield</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given supply chain shortages of PPE across the country, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) updated its </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommendations to allow facemasks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an acceptable alternative to N95 respirators, with respirators prioritized for use in procedures more likely to generate respiratory aerosols. Practices should preserve their inventory of PPE as much as reasonably possible. In case of shortage, PPE protocols may require modification to allow the reuse of equipment or allow alternatives that do not meet the standards.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Required Training</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers also are responsible for training workers about:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources of occupational exposure to the virus</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appropriate workplace protocols to prevent or reduce exposure</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to isolate people with suspected COVID-19</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to report possible cases to public health authorities</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All training must be provided during scheduled work times for free to the employee.

For example, the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) mandates certain employers follow the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/OHB/Pages/ATDStd.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aerosol Transmissible Diseases (ATD)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> standard.

The U.S. Department of Labor&#8217;s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) administers and enforces the requirements.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Emergency Sick Leave</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered employers who are not electing an exception (see below) must provide any employee two weeks (up to 80 hours for full-time employees) of emergency paid sick leave in certain circumstances, detailed below. This sick leave is available to all employees, regardless of their length of employment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency sick leave must be paid at the worker&#8217;s regular rate of pay if the employee cannot work because:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The employee is quarantined on the advice of a health care provider</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The employee is under a federal, state, or local government isolation order</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The employee is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that the amount paid is subject to </span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-questions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aggregate caps</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Sick leave for one of the above reasons is limited to a maximum benefit payment of $511 per day, or $5,110 total over the entire emergency paid sick leave time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the employee cannot work because of a need to care for someone subject to quarantine (pursuant to government order or health care provider advice) or to care for a child under 18 years of age whose school or child care provider is closed for COVID-19 related reasons, then the employee is eligible for up to 80 hours (two weeks) of emergency paid sick leave paid at two-thirds the employee&#8217;s regular rate of pay. In these circumstances, the sick leave benefit pays a maximum of $200 per day or $2,000 over the entire two week period.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that the employee cannot take emergency paid sick leave both for themselves and to care for another; the total hours of emergency paid sick leave cannot exceed 80 hours. Also, note that you cannot require an employee to first exhaust other paid leave. You must grant emergency sick leave in addition to any pre-existing leave benefits.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Emergency FMLA</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered employers must provide employees that have been employed for at least 30 days with up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave when an employee cannot work. The reason for the employee&#8217;s absence must be a need to care for a child under 18 years of age whose school or child care provider is closed for reasons related to COVID-19. Employees are to be paid two-thirds of their regular rate of pay for the hours they would have been scheduled to work during that period. The maximum pay is $200 per day, or $12,000 in the aggregate if the employee takes two weeks of paid emergency sick leave followed by 10 weeks of emergency leave.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Exceptions</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers with less than 50 employees or who are health care providers under the FFCRA&#8217;s definition may provide FFCRA paid leave to their employees, or they may elect for an exemption to the requirements. According to the regulations, an employer might need to rely on the exemption if it determines that:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing paid sick leave or expanded FMLA would cause the business to cease operating at a minimal capacity because expenses would exceed revenue</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The absence of the employee requesting paid sick leave or expanded FMLA would pose a substantial risk to the finances or operational capabilities of the business because of the employee&#8217;s specialized skills or responsibilities</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are not sufficient workers able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or services of the employee requesting paid sick leave or expanded FMLA, and the labor or services are needed to operate at minimal capacity</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Tax Credits</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered employers qualify for </span><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/covid-19-related-tax-credits-for-required-paid-leave-provided-by-small-and-midsize-businesses-faqs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tax credits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that provide dollar-for-dollar reimbursement for all qualifying emergency paid sick leave or expanded FMLA wages paid under the FFCRA, up to the aggregate payment caps. The fully refundable tax credits also include the employer&#8217;s share of Medicare tax for those wages and the cost of maintaining health insurance coverage for the employee during the sick leave period. The employer is not subject to the employer portion of social security tax imposed on those wages. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers claim the credits on their federal employment tax returns, but they can benefit more quickly by reducing their federal employment tax deposits. If there are not enough federal employment taxes to cover the amount of the credits, employers may request an advance payment of the credits from the IRS by submitting a </span><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-7200\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post the required FFCRA notice according to the</span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-poster-questions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> notice posting requirements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The notice must be in clearly visible locations and sent to remote staff. To obtain notices free of charge, contact the WHD at 1-866-4-USWAGE (1-866-487-9243), or download and</span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/posters/FFCRA_Poster_WH1422_Non-Federal.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> print the notice</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> yourself from</span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determine whether your practice will require the use of the exemption to FFCRA.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to policies around requiring symptomatic or at-risk employees to stay home, create policies regarding emergency sick leave, and expanded FMLA.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your practice will not be taking exception to FFCRA and intends to obtain tax credits, thoroughly document the staff absences and leaves taken for COVID-19 related reasons, including specific details such as the names and ages of children, the name of the closed school or child care provider, etc.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retain a copy of Form 941, Employer&#8217;s Quarterly Federal Tax Return.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Local and State Sick and Family Leave</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several cities and states have enacted their own emergency sick leave and paid family leave requirements to expand protections beyond the federal programs. For example, </span><a href=\"https://sfgov.org/olse/san-francisco-paid-sick-leave-coronavirus\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco issued new guidance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that requires covered employers in the city to let employees use accrued sick leave for several COVID-19 related reasons. San Francisco also created the </span><a href=\"https://sfmayor.org/article/mayor-breed-announces-plan-provide-paid-sick-leave-workers-impacted-coronavirus\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workers and Families First Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to offer financial incentives for businesses to provide an additional five days of sick leave pay.  </span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consult your city government, state labor agencies, and benefits providers to find out whether you have additional employment laws to follow for sick leave or family leave.</span></p>\r\n<h2><b>Restrictions on Different Practice Types</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) issued &#8220;</span><a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-non-emergent-elective-medical-recommendations.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Emergent, Elective Medical Services, and Treatment Recommendations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; to guide practices in determining what health care they should postpone during the COVID-19 crisis. Many state governments, state medical boards, and local jurisdictions have issued restrictions on different practices and different procedures. The intent of the restrictions is to help prevent the spread of the virus by limiting potential contact with infected persons, preserve the availability of health care personnel to care for patients affected by COVID-19, ration use of limited supplies of PPE, and save additional hospital space to care for infected patients. Generally, all licensed health care providers should postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately necessary to prevent serious adverse medical consequences or death.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many states have issued orders specific to specialty. For example, in California, the Department of Public Health issued &#8220;</span><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/GuidanceforDentistry.aspx#\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 Guidance for Dentistry</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&#8221; The directive:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advises dentists to postpone all routine, cosmetic, and non-emergency care indefinitely</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Requires dentists be available to their patients of record for emergency care</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instructs dentists to screen each patient to be sure they are asymptomatic and have not been exposed to someone with COVID-19</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Details protocols for treating patients for emergency dental issues</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review any federal, state, professional, or CDC directives applicable to your specialty and your location.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postpone any elective or cosmetic surgeries, as well as non-emergency procedures.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoroughly document any decisions to proceed with treatment or delay scheduled procedures and surgeries.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Develop guidelines for allowable office visits.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow up-to-date guidance on</span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-laws-what-workplaces-need-to-do-if-an-employee-or-patient-gets-the-covid-19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> treating patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Special Considerations for Contract Staff</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Independent contractors are not employees. They are not eligible for emergency sick leave or expanded FMLA under the FFCRA, and you cannot claim tax credits. However, there are a few financial assistance resources possibly available to contract staff.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, eligibility criteria are expanded to include people not typically eligible for unemployment insurance. The CARES Act provides for</span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20200402-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for independent contractors and self-employed individuals who have lost employment or have reduced hours of work as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contract staff (and your practice) might qualify for a $10,000</span><a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/economic-injury-disaster-loan-emergency-advance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through the Small Business Administration, as well as the</span><a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program-ppp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Paycheck Protection Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs, enacted through the CARES Act, provide temporary, immediate relief for small businesses, self-employed individuals, and independent contractors. The funds are intended to pay for payroll expenses, as well as some operating expenses like rent and utilities.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special note to California practices or practices that use California-based workers: With legislation effective January 1, 2020, classification of workers as independent contractors narrowed significantly. While</span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Assembly Bill No. 5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (AB5) exempts physicians and dentists, nurses, physician&#8217;s assistants, behavioral health providers, medical transcriptionists, and more are subject to the law. By default, everyone not exempted is considered an employee; businesses bear the burden of ensuring an individual fulfills the criteria of the so-called ABC test for independent contractors.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a worker you treated as an independent contractor attempts to file for standard unemployment insurance, the state Employment Development Department (EDD) likely will audit your working relationship to determine whether the classification was correct. The EDD could determine the individual should have been classified as a W2 wage employee. In that case, you will be liable for the back payment of employment taxes.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review</span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/financing-options-now-available-resulting-from-covid-19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> available resources for financial assistance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, if needed.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If in California, review the potential impact of the AB5 legislation on your classification of workers as independent contractors.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Stay-at-home Orders and Social Distancing Protocols</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No federal stay-at-home order has been issued, though the White House recommends the country follow social distancing measures. However, up to 97 percent of the United States population is subject to state and/or local stay-at-home orders. Nearly all stay-at-home orders include exceptions related to essential activities and purposes, including health care. Most stay-at-home orders do not consider elective medical procedures and surgeries to be essential, and as such, prohibit them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though physicians&#8217; offices, dental practices, and other health care providers generally are considered essential businesses, many city, county, or state jurisdictions have imposed mandatory social distancing protocols. For example, Eagle County, Colorado, requires essential businesses that remain open to create and visibly post a </span><a href=\"https://www.eaglecounty.us/PublicHealth/Documents/Appendix-A-Social-Distancing-Protocol_FINAL/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Distancing Protocol</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that explains how the business plans to meet social distancing, sanitizing, and cleaning requirements. Employers must give every employee working on-site a copy of the protocol, and businesses must follow the protocol. Similarly, several counties in California now require dental offices, ambulatory clinics, and more to complete the </span><a href=\"https://www.cda.org/Portals/0/pdfs/COVID-19_Pdfs/Appendix-A-Social-Distancing-Protocol.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Distancing Protocol PDF form</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the form must be given to employees, posted near the facility&#8217;s entrance, and be available to any enforcing authority upon request.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>Actions to Take:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review any local order to stay-at-home, and confirm your practice does not perform any prohibited activities.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delay all non-urgent patient care.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establish and follow the required and recommended social distancing protocols whenever possible.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make adjustments to the workplace and to protocols to allow staff more physical distance from each other and from the public.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider allowing staff to complete certain tasks remotely, provided that appropriate security measures will be in place to fulfill HIPAA-related privacy requirements.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider implementing telehealth technologies to continue to serve patients remotely via virtual visits.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Key Takeaways</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regularly</span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> check the CDC for updated guidance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on safety precautions.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay current on</span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> OSHA guidelines and interim enforcement orders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding workplace safety requirements and recommendations.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check with national and state chapters of professional organizations, such as the American Dental Association, for practice-specific guidance.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comply with current and updated labor law requirements from </span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Department of Labor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow more specific local and state orders for public health.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explore options available for financial assistance.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establish communication channels with staff and patients and clearly communicate information about your practice&#8217;s protocols and policies for handling their health and safety during the COVID-19 emergency.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, our team works to help inform practices and provide guidance on operational decisions for your practice&#8217;s best interests. </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/contact\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact us</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with questions and to learn more about what we can do for you in this crisis.</span></p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

If<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/dental-teams-front-line-commitments/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>COVID-19 is affecting all health care providers, including dentists. As the pandemic rages on, dentists are on the frontlines. If you are a dentist, you are likely to continue conducting emergency procedures at your office. Also, you might find yourself helping at the local hospital. Find out more about the frontline commitments dental teams are facing.</p>\r\n<h2>Dental emergencies and COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Every 14 seconds, <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/Science%20and%20Research/HPI/Files/HPIgraphic_0819_1.pdf?la=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">someone visits a hospital or emergency room for a dental condition</a>, according to the American Dental Association. Dentists and physicians urge patients to go to dental offices instead. Going to dental offices takes the burden off hospitals. Also, dental patients will lower the risk of exposure by avoiding emergency rooms.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, the question then becomes how to know if a dentist is open during quarantine? The American Dental Association has created guidelines for dental emergencies. Patients should reach out to a dental office immediately if they experience one of these emergencies.</p>\r\n<h3>Bleeding or swelling</h3>\r\n<p>Bleeding or swelling in or around the mouth is a dental emergency. Gum infection, trauma, malnutrition, or pregnancy could cause mouth bleeding or swelling. After treating the problem, the patient should feel more comfortable. Also, fast treatment prevents infection from spreading. An infection can be dangerous, so patients should visit the dentist immediately. Failure to do so could lead to a more serious medical issue.</p>\r\n<h3>Tooth or jaw pain</h3>\r\n<p>Pain is a sign that something is wrong with the teeth or jaws. Pain could be caused by a cavity or infection, among other things. Unfortunately, untreated pain often continues to get worse. Patients who have pain should seek treatment quickly before it becomes unmanageable. The dentist can alleviate the pain and treat the condition.</p>\r\n<p>Investing in store-bought medication to relieve pain will only provide temporary relief. A dentist can help patients receive the lasting relief they need.</p>\r\n<h3>Broken or knocked-out teeth</h3>\r\n<p>Patients who have broken or knocked-out teeth need immediate care, even during the COVID-19 crisis. The dentist might be able to save the teeth. If not, the dentist can restore the teeth if needed. Failure to seek treatment will allow the teeth to shift. This could lead to bone loss and other oral problems.</p>\r\n<h3>Post-op care</h3>\r\n<p>Those who underwent dental surgery might want to put off post-operative care. Stitch removal and dressing changes are critical. Dentists still want patients to come in for these services. Offices are taking special precautions during the pandemic. These precautions limit the spread of the virus.</p>\r\n<h3>Dentists in hospitals</h3>\r\n<p>Dentists are also working on the frontlines in hospitals. Some dentists help other frontline workers by donating PPE equipment to fight COVID-19. Others are volunteering at local hospitals. For example, California is asking dentists to volunteer. More dentists will likely be needed in hospitals as the pandemic gets closer to the peak in the following months.</p>\r\n<h2>Providing valuable services during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created an all-hands-on-deck situation.

If you<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-set-up-virtual-visits-with-patients/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Setting up virtual visits can be the solution you need to continue seeing patients during the COVID-19 crisis. If you are using telemedicine for the first time, you likely have a few questions. Find out how Doctor Genius can help you set up virtual visits by contacting us at (877) 477-2311.</p>\r\n<p>To help you understand the importance of telemedicine, we will go through the steps for getting started. Below are a few tips on scheduling virtual appointments while we get through this pandemic together.</p>\r\n<h2>Using telemedicine during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Right now, the federal government has relaxed rules regarding HIPAA compliance and telemedicine. Still, providers are encouraged to choose a HIPAA-compliant vendor. First, providers can check with their current EHR vendor to see if it has telemedicine functionality.</p>\r\n<p>For our clients, we now offer a TeleDentistry service. If you work in the dental space, contact our office to discuss setting up this service for your practice. Doctor Genius&#8217; option works as an extension to your site&#8217;s interface, allowing patients to connect directly from your website to you.  </p>\r\n<h3>Get the proper technology</h3>\r\n<p>Once practices select software, it is time to consider equipment. Providers need a high-quality webcam and microphone to offer the service. Most computers have both, but many providers choose to purchase standalone equipment. The right equipment improves the quality of video appointments.</p>\r\n<p>Providers also need a fast internet connection. At a minimum, 5 Mbps upload and 15 Mbps download speeds are required. Providers should check the internet speed by running a speed test. It is easy to conduct a speed test online. Those who use Wi-Fi can speed up the connection by plugging the internet directly into the computer through an ethernet cable.</p>\r\n<h3>Choose a dedicated space</h3>\r\n<p>Patients want virtual visits to mimic in-person visits. That means they expect to have the provider’s full attention during telemedicine appointments. Providers should set up a dedicated space for these visits. After selecting a space for the appointments, providers should check the lighting, ensuring that it is bright but does not cause any glare. It is also wise to check for echoes and noise when selecting a room for these visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Test the equipment</h3>\r\n<p>Providers should not conduct telemedicine visits until they test the equipment. Testing is as simple as having a video chat with another provider. The provider can check the sound and video quality, paying special attention to latency. If the video takes time to buffer, it will be difficult to conduct a telemedicine appointment.</p>\r\n<h3>Inform the patient of technical needs</h3>\r\n<p>Many patients have yet to undergo a telemedicine appointment. Providers should explain what is necessary for these appointments, including access to video chat. Ask the patients to sit in a quiet, private room during the appointment. Some will prefer scheduling appointments when no one else is home, so providers should mention that.</p>\r\n<h3>Contact the patient</h3>\r\n<p>After scheduling a telemedicine appointment, the provider needs to contact the patient with a link. This can be done through an online portal or via text message if the patient has opted in to receive SMS messages. The patient is directed to a virtual waiting room after clicking on the link. Then, when the provider is ready, the appointment begins.</p>\r\n<h2>Get started with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Telemedicine makes it much easier for providers to see patients during this health crisis. If you have yet to use this, consider adding telemedicine software. By providing your patients with this option, you can continue to see your patients during this difficult time. This will allow you to limit your in-person visits while still caring for your patients.</p>\r\n<p>With quarantine continuing to be in effect throughout the country, telemedicine and other techniques like it are becoming the solution that medical practices need to continue providing professional care.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most. Digital marketing can help your practice adapt and grow in the aftermath of COVID-19.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Are Here to Help </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unsure if your dental practice is ready for the digital landscape, we can help.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
