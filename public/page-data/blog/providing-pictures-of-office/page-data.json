Relying on the same generic pictures that everyone else in your industry is using can reflect poorly on your company. By focusing on appealing to more users with unique, eye-catching photos, you have a better chance at ranking higher on search engines and improving your overall SEO. Learn how to take your digital marketing efforts a step further by including pictures of your office on your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Knowing when to use stock or original photos</h2>\r\n<p>While using unique imagery throughout your company website would be ideal for most effectively branding your company, it is not always practical to include an original photograph every time you need an image on a page. If you&#8217;re using a mix of stock and personal photos on your site, it is important you know when it is acceptable to use stock photos and when you should use a photographer.</p>\r\n<h3>When to use stock photos</h3>\r\n<p>Stock photos can easily be found online and may be free or sold for a low price, depending on the site you use. Some of these photos are very high-quality, effective photographs and can be used for your ads and campaigns in situations where you need to save money and get the image out right away. While these photos may be professional quality, most people can tell the image came from a stock image site, so use these sparingly. </p>\r\n<h3>When to use original photos</h3>\r\n<p>Original photos are images that you produce in-house by either taking your own pictures or hiring a professional photographer. Using your own pictures is most essential when you are trying to create a personal connection with your patients and show them the faces behind your company. By including pictures of staff members and using real photos of your office throughout the website, your potential patients get to know you better and are more likely to choose to use your services with you as a result.</p>\r\n<h2>Making your images SEO friendly</h2>\r\n<p>While it is almost always better to use your own images on your site, you still need to pay attention to how they are being used to have the best ranking. For the best SEO results, keep the following tips in mind:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Use images on every page, including with every blog post</li>\r\n\t<li>Place images near the text it applies to</li>\r\n\t<li>Give the photo a unique name that matches the subject matter</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduce the file size by compressing it without compromising quality</li>\r\n\t<li>Consider the format of the photo and how you plan to use it</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure your images are compatible with mobile devices</li>\r\n\t<li>Resize the image to the appropriate size</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Make the biggest impact on future patients</h2>\r\n<p>Patients choose medical providers they can trust, which is why using original photos that let your patients get to know you better is so beneficial.

Blogging has transformed from a niche hobby to an essential marketing strategy that companies successfully use to engage current consumers and draw in new traffic. However, simply creating a blog is not enough. Developing an effective and beneficial blog requires constant management, SEO tactics, new content, and adaptations to current trends.</p>\r\n<h2>Key steps to increase blog credibility</h2>\r\n<p>With so much bad information only a click away, more and more consumers are searching for sites that have been proven to be trustworthy and credible. Consumers want to know that a blog is offering dependable content with fresh ideas regularly (that are, of course, entertaining and appealing to read). Here are key steps to focus on to build credibility and reach more viewers.  </p>\r\n<h3>Post regularly</h3>\r\n<p>Blogging regularly is a must if you want to stay in your industry’s top contenders. Consumers constantly crave new content, and generating professional, helpful blog posts on a regularly maintained schedule is one of the easiest ways to develop a trusting relationship with them. The more reliable content a blog produces, the faster it will build an audience — a crucial step for many businesses trying to get off the ground. Many consumers have a sharp eye for a live site, and it is usually obvious when a site has not been updated recently, which can bring reliability into question. Posting regularly also helps build a site’s <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-eat-misconceptions/333875/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-eat-misconceptions/333875/\">E-A-T</a>, or Expertise, Authority, and Trust, which is a tool Google uses to identify and promote proven trustworthy blogs.</p>\r\n<h3>Use hyperlinks and backlinks</h3>\r\n<p>Hyperlinks create a hidden web of connectivity within the blogging world. By hyperlinking information in one post to another creator’s content, you are building connections with that creator. Hyperlinking can also develop your site’s credibility, so long as you are using <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/\">reliable sources</a>. On the other hand, backlinks are also beneficial in connecting other sites to your own, and they can help your site perform better in search engine results.</p>\r\n<h3>Include keywords</h3>\r\n<p>In brief, search engine optimization is a practice that broadens a site’s audience by bringing new consumers to it naturally through a search engine. When a consumer types certain keywords into Google, the top results contain those words. This is why incorporating keywords into each post is crucial. Your post, and therefore your website, is more likely to be discovered if it includes occasional keywords that might get entered into a search engine. Using them in the content, taglines, and tags of a post will make it easier for consumers to find.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about building a successful blog</h2>\r\n<p>There are many other detailed ways to gain more credibility for your business through successful blogging.

While neural matching has not replaced the previous algorithms used to generate Google search results, it does play a role in how the latest Google core update ranks webpages.</p>\r\n<h2>Neural matching</h2>\r\n<p>Google has always been somewhat secretive about how its search algorithms work. Additionally, the company does not use every algorithm it has developed and does not usually disclose which algorithms are in use at any one time. The reasoning is that if Google revealed exactly how the algorithms work, it would be easy for users to exploit them to artificially boost their pages to the top of the search results. </p>\r\n<h3>What neural matching is</h3>\r\n<p>Neural matching is part of the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">most recent update</a> to Google&#8217;s search algorithm. It utilizes artificial intelligence to make search results more diverse. The use of AI technology makes it easier for the Google search engine to analyze language and interpret the intent of search queries. This allows Google to match a webpage to a query based solely on the text of the webpage. </p>\r\n<p>One way the neural matching algorithm is expected to improve the search engine&#8217;s ability to interpret queries is by making it better at recognizing when people search for a term that means the same thing as a keyword on a webpage. It is estimated that this algorithm will affect about 30% of user queries.</p>\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/\">research paper released by Google</a>, the algorithm may use document relevance ranking to determine the best search results while avoiding spam and irrelevant results. In other words, this algorithm could help the search engine figure out which results are the best and rank those the highest while pushing pages that try to game the system or have little relevance to the query lower in the rankings. </p>\r\n<h3>How neural matching affects search engine optimization</h3>\r\n<p>The core concept of neural matching is to reward content creators for effectively answering the questions posed by users in queries and de-emphasize the role of links and keywords. However, this does not mean that Google has completely abandoned the traditional ranking criteria used by the core algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>Rather, it is believed that the traditional criteria are applied first to thin the herd by removing spam and irrelevant pages from the results. Then, the new algorithm is used to re-rank the remaining results, so that the most useful results receive the top rankings. Doctor Genius can help content creators improve page rankings by creating content that is useful to users while also establishing the basic credibility and relevance of the content by attracting high-quality backlinks and including relevant keywords.</p>\r\n<h2>Optimize your SEO</h2>\r\n<p>The implementation of neural matching has not radically changed how Google rankings work. However, it could impact how your pages rank. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact Doctor Genius today</a> to find out how we can help you optimize your pages to make the most of this new neural matching algorithm. </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
