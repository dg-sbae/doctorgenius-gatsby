However, the financial impact<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/why-practices-should-turn-to-digital-marketing-to-survive-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>COVID-19 has had an impact on most industries in the United States, as well as globally. However, the financial impact of the pandemic can be limited through a more refined marketing approach. The daily life of prospective patients has temporarily changed, and they are spending more time online and using digital devices more often. As the way patients operate daily has changed, the marketing strategies of practices should also adapt. </p>\r\n<p>Many healthcare and dental practices are turning toward online marketing strategies to weather the storm during COVID-19, and the effort to focus on digital marketing may lead to an increase in long-term revenue and more resilience if a future pandemic occurs.</p>\r\n<h2>Limit the COVID-19 impact on patient acquisition</h2>\r\n<p>Offline marketing strategies that many practices rely upon are simply not effective during the pandemic. Billboard ads are not being seen often, as our nation pushes for a strong effort of social distancing and staying home. Word-of-mouth patient acquisitions are also dissipating, with public gatherings and workplaces canceling until further notice, which limits social interactions.</p>\r\n<p>Digital marketing, however, is far less affected by COVID-19 as <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/31/americans-turn-to-technology-during-covid-19-outbreak-say-an-outage-would-be-a-problem/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/31/americans-turn-to-technology-during-covid-19-outbreak-say-an-outage-would-be-a-problem/\">the use of digital devices increases</a>. There are many ways that practices can strengthen their online presence during the COVID-19 crisis. Notably, cleaning up and improving your practice’s website, increasing content production to reach more prospective patients, and utilizing targeted digital advertisements can all be effective during these trying times. </p>\r\n<h3>Digital marketing can have a long-lasting impact</h3>\r\n<p>Many practices and businesses alike are increasing efforts in digital marketing to make it through the pandemic, as the benefits may lead to long-term gain. Digital marketing is a reliable strategy for patient acquisition that does not only have to be utilized during times of crisis. Some practices that only did just enough in the past to get by with their online presence are now turning toward digital marketing as a way to increase revenue. Establishing a solid digital marketing platform can make businesses stronger for years to come by providing them with another reliable channel for patient acquisition. </p>\r\n<h3>Protect your practice from any future pandemics</h3>\r\n<p>While ideally, we will not see another pandemic for more than a century, the reality is that businesses must prepare for unpredictable scenarios. From natural disasters to public health crises, many unforeseen events can occur. Practices that properly prepare by broadening their outreach are often more resilient. The potential to grow your business through an increase in the patient acquisition, along with the ability to reduce the negative financial impact when people are forced to travel less, enhances the ability of a practice to make it through the other side stronger than ever. </p>\r\n<h2>Find out more about digital marketing strategies</h2>\r\n<p>The temporary effects of COVID-19 put practices in a unique and undesirable situation. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Those who grow their digital marketing efforts during these trying times can be in a better position to weather the storm and become stronger than ever when the dust settles.

Whether some practices continue to provide some emergency services during the quarantine or had to close their doors, there are various factors that they will need to know before reopening fully. Thus Doctor Genius is working with NextLevel Practice CEO Gary Kadi to introduce the Practice Recovery Blueprint.</p>\r\n<h3>The Solution You Need in One Place</h3>\r\n<p>As we enter the third month in quarantine, state governments are laying out plans to allow more businesses to reopen with modest new operational guidelines. Professional medical practices of all professions are attempting to determine the next steps for reopening. In a recent webinar session in the series &#8220;Certainty in an Uncertain World,&#8221; Doctor Genius&#8217;s Vice President Phil Lopez and Gary Kadi, join others in breaking down what the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius-1.wistia.com/medias/5yv90rvx3c\" target=\" _blank\">Practice Recovery Blueprint</a> includes for medical professionals and why it is so important.</p>\r\n<p>During the appointment, Phil Lopez and Gary Kadi, list off questions and factors that dentists and other medical professionals need to focus on. Lopez elaborates on the partnership with NextLevel Practice to create &#8220;…an all-inclusive solution that meets the needs of your practice,&#8221; also highlighting that &#8220;Our partnership provides the resources that improve your organization&#8217;s operations and empower teams to create a one-of-a-kind experience for patients.&#8221; This partnership can help our clients determine what they will need to reopen and provide the quality services patients need.</p>\r\n<h3>Following the Search Results</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we are constantly monitoring the search results of our content to determine what services patients are searching for. While there was a dip in search results during the earlier weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now seeing an increase in specific search terms.</p>\r\n<p>The actual change in organic traffic growth for dental practices since stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns, went into effect is represented in the graph below. Organic traffic growth is defined as the growth of visitors who found a website through search inquires alone. As can be seen from the graph below, the number of searches by users is growing each week. When we cross-compared these numbers to yearly averages for late March and all of April for other years, we found this growth in visitors to be atypical. In other words, the data is showing that patients have a growing demand to seek out dentists during the COVID-19 crisis. Numerically, there are about 7% more patients visiting dental sites each week from organic search.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2140\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3.png\" alt=\"Growth in Organic Traffic Since Lockdown for Dental\" width=\"549\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3.png 549w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3-300x166.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3-177x98.png 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" /></p>\r\n<p>Common search terms we see include &#8220;dentist near me,&#8221; &#8220;emergency dentist,&#8221; &#8220;teledentistry,&#8221; and other questions such as &#8220;Can you put a tooth back in your mouth?,&#8221; &#8220;Is a tooth abscess considered a dental emergency?,&#8221; or &#8220;What do you do with a toothache on the weekends?&#8221; to name a few. People are currently in need of treatment and will be once the quarantine lifts. While at this moment, most online inquires show spikes in emergency care needs, we’re also seeing new searches. To prepare for what searches may be relevant going into June and beyond, you may read further into <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/\">our article on changing habits</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Dental practices need to be prepared to provide all of the services patients need. Many of the practices we serve are reporting an increase in customer activity as patients want to put this stall in their work-lives toward staying healthy. Visit <a href=\"https://recoverygenius.nextlevelpractice.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Practice Recovery Blueprint</a> to learn more about how to prepare and reopen with a strong foot forward.</p>\r\n<h3>Starting with The Right Blueprints</h3>\r\n<p>When it comes to providing dentistry in a post-COVID world, dentists will need to consider various factors for providing treatment. Doctor Genius and NextLevel Practice can help dentists find the solutions they need by considering several factors such as:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n\t<li>Implementing new sanitation measures for office staff, guests in the waiting room, and the dental chair</li>\r\n\t<li>Frequency of scheduling appointments</li>\r\n\t<li>Language and message front desk staff members use when communicating with patients over the phone</li>\r\n\t<li>Anticipating specific services online that patients need</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Given how quickly regulations and stay-at-home orders can change under quarantine, Doctor Genius is here to help with short term fixes for sudden issues, which can lead to long term solutions. We will customize the plan to an individual practice&#8217;s needs with relevant content, teledentistry services (to be announced), and specific return-to-work plans.

Whether you are providing emergency services or are<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/good-office-sanitation-practices/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Preventing the spread of COVID-19 is critical for medical and dental offices. Whether you are providing emergency services or are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, sanitation should be a top priority. Due to the highly contagious nature of this virus, you need to take extra steps to keep germs at bay. Along with keeping your office clean, these sanitation practices will also help your patients relax when they visit your office.</p>\r\n<h2>How to keep offices clean during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Offices must start by gathering the proper cleaning supplies. That includes supplies for the people doing the cleaning, as well as any supplies the office team needs. Those who take on the cleaning duties should use a mask, gown, and gloves to protect themselves from the virus. These items should be thrown away after cleaning.</p>\r\n<p>Cleaning supplies include a soap and water solution or detergent. Offices should also use EPA-approved disinfectant to remove the virus from surfaces. Commercial disinfectants can help to clean both porous and nonporous surfaces. Employees must follow the instructions on the disinfectant to optimize the results.</p>\r\n<h3>Clean nonporous surfaces</h3>\r\n<p>After putting on the necessary PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), staff members should use a soap and water solution or detergent to clean nonporous surfaces. This removes COVID-19 particles when present, making the disinfectant more effective. After cleaning the surfaces, staff members should use a disinfectant. Then, the team needs to remove the equipment before employees wash their hands for a minimum of 20 seconds.</p>\r\n<h3>Clean often-forgotten places</h3>\r\n<p>While most offices do a good job of cleaning the obvious spots, many employees forget certain germ-prone areas. If left alone, these spots could become a breeding ground for germs. Fortunately, this is avoided by adding often-forgotten items to the daily cleaning list. Employees must clean:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Phones</li>\r\n\t<li>Doorknobs</li>\r\n\t<li>Printers and copy machines</li>\r\n\t<li>Walls</li>\r\n\t<li>Picture frames</li>\r\n\t<li>Toilet flushers</li>\r\n\t<li>Light switches</li>\r\n\t<li>Floor baseboards</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Depending on how often these items are touched, they might need to be cleaned several times a day or once a day. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people cannot overclean the office. Employers should consider a cleaning schedule for employees to follow. Also, employees should clean any items that have been touched.</p>\r\n<h3>Keep hand sanitizers available for public use</h3>\r\n<p>Sanitation goes beyond cleaning and disinfecting the office. Employers should keep hand sanitizers throughout the office for public use, including a sanitizer by the reception desk and the seating area. Sanitizers should also be in treatment rooms for patients to use.</p>\r\n<h3>Use masks when social distancing is not possible</h3>\r\n<p>Regardless of how clean an office is, it is still possible to spread COVID-19. Social distancing measures require that people stay at least six feet apart, but that is not always possible in a medical or dental office. Staff should use masks when social distancing is impossible. This will protect patients who encounter the staff.</p>\r\n<h2>Create a sanitation plan to fight COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 spreads quickly, and good sanitation is one of the top ways to fight it. While you cannot completely prevent the spread of COVID-19, you can do your part by keeping your office sanitized. Also, make sure your employees and patients have access to hand sanitizer and PPE if needed. This is a stressful time for many providers, but sanitizing your office is a good way to protect yourself, your staff, and your patients.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
