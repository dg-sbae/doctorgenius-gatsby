Most people prefer pictures that describe the story or advertise the product. If a webpage was going to describe the process for dental implants, people will wonder what a dental implant looks like and how it looks in the mouth. Instead of the individual going to Google for answers and leaving the website, give the individual what he or she wants by including informative images on the webpage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Giving your practice a face</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Images on a website can accomplish a variety of tasks with even only a few pictures, including images of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Your location</li>\r\n \t<li>The head medical professional</li>\r\n \t<li>The team members at the location</li>\r\n \t<li>Various tools and rooms of the facility</li>\r\n \t<li>The map view of practice from Google Maps</li>\r\n \t<li>Your logo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Images can put a face to the practice that act as trust signals for potential patients. For instance, an individual is less likely to consider a practice with no image of the medical professional in charge and only text that states the professional’s background. It is also important to take a few quality photos of the team members, outside of the facility and rooms within the facility as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These images can help people get a clear picture of the location they are considering for professional medical care. It is also beneficial to break up the text on other pages of the website with images showing various services or actual patients rather than stock photography. By utilizing quality content with images that promote a happier response from potential patients, you can increase the chance of people spending more time on your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Buzzsumo states that in 2015, Facebook posts with images saw more than double the amount of engagement than those posts without images.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keeping a strong presence on social media</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1060\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Even with the above statistic, text is still important and people still read. However, people surfing social media will spend less time reading a long post about dental hygiene or another medical service if there is no image. In many cases, people will scroll right by the post without even noticing. Thus, it is important to include images or video in social media posts to promote your practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Buzzsumo also adds that in 2015, articles with an image once every 75 to 100 words, received double the number of social shares than articles with fewer images. While this statistic may change in the following years, it is important to note that images only work in the proper location. Without knowledge on where to place them, people may misuse images or oversaturate a webpage with too many images and not enough content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand the crucial locations to place images and how to use them to help promote a website online.

While this may not seem like something that could heavily impact your website, there are three main ranking factors that Google relies on, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Links</li>\r\n \t<li>Content</li>\r\n \t<li>RankBrain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>RankBrain is a machine-learning AI, which means that it can acquire knowledge by building on what it already knows and from what one teaches to it. In other words, RankBrain will ignore websites with low-quality content in search results. This will only make it more difficult for people to find your website in search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>It is crucial to have a team who understand how this update works and how to implement quality content that helps potential patients find your website and remain on the website pages longer than other websites. The bounce rate is the rate at which people view a webpage and leave it, “bounce,” for another page. In fact, lower bounce rate as a byproduct of high-quality content.

This is where Doctor Genius comes in.</p>\r\n<h3>Connecting patients to doctors</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, our main goal is to help you expand your practice through online marketing. We can help healthcare practitioners expand their patient base, boost brand awareness and help doctors build trustworthy connections with patients that serve as a ladder to sustainable practice growth. To help attract and retain new patients at your practice, we utilize the effectiveness of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Digital media</li>\r\n\t<li>Social marketing</li>\r\n\t<li>Online reviews</li>\r\n\t<li>Quality referrals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can monitor all of this through an online portal that displays the factors of your growth and website activity. Our team has the skills and expertise to utilize these tools and help your practice display in Google searches. We understand how to utilize website text and marketing to help your practice be near the top of Google results lists when a patient searches for services within your medical field.</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">To help summarize our services and overall goal, here is a video about Doctor Genius.</blockquote>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cgXsqix8tE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h3>An effective website across multiple devices</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that people use different devices of varying sizes from smart-phone screens to desktop computers. The PEW Research Center finds that as of January 2017, nearly 77 percent of Americans own a smartphone and that around 9 in 10 Americans are regularly online. With this in mind, most people will probably use smartphones, tablets or laptops to conduct any form of web searches. Thus, you need a website that will properly display on any device and provide equal ease of use across all platforms for patients.</p>\r\n<p>No one likes visiting a website on a smartphone or tablet, only to have the website cut off pages or become difficult to find the navigation bar. At Doctor Genius, we create mobile-first websites that will render properly on any device. This way, when a patient uses your website, they will be able to easily view and navigate your services no matter the device.</p>\r\n<p>Another benefit of working with Doctor Genius is that we have an in-house support team available every day to help answer any questions, fix any issues and address any concerns you may have.

People may<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/home-part-iv-effective-calls-action/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>An effective call-to-action can be the final push that a potential patient needs to seek a specific service. People may recall TV commercials from childhood ending with, “Buy now,” or “get one while supplies last.” While these examples can be effective for certain products, medical practices may need a slightly different approach. People will usually spend more time contemplating where to go for any form of medical care than buying a new movie or clothes at a store.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Up front and center</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For a medical practice, the call-to-action is a crucial step that needs to utilize both specific text and a button/window to capture the attention of a potential patient. For instance, if there is an option to “Schedule an appointment today,” then there needs to be a button or window that the individual can interact with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interaction is key since it promotes direct contact with the practice through the online portal or by calling the practice over the phone. The call-to-action can also help users navigate to other pages on the website from the home page. For instance, having the call-to-action button, “Click Here to Read More” can increase the chance of the individual navigating from the home page to that page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calls-to-action help create a home page that entices users to seek the practice’s professional service. It is important to have a clear call-to-action on the website home page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Be clear and concise</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Curatti.com states that 70 percent of small business websites do not have clear calls-to-action on their homepage.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The call-to-action on a home page needs to be clear in order to improve conversion rate. The conversion rate for a website is the rate of website users who become patients. In order to increase the conversion rate, it is important to have a clear call-to-action that highlights the specific type of care at the practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presenting the call-to-action in the first person to address the user will also help. Another step in creating an effective call-to-action is to include easy-to-access contact information. By structuring a home page to display the call-to-action in an easy-to-read place, the user will be more likely to interact with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we can customize the home page to not only highlight specific services but also present calls to action in such a way that the patient will be more likely to interact with the website.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most. Digital marketing can help your practice adapt and grow in the aftermath of COVID-19.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Are Here to Help </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unsure if your dental practice is ready for the digital landscape, we can help.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
