In a world where many consumers and clients rely on<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Building a practice website for search engine optimization is important. In a world where many consumers and clients rely on what they read on the internet, having a page that ranks highly in search returns can make or break the traffic through your practice. When a potential client takes a look at your site, you want to be sure that you have created the kind of content marketing that keeps them reading and, even better, has them calling to make an appointment. One page you may want to consider incorporating is one that answers frequently asked questions. Since there are almost always general and common questions, getting them out of the way up front may improve the user&#8217;s impression of your practice immediately.</p>\r\n<h2>Reasons FAQ pages may help elevate your practice</h2>\r\n<p>Your main objective on your practice web page is to get potential clients interested in your business. You want to entice them with colorful pictures, engaging blog content, and convincing reasons why they should choose you. The FAQ page offers another opportunity to peak reader interest, and according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/02/12/making-seo-a-game-changer-for-your-business/#698e6b2e26c4\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/02/12/making-seo-a-game-changer-for-your-business/#698e6b2e26c4\">Forbes.com</a>, maximize SEO to elevate your practice&#8217;s web presence.</p>\r\n<h3>Establishes trust</h3>\r\n<p>Some medical issues may prove more difficult for clients to talk about than others. The FAQ section is the place where you can place sensitive and perhaps embarrassing client questions. As readers cycle through your site, give them the most uncomfortable queries relevant to your practice, and answer them in simple terms. This not only establishes you as an authority but as a practice that makes people feel at ease.</p>\r\n<h3>Informs clients</h3>\r\n<p>You should have information about your practice plastered all over your site. Including some <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-presenting-content-in-more-than-one-form/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-presenting-content-in-more-than-one-form/\">facts and figures in the FAQ section</a> can go a long way with potential clients. Doing it here can serve a couple of purposes. It gives information to those who want to read about it. You also can control how insight into your practice is presented and what you choose to provide.</p>\r\n<h3>Allows interaction</h3>\r\n<p>Establishing a page that does not allow readers to interact with you may turn some people away. If set up correctly, the FAQ page can allow you to field questions from readers and add them to the list you have already compiled. Answering comments or questions shows potential clients that you are attentive and care enough to address further queries. </p>\r\n<h3>Captures searches</h3>\r\n<p>Frequently asked questions contain common SEO keywords. When a person starts looking for these terms, your FAQ page may come back in the search. When this happens, it gives your website more visibility and may even net you a new client. Ensuring that your entire site is SEO friendly can work to drive more business to your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>We have solutions</h2>\r\n<p>Our team of pros at Doctor Genius is dedicated to working diligently towards getting your practice&#8217;s website optimized for maximum traction.

Writing great, engaging content is not enough to pull in a wider audience. Your website needs to consistently top the results page on Google and other search engines to catch customers who randomly search for a product you offer — after all, most people are likely to click on just the first five results. Identifying keywords that will boost your website rank is a good start, but it is not all you can do. Understanding how to analyze data about rankings and pageviews can help you strengthen weak points across the site.</p>\r\n<h2>Taking full advantage of analytics</h2>\r\n<p>Learning how to read and assess the data from your analytics software can help you develop new content marketing strategies that improve your site’s search engine optimization. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/01/02/nine-things-to-know-about-google-analytics/#1083137f6cb9\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/01/02/nine-things-to-know-about-google-analytics/#1083137f6cb9\">Google Analytics</a> and other comparable software guide you to identify keywords that your target audience searches for, discover your most popular pages, and help you generate more beneficial leads. Here are steps for getting the most out of your search analytics.    </p>\r\n<h3>Search for organic landing pages</h3>\r\n<p>One of the greatest advantages of using analytic software is that you can search for organic landing pages. These are the pages of your website that people visit the most frequently simply by typing in a search word or phrase into an engine without being brought there by advertisements. Discovering your most popular landing pages are essential because it tells you what your audience enjoys and finds interesting on your site. You can then create links on your popular pages to other related content, which builds a great internal linking system that also helps your site rate better on Google overall.  </p>\r\n<h3>Measure the quality of visitors</h3>\r\n<p>The number of site visitors and length of pageviews are quantitative data that are easy to measure, but how do you measure the quality of those who see your site? You can judge quality by determining how many people end up on your website because of organic SEO. Furthermore, an organic search that results in leads (customers who give you contact information, like an email signup) is more valuable than an organic search that does not. Use this data to see how it stands up to different marketing campaigns that you implement through advertisements or social media.</p>\r\n<h3>Update popular pages</h3>\r\n<p>On any software, it is simple to see what pages are your top performers. Make it a habit to regularly check how pages are performing and where improvements can be made. If a page has significantly lost organic traffic, use active marketing tactics for it (like pay-per-click ads). Some pages may only need an <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\">update in content</a>, while others might require a change in keywords. Look carefully at what links attract the most clicks to other content on your site. Constantly analyzing and refining your content layout and information can optimize the most popular pages so that you receive more pageviews and more business.</p>\r\n<h3>Identify searches that lead to your site</h3>\r\n<p>A fantastic element of your analytical toolbox is the ability to see what visitors searched for before clicking on your website. It is considerably easier to determine keywords to include in your content when you can view each customer’s search terms. The overall list of search words can be overwhelming, so filter it down by matching keywords to corresponding pages and focus on the pages that have a greater chance of rating higher in the results list. By placing emphasis on the right keywords and most successful pages, you can increase your online ranking.</p>\r\n<h3>Assess campaigns on other sites</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to tracking the stats on your own site, you can also track ad campaigns that you have on third-party websites. You can place email and promotional campaigns in a single list to see how they compare to one another. Use the list to clearly see the campaigns that generate the greatest traffic to your site and the content that attracts your main target audience.</p>\r\n<h2>Software for analyzing your ranking</h2>\r\n<p>Google Analytics is a popular software for a reason: It is reliable, comprehensive, and highly detailed — but that should not keep you from trying other software too. Knowing what your options are can help you decide what is right for your business. Some companies prefer to monitor SEO and organic pageviews through multiple analytic programs to understand exactly where improvements can be made. Here are alternative options if you are exploring new avenues.</p>\r\n<h3>GoSquared</h3>\r\n<p>This software is great for those who want to add a little extra to the regular analytics software. Companies can improve relationships with customers with GoSquared’s live chat option. You can also research customer browsing histories to investigate keywords and topics that led them to your site.</p>\r\n<h3>Matomo</h3>\r\n<p>If you are changing over to Matomo from Google Analytics, you do not need to worry about losing valuable data that is stored in Google. Matomo allows you to transfer old data into it to continue current analysis. This is also a good option for businesses looking to ensure security, as you can use it on your private server (the cloud is available too).</p>\r\n<h3>FoxMetrics</h3>\r\n<p>If you want to get a better handle on customer information, like the kinds of keywords that are searched for to find your page, consider FoxMetrics. This tool stores all of your data in a single bank for quick access and new reports, making it easy to research the keywords that drive the most traffic to your site.</p>\r\n<h3>Woopra</h3>\r\n<p>Woopra is all about instant response and service with a support team that is available to help with marketing and sales. The team can even respond to messages or new leads as soon as they happen in real time on your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn how to improve your online ranking</h2>\r\n<p>There is no doubt that all analytical tools come with a steep learning curve with information and data that might be difficult to discern right away.

The internet has made it easier than ever for consumers to find providers beyond their local regions and to consult with physicians states or even countries away. While this ease of access is great for individuals, it creates a highly competitive landscape for health care providers, as you may well know. As a result, you as a provider should continually look for opportunities to optimize your site not just for search, but for local search. While SEO content is one of the strongest ways to do this, structured data — or “schema markup” — can put you well ahead of the competition.  </p>\r\n<h2>Understanding structured data</h2>\r\n<p>Structured data markup helps define information in such a way that the search bots can better understand the context of your page, delivering “rich snippets.” HTML, on the other hand, simply tells the bots how to display text included in a tag.</p>\r\n<p>Neil Patel explains the <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.\">ins and outs of schema markup</a>. In a nutshell, schema markup can help you create a virtual business card. While non-marked-up results pull from title tags and meta descriptions to return generic information about your practice, marked-up results can show users everything from your practice’s name to its ratings to its hours, all right there in the SERPs. Before rich snippets were introduced, this kind of data — numbers, ratings, etc. — were not understood by the search bots and, therefore, ignored.</p>\r\n<h2>Using structured data to reach local patients</h2>\r\n<p>The most obvious way structured data can help you reach and attract local patients is by helping Google read items such as your map and phone number so it can include that information in the SERPs. While your content probably mentions your city and state several times for SEO purposes, schema markup makes it possible to show potential patients exactly where you are located, down to the suite number.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, location is just one factor patients consider before selecting a provider. Patients also want to find a provider who is in the right field, who offers their insurance, and who has stellar patient reviews. Unlike HTML tags, which offer you limited space to tell searchers what your practice is about, structured data lets you <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0\">describe a page in as detailed a manner as possible</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For example, in the “@type” section, you can describe the type of content your page promises. In the “@description” section, you can include what you do (“A cosmetic dentist with 15 years of perfecting smiles.”) and/or a list of insurance your practice accepts. The “aggregate rating” section lets you input your best and worst ratings, and Google will deliver the average. All of the information you choose to put in your markup can help local searchers make the most informed decisions possible without them ever having to click through to your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Create meaningful results</h2>\r\n<p>From <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">writing for skimmers</a> to writing for the search bots, our team at Doctor Genius is familiar with the strongest tactics for attracting new patients and ranking well in the search engines.
