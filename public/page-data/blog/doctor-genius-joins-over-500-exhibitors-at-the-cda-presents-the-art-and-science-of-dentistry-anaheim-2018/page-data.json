In an online market with multiple products available, there are numerous situations in which professionals invest in an online tool and are unsure of how to truly utilize it. For instance, having a tool that identifies effective keywords is only effective when someone knows how to apply those results to the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, Doctor Genius has the knowledge necessary to utilize specific online tools to help get your professional website more traffic. This 5-part blog series summarizes a few of the tools that we employ in our packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>SEO Keywords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic function of a professional website is to advertise a service or group of services in order to reach consumers. The effective method for keeping people on a website is to provide content covering services or related topics. However, there are thousands of resources online that can appear higher up on a Google search over our clients. Thus, we insert SEO keywords into text that will help the website appear higher up the search list.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Call Tracking</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For many private medical practices, having a working phone number is an important part of the appointment process. No matter how much information is on a website, there is always a need for patients to call the office. However, professionals do not keep track of all phone calls and what source generated them. A call tracking system can measure which ads or web pages are bringing in the greatest amount of traffic. This way, we can shift focus from one aspect to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb6-2-blog.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1126\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb6-2-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb6-2-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb6-2-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">The Pew Research Center states that at least 77 percent of U.S. adults own a smartphone.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overloading a Website with Content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is important to have content on a website, simply flooding a website with content or copying more content onto a website will cause issues instead of benefits. Along with that is the fact that content needs to include topics and keywords that can help boost Google search list rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile First vs. Mobile Responsive</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A mobile first website is when we create the mobile version of a website so that it appears on a phone screen without causing other issues. After creating the website for phones and tablets, we will then create the website for the desktop, as well. This way, you can have a website that appears properly on all devices without cutting off page content or causing other issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
