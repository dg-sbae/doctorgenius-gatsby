There are many areas this type of lawyer can help with in addition to litigation, and having a trusted lawyer before you need one can eliminate the stress associated with having to scramble to locate one on short notice.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to find a trusted professional dental lawyer</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to confidential matters and issues that could have a tremendous impact on your practice, the <a href=\"https://ebusiness.ada.org/assets/docs/6850.PDF?OrderID=2104406\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://ebusiness.ada.org/assets/docs/6850.PDF?OrderID=2104406\">American Dental Association</a> recommends choosing your lawyer carefully. Here are methods to use when deciding on a lawyer for your dental practice. </p>\r\n<h3>Consult online resources</h3>\r\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of using a search engine like Google as you begin your query is the ability to see reviews from previous clients. Although some opinions may be a bit extreme, reviews can typically provide a general overview of how professional and successful a lawyer has been in the past. </p>\r\n<h3>Take advantage of your network</h3>\r\n<p>Odds are good you know someone at another practice who has used a dental lawyer before, a friend or relative who is a lawyer in this area, or experience with dental law. Be bold about asking peers for a referral. People are not likely to recommend someone to you unless they know that person will do a good job. </p>\r\n<h3>Use a lawyer referral service</h3>\r\n<p>Many state and local bar associations often have a lawyer referral service. The lawyers these services refer people to are generally well known and respected in their communities and have a proven track record of success. If this is the route you choose to go, it is more about picking the lawyer who is the right fit for your practice than having to decide whether the lawyer is competent. </p>\r\n<h3>Ask your malpractice carrier</h3>\r\n<p>Because all operating medical practices should have a malpractice carrier, this option is relatively simple. You should already have a representative and a phone number or email address handy. Contact your malpractice representative and ask about respected lawyers who have handled cases similar to yours. </p>\r\n<h3>Talk to your state dental association</h3>\r\n<p>Some state dental associations have approved referral lists of law firms and attorneys. Because these lists typically include lawyers from all over the state, it is important to be aware of the location of the lawyers you are most interested in. If you need legal advice in a specialized area, make sure to ask what kind of experience the lawyer has in that area specifically. </p>\r\n<h2>Turn to us for help</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you need a dental lawyer, assistance with <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\">medical marketing</a>, or ideas on how to improve patient retention, Doctor Genius has you covered.

In today&#8217;s world where many potential<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/advice-for-dealing-with-negative-yelp-and-google-reviews/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>You work hard to build a successful medical practice and establish an excellent reputation. In today&#8217;s world where many potential patients choose a medical practice based on the online reviews of previous patients, it is critical to know how to handle negative reviews. Learning about patient review management can help you not only deal with poor reviews but also grow your practice. </p>\r\n<h2>How reviews affect search engine rankings</h2>\r\n<p>The algorithm Google uses when someone searches for your practice pulls reviews from many platforms such as Yelp, Google, and Facebook. While one bad review on Google may not be enough to disrupt your ranking, one patient who leaves a negative review across multiple platforms can cause your ranking to fall. All it takes is a few patients with a negative perception of your practice to leave reviews on several websites, and your ranking, as well as the reputation and credibility of your practice, can suffer. Because of this, it is critical to handle poor reviews quickly and professionally. </p>\r\n<h2>Turning negative reviews into a positive patient experience</h2>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/03/bad-reviews-can-boost-sales-heres-why\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/03/bad-reviews-can-boost-sales-heres-why\">Harvard Business Review</a>, bad reviews can actually be good for business when handled correctly. Here is how this can be accomplished. </p>\r\n<h3>Respond to the review in a timely manner</h3>\r\n<p>Ignoring a negative review is the worst thing you can do. Silence only reinforces the patient&#8217;s perception that you and your practice do not care about them. However, it is equally important to plan your response carefully and understand the patient&#8217;s situation before responding. </p>\r\n<h3>Properly assess the situation</h3>\r\n<p>Taking the time to figure out what went wrong can not only allow you to respond appropriately but also help you prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Ask questions of your staff about what was said or done that perhaps could have been misinterpreted. If there is any recorded correspondence, such as phone calls, voice mails, or emails, listen to or read through those to better understand what happened. </p>\r\n<h3>Make the situation right</h3>\r\n<p>When a bad review is handled correctly, it shows your dedication to patient experience and care. It can be reassuring for potential patients to understand that if there are any incidents during an appointment or procedure, they will be taken seriously and dealt with correctly. </p>\r\n<h3>Express your gratitude to the customer</h3>\r\n<p>Every unhappy patient is an opportunity to make your practice better. Many times, patients who have a poor experience never take the time to leave a review. Rather, they will avoid your practice or speak poorly of it to others. By leaving a review, the patient gives you the chance to make things right and earn back their trust. Saying thank you to a patient is a wonderful way to bring closure to a potentially disruptive situation.</p>\r\n<h2>Improve your online presence </h2>\r\n<p>With an increasing number of people looking at online reviews and top-ranked business listings, strategic SEO for medical practices can have a tremendous impact on your practice. Our trained team members at Doctor Genius are here to help you improve not only your Google <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/\">ranking</a> but also your social media presence, website maintenance, and more.

Knowing exactly<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/understanding-your-brand/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When it comes to having a successful marketing strategy, understanding your medical practice brand is a critical component. Knowing exactly who you are and what you are about as a practice can be a key element to creating and communicating a strong brand presence and increasing your appeal to potential patients. </p>\r\n<h2>Know what makes your practice unique</h2>\r\n<p>There is a reason why you decided to run your own practice. Considering this can help you better understand what defines your brand. The &#8220;why&#8221; behind your process can make your practice more appealing to patients. </p>\r\n<h3>Identify your personality</h3>\r\n<p>Figuring out your personality and company culture as a practice can make it more relatable to your target patients. Do you have an older staff, play soft music, and keep many plants around the office? This personality could be more suited to senior generations. Decisions about office staff and ambiance should not be arbitrary but part of your strategy to communicate your brand and gain patient loyalty. </p>\r\n<h3>Define your voice</h3>\r\n<p>Every practice has a brand voice, whether it is intentionally or unintentionally conveyed. Everything from the demeanor of your staff to the language used on your website sets the tone for your patients&#8217; experience. Is your voice encouraging and empowering? Informative and friendly? Professional and ambitious? Knowing how you want to be perceived by your patients can help you determine which voice to use and be purposeful in expressing it.</p>\r\n<h3>Create a visual identity</h3>\r\n<p>In conjunction with language, the way your office and website look can have a tremendous impact on your brand. Do they have a modern, edgy appearance or a classic, comfortable feel? Everything from the color of the paint and the pictures on the walls to the layout of your webpage communicates the brand of your practice. Tailoring the design of your office and website to appeal to your target patients can help entice them to visit your office as well as make them feel comfortable while there.</p>\r\n<h2>Understand the benefits of branding for patients</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15\">Forbes</a>, the right branding can help you make a lasting first impression that can both attract new clients and impress the ones you have. When you clearly communicate the type of practice you run and what makes it special, it takes that guesswork out of the equation for patients and can put them at ease about visiting your office for the first time. The more comfortable patients feel about their visit, the more likely they are to have a positive experience and become loyal patients for life. </p>\r\n<h2>Reach target patients more effectively</h2>\r\n<p>The Doctor Genius team knows gaining and retaining patients is the lifeblood of your practice. We can help you identify and clearly communicate your brand so your marketing is more effective and you can spend more time caring for your patients than you do trying to get new ones.
