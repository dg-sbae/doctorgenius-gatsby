It&#8217;s almost certain that every practice and every team is experiencing new daily or weekly challenges. Throughout these trying times, we&#8217;ve been doing everything we can to make our doctor&#8217;s lives more manageable. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re proud to discuss our new course of action that helps dentists turn things back around.</p>\r\n<p>As an organization, Doctor Genius continually audits, manages, and adjusts our online strategy to what&#8217;s applicable to the times. With so much uncertainty, it&#8217;s important to identify new areas of opportunity and, more importantly, understand where the future of dentistry is headed. Ask yourself, before the pandemic, how prevalent were telehealth services in our industry? Fast forward today, and nearly all practice owners are adopting new innovative ways to reach patients and provide quality care.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, our Doctor Genius Recovery Expert, Shawn Stiffler, has the facts and information on the preventive actions you can take to sustain your practice. With a background in finance, Shawn&#8217;s expertise shines through when dealing with Dentists who don&#8217;t have a 1000 ft view of their operations and don&#8217;t know where to go.</p>\r\n<h3>Understanding What Happened to Dental Practices During Quarantine</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n<style>\r\n    .author-panel {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-direction: row;\r\n        font-size: 1.0rem;\r\n        line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-panel.card {\r\n        padding: 2.5%;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-panel p { line-height: 1.5 !important; }\r\n    .author-panel .panel-text {font-size: 14.5px !important;  }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder {\r\n        width: 25%;\r\n        margin: 1% 2.5%\r\n    }\r\n    .image-holder img, .author-info {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        max-width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n    .image-holder img {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        height: auto;\r\n        margin-bottom: 15px;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-info h5 {\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n        font-size: 100%;\r\n        text-decoration: underline\r\n    }\r\n    .author-info ul {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        padding-left: 0;\r\n        width: 100% !important;\r\n        justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-panel ul li {\r\n        list-style-type: none;\r\n        text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-info li {\r\n        font-size: 75%;\r\n        font-style: italic;\r\n    }\r\n    .panel-text { width: 72.5%; margin-left: 2.5% }\r\n    .author-panel h5 { margin-bottom: 0)\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"author-panel card\">\r\n<div class=\"image-holder\"><img class=\"author-image\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Linkedin-Head-Shot-Shawn-Stiffler.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Stiffler\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\r\n<div class=\"author-info\">\r\n<h5>Sean Stiffler</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"Author page coming soon!\">Posts</a></li>\r\n<!--\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\">Bio</a></li>\r\n-->\r\n\t<li><a href=\"mailto:sstiffler@doctorgenius.com\">Email</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-text\">\r\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-stiffler-68947773/\">Recovery Expert, Shawn Stiffler’s</a> extensive experience in the industry has proven to help dentists take a deeper dive into their market to find areas of opportunity to increase overall practice revenue.</p>\r\n<p>For the past 5 years, Shawn and Doctor Genius have been able to turn underperforming practices into thriving businesses. But how? Taking a thorough and comprehensive analysis of industry standards, industry metrics, online presence, services offered, and the overall online strategy for your business can dramatically impact the direction your business will go.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Most recently, a study conducted by Local Med stated that, </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"padding: 0 2%;\">During quarantine, hygiene appointments weren&#8217;t happening. And that means those appointments weren&#8217;t being reappointed either. A deep dive into Dental Intelligence&#8217;s data has shown us that all across the country, hygiene chairs are less than 15% scheduled in September, October, and November.”</blockquote>\r\n<p>Just like any other area of your business, conducting a statistical analysis of your missed appointments, no shows, and gaps in scheduling are a great place to start in order to identify ways to improve and maximize the hygiene department`s productivity.</p>\r\n<h3>Why Did Appointments Dip in 2020?</h3>\r\n<p>Since March, medical <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/dont-avoid-your-doctor-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">visits have declined</a>, despite the impact doctors warn it could have on the nation’s health. Polling indicates that people are typically more fearful of going anywhere. A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/\">we looked at</a> the economic impact this is having on businesses and steps professionals can take to remain successful during a financial downturn. This is why the onus is on the dentist to schedule more appointments by reaching out to patients again.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2379\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg\" alt=\"Scheduled Hygiene Production\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-300x212.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-768x542.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-177x125.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\r\n<h3>How do we fix this?</h3>\r\n<p>By gaining more market share! We need to fill the gaps in your schedule by creating more awareness online that your practice is accepting new patients. We need to expand your online footprint and market your practice the <i>right</i> way!</p>\r\n<p>Dental Intelligence/Local Med adds that, “Normally, hygiene schedules are 80% full. But now they&#8217;re 80% empty. It&#8217;s vital to take steps now in order to be on track to see as many of your hygiene patients as possible.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>After auditing our own Doctor Genius client’s online and internal performance, we found that this was an overall trend for almost all dentists. It’s crucial to understand and correct this as soon as possible to ensure you’re maximizing each area of your dental practice in regard to consistency and improved performance over time. </p>\r\n<h3>We’re here to help!</h3>\r\n<p>Since dentists are experiencing fluctuations in scheduling hygiene appointments during the quarantine, even with rescheduling efforts, there will still be a gap of incoming patients equivalent to that gap. However, clients of Doctor Genius have an online presence and system in place to continue scheduling appointments, rescheduling appointments, and focusing on patient retention efforts.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can identify areas of opportunity to benefit a client’s practice, boost their online presence, and help increase practice sustainability during these uncertain times. With COVID-19 continuing to alter the medical landscape in numerous ways, it is crucial to have a plan that can adapt to this climate. Our team will help clients learn how to utilize their online reach to continue seeing current patients while bringing in new patients.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the process, Doctor Genius can help you know where you are, understand your gap analysis, and develop a plan for how to proceed. This can include a marketing plan for how to promote the key services you offer.</p>\r\n<p>Take your first step into discovering your local markets untapped potential <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo\">here</a><b>. </b> Contact one of our <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">support specialists</a> to get set up today.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Utilizing keywords does nothing<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When optimizing your practice&#8217;s webpage to boost its ranking in searches, keywords are only the beginning. Utilizing keywords does nothing if readers do not read your posts. You want high conversion numbers, and shorter attention spans may put even the most SEO-optimized site at risk. Learn how to create articles that readers can quickly skim to glean the highlights.</p>\r\n<h2>How ranking and content work together</h2>\r\n<p>Google uses algorithms to increase a page&#8217;s visibility during a search return. The higher your site ranks, the more likely a potential client is to click on your page. However, getting clicks is just the beginning. Your content format must also engage and appeal to your practice&#8217;s target audience. Your blog posts should be easy to read, focusing on <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/\">topics and information relevant</a> to your practice. When we at DG create content, we focus on making them topical and easy to read.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing blogs for your target audience</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/\">Time magazine</a>, the average person gives an article approximately 15 seconds before abandoning it. You have to hook potential clients in that short time. Utilizing methods designed to provide them with information in easy-to-digest chunks can help. Employing several methods in posts to increase reader engagement may translate into more appointments for your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Headings</h3>\r\n<p>A good strategy to help appeal to a skimmer is utilizing headings. As in this article, paragraph headers break up content by topics. While this alone may not be enough to convey your message to readers, it can direct the eyes to the portions of your content that appeal directly to them. For instance, if your interest lies in creating lists, you may jump to the heading entitled &#8220;Bullet Points&#8221; in this article. Headings direct readers to the information they seek.</p>\r\n<h3>Bullet points</h3>\r\n<p>As a way to further maximize skimming, integrate bullet points and lists into your posts. There are a variety of ways you can do this effectively. Try not to overuse this method as your content will wind up looking like a to-do list rather than an informative and engaging post. Some elements that lend themselves easily to bullet lists include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Symptoms and signs</li>\r\n\t<li>Frequently prescribed medications</li>\r\n\t<li>Common diagnoses</li>\r\n\t<li>Treatment options</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When readers start by reading lists, it may catch their attention and prompt them to finish the article for more insight.</p>\r\n<h3>Visual aids</h3>\r\n<p>People may gravitate to posts that contain visual content other than words. Integrating photographs, graphs, and charts into your content may capture potential clients by giving them something colorful to ponder. Visual representations of medical conditions, such as cavities, may also help readers understand what they need to watch for in themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Get help hooking clients</h2>\r\n<p>Your practice hinges on new patients, and grabbing their attention requires content that is easily digestible and informative.

Understanding what type of content to create that best suits your customers can help you develop a larger audience faster.</p>\r\n<h2>Content formats for optimizing your digital marketing strategy  </h2>\r\n<p>In this day and age, there is practically no way for a business that wants to succeed to avoid using a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/matzucker/2019/11/14/whats-in-a-digital-marketing-strategy/#29f6d7ae68b2\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/matzucker/2019/11/14/whats-in-a-digital-marketing-strategy/#29f6d7ae68b2\">digital marketing strategy</a>. Too many consumers are online and engaged in social media not to take advantage of it, but failing to know where your audience lies in the massive online community can waste any strategy, no matter how good it may seem on paper. Determining the right content format for your business is the first step in reaching the right audience. Here are some popular and useful options to consider.</p>\r\n<h3>Blog posts</h3>\r\n<p>When brainstorming ideas for your next marketing promotion, blog posts have more than likely made the list. Blogs are popular for many good reasons, as they can be incredibly successful in conveying important information to a variety of readers. There are endless types of posts that can be used to your advantage, like guides, lists, reviews, and how-to articles. However, a blog post has its limitations, and other forms of content may connect better with your audience.</p>\r\n<h3>Videos</h3>\r\n<p>There is no question why video platforms, such as YouTube, have remained successful for so many years. People of all ages watch videos for both entertainment and learning purposes. Videos are one of the easiest ways for viewers to absorb new content, which makes them an excellent resource for businesses looking to expand marketing. From ads to tutorials, you can use a video to address your audience about almost anything.</p>\r\n<h3>Research</h3>\r\n<p>Research that a business does itself and reports is more likely to get shared and viewed than research you report from someone else. Getting shares can skyrocket search engine optimization via backlinks and by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\">establishing greater credibility</a>. Conducting a survey can not only help your own business grow but may be of great interest to others in your niche.</p>\r\n<h3>Infographics</h3>\r\n<p>Infographics combine pictures and words to generate engaging content that gets to the point quickly. They are easy to follow, visually appealing, and loaded with helpful information that a reader can easily digest. The amount of time viewers spend looking at a single piece of content continues to decrease, so crafting content that gets the main points across without hassle is ideal in today’s fast-paced media.</p>\r\n<h2>Explore more content forms for marketing</h2>\r\n<p>These are only a handful of possible content formats to consider for your business. Discussing your specific clientele needs directly with a professional can help narrow down a successful marketing strategy. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for more information on content formats and to get help planning your next promotional campaign.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
