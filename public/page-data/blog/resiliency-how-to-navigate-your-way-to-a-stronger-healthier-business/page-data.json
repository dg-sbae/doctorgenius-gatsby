Fortunately, there is still hope for businesses and private practices. At Doctor Genius, we can help dentists, and other practices maximize their online presence and reach in the digital market. These steps, when done correctly, can help you chart your way toward building a strong, healthy, and resilient practice following the quarantine.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a resilient business after a pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies are creating contingency plans as precautions against COVID-19. Some are implementing or adapting existing plans, while others have to develop new plans. The following are measures that companies can take to build a stronger and healthier business.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider the effect of coronavirus on customers</h3>\r\n<p>Depending on the industry, customers might be experiencing certain difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Business owners need to think strategically about the challenges that customers are facing and what can be done to help them. Using those facts, they can create a new sales pitch and structure their marketing plans to meet those challenges and needs.</p>\r\n<p>Regular business challenges typically worsen during a crisis. Business owners have the role of restructuring their product offerings to address the specific struggles faced by their customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Adopt new sales mediums</h3>\r\n<p>Despite the total lockdown, people will need to make purchases, providing opportunities to offer your products or services through alternative sales channels. For instance, if COVID-19 is halting customer visits to the company’s store, it is time to target and expand eCommerce channels. Business owners need to review their internet marketing efforts and e-commerce sales and see how they provide a boost.</p>\r\n<p>Focus more on conversations on social media and LinkedIn over physical sales meetings. Many B2B companies, especially those who deal with software or digital services and solutions, are already in this realm. The business continues, and more of it might need to go online.</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on long-term investments</h3>\r\n<p>The coronavirus disease situation might be the cue to make long-term investments in the business, especially those in B2B sales. If there is a momentary relapse in sales, then the time is right to reevaluate operations, processes, and existing platforms and get strategic for the long term. If there are major prospects in view, now is the time to dedicate more resources and effort into managing the leads and capitalizing on longer-term opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Monitor the leads, provide reassurances, and let everyone know that there are contingency plans in place and that they can access help when needed. This unparalleled situation is undoubtedly causing many cancellations like concert tickets, airline reservations, and business conferences. Still, high-ticket B2B sales may not suffer as much, unless the crisis continues for longer than anticipated, and companies start to reduce spending and investment.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us to Learn More Today</h2>\r\n<p>Economic recovery might happen earlier than expected. If you fail to position your business strategically, however, you may not be well-placed to build on post-pandemic recovery. Companies can take salient measures now to ensure that they come out of a major crisis like COVID-19 stronger and healthier.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Along with businesses, dental practices also experience these issues, striving for a plan. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help dental and other medical practices have a plan in place for opening their practice back up after the quarantine. With our guidance and services, we can help you start things with a strong foot forward for your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Recovering after a pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>When a dental or medical practice is dealing with hard times, the best option for the owner or manager is to stay calm and evaluate every possible opportunity. The following are potential points to consider.</p>\r\n<h3>Assess the condition of the practice</h3>\r\n<p>Perform a business appraisal and decide what needs to be done urgently. It is crucial to evaluate what a dental practice has and follow current updates with the COVID-19 pandemic. As the U.S. shifts to summer, more and more restrictions will begin to loosen. With that, people will begin returning to their normal routines. Our team can help dentists evaluate what they will need to reopen effectively.</p>\r\n<p>Now is the time to get creative and deal with the situation. The result of the appraisal will provide insights on whatever needs to be adjusted to get the business running.</p>\r\n<h3>Reach out to employees and customers</h3>\r\n<p>While some practices may be open for immediate health emergencies, not every practice can do that. In many cases, practices can reach out to any scheduled patient appointments to re-schedule appointments for a few months in the future. This includes letting them know the delays they might experience with certain services or is available.</p>\r\n<p>Employees need to know if their schedules will change and the nature of work they need to do. They need to know if the practice will be restricting hours or if they will need to work remotely for some time. Our team can help go over teledentistry, what it is, and how it can help practices reach patients at home during COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h3>Reinvent the business</h3>\r\n<p>In fact, it is easier for smaller businesses to modify their business models, switch focus, and get back into the game. Our team will help evaluate how to ensure dentists can effectively reach their patients while also offering advice on how to alter their practice methods during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Pay attention to what customers might need and would buy, and direct business operations toward that. Aside from considering immediate service demands, evaluate past sales for indications of increase, decline, or stagnancy. If sales were declining or stagnant, the downtime might be the time to think about necessary changes to make when the economy gains pace once more.</p>\r\n<h3>Non-equity cash raise</h3>\r\n<p>Seek to raise money from non-equity sources. Develop strategies to get government grants. Consider the SBA initiatives in place to help small businesses. Be inventive about getting sources of cash to stay in business, including making short-term deals that relieve the current crunch.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us to Learn More</h2>\r\n<p>Like virtually everything in life, the COVID-19 pandemic will pass. It is difficult to predict what the economy and the country will look like afterward, but if the company survives this, there are opportunities to grab. Stay alert and get ready to bounce back after the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

For many parents who now have to work remotely, they may face additional challenges concentrating on work, and dealing with their kids as coronavirus disease continues to be a problem. Parents need to implement a setup that allows them to work undisturbed and keep everyone happy.</p>\r\n<h2>Maintaining a safe and happy WFH space</h2>\r\n<p>Here are five creative ways to work productively at home by keeping the Work-From-Home, WFH, space safe and happy:</p>\r\n<h3>Develop a schedule</h3>\r\n<p>Creating a strict schedule that is identical to a normal school day can be helpful. The kids will continue to wake up, eat, and get dressed as usual. Then they can stay busy with assignments. When they are engaged, parents can focus on getting their work done. During productive hours, the kids should be distracted with playtime.</p>\r\n<h3>Use technology</h3>\r\n<p>Provide toys for the kids to play with and set time for them to use technology, away from the work area. Kids love movies or computer time, so maximize that. Educational websites are available to improve a child&#8217;s creativity. When on a strict deadline, a new movie could work like a charm.</p>\r\n<h3>Use door signs</h3>\r\n<p>There should always be a private space, though; it could be the bedroom, closet, basement, guest room, or an area where one can have undisturbed quiet space. Separating the space makes drawing the line much easier. In the WFH space, there can be a sign on the door, so when they see the &#8220;stop&#8221; sign, they know not to come in unless there is something important going on. If the sign shows &#8220;enter,&#8221; then they can come in.</p>\r\n<h3>Set boundaries for the children</h3>\r\n<p>It is necessary to set boundaries for kids when working from home, especially if they are of school age. Parents can allow their kids to watch more TV and play games than usual to stay occupied. The kids need to understand that it is temporary, however. While they are at it, parents can tell them when they do not want to be disturbed. Even if there is no designated office space in the house, establishing clear boundaries with the kids can help.</p>\r\n<h3>Old-school activities</h3>\r\n<p>Before gadgets came around, puzzles and scrapbooking were the cool stuff. They can still work to keep children busy and keep the WFH space safe and happy while the COVID-19 lockdown lasts. These activities can be interesting, and more importantly, they tend to be time-consuming. So, encourage the kids to channel their inner craftmanship during workhours.</p>\r\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\r\n<p>It is normal for children to desire attention. If both parents are working from home, creating shifts can make remote work much easier. If a parent works early in the morning, their partner can wake up the kids and handle tasks around the house. Switching shifts will allow parents to work uninterruptedly throughout the day. If switching shifts between partners are not feasible, especially for those whose partners cannot work remotely during the COVID-19 crisis, creating a strict schedule and planning could help optimize the day.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
