Fortunately, there are specific steps that one can take to reach a higher level of healthy online activity and success. The team at Doctor Genius has the knowledge and expertise to utilize the correct keywords for a client’s website and help increase their ranking online. However, effective keywords are more than simply choosing any words related to a field of medicine.\r\n<h3>What are keywords?</h3>\r\nKeywords are words or phrases that match up with terms people type in search engines online. For instance, Google explains that, “Selecting high quality, relevant keywords for your advertising campaign can help you reach the customers you want, when you want.” With so many possible terms and phrases to use, it is crucial and beneficial to invest in the services of someone who understands how to pick effective keywords.\r\n\r\nKeywords will help a professional’s website show up higher in list results of searches. This way, our clients can have their websites rank higher on search results and increase website traffic for the chance of gaining new patients. In 2015, Advanced Web Ranking found that there is a 31.5 percent click through rate for the number one position on mobile Google search results.\r\n\r\n<h3>How do keywords work?</h3>\r\nBy choosing keywords that people commonly type in search engines, your website will have a stronger chance of appearing at the top section of the search results. For instance, a common keyword can be “Emergency Dentist,” or “Whitening.” By making these keywords, people who type that word or phrase into a search engine most likely find your website before others.\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers went to a store within five miles of their home after completing a local search.<p></div>\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not as simple as flooding a website with keywords and waiting by the phone.\r\n\r\n<h3>How do you select effective keywords?</h3>\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-660\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, members of our professional team help you select the keywords that are effective in ranking and pertain to your professional services. With so many methods for selecting keywords, it can be easy to select an ineffective or faulty service. Thus, Doctor Genius will help you select the effective keywords to enhance your website.\r\n\r\nWe can also help clients use keywords that market to the local area. In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers went to a store within five miles of their home after completing a local search. It is crucial to select keywords that will rank in that area.\r\n<h3>Should I only focus on keywords?</h3>\r\nWhile keywords are an important tool for any professional’s website, they are not the only tool a professional needs. A website needs constant updates to show Google that it is active while also utilizing reviews that are a huge factor in ranking. Doctor Genius can help keep a website active and monitor social media accounts of the practice to help increase that rate of potential patients.\r\n\r\nTo answer the question, “Are Keywords Effective?” The answer is yes. However, effective keywords are only part of a much larger set of tools necessary to communicate with Google effectively.

When it comes to investing in a medical service or purchasing a product, potential customers may actually avoid websites with too much information or text. Information overload can lead to people seeking services elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<h3>Avoiding too much information</h3>\r\n\r\nIn a study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS, titled “On Making the Right Choice: The Deliberation-Without-Attention Effect,” participants chose between four cars. With one car being better than the rest, the first group of participants was given four facts about each car while a second group was given 12 facts about each car.\r\n\r\nThe results show that the group that had less information chose the better car 60 percent of the time. The group that was given 12 facts about the cars only chose the best care 20 percent of the time. This study is only one example of how too much information can dissuade a potential buyer and the same applies to potential patients for a medical practice.\r\n\r\nWith the advancements of the digital market, a variety of businesses continues to rush to create a website representing their brand, services, products and company information. Medical practices also greatly benefit from having websites. However, overloading a website with too much content will actually have a negative instead of a positive effect on the website’s conversion rate.\r\n\r\n<h3>Quality content for the audience</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-668\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> Thus, professional practice websites need to balance quality with comprehension.<p></div>\r\n\r\nWhile a website does need the right amount of content to describe services and rank online, clogging up pages with too much content or too many complex terms can make it difficult for potential patients to navigate. It is important to remember that the people looking at a medical practice’s website will be people outside of the medical field. Thus, professional practice websites need to balance quality with comprehension.\r\n\r\nIn an article online, Google states that ranking based on numbers and factors that include the freshness, diversity, rich textual and originality of content. Another factor to consider is that keywords can rank higher in search results without requiring a large amount of dense content. This is why it is crucial to have a company who understands the ins and outs of online marketing and content creation.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we can help you reach more potential patients with custom content. We strategically create content that matches your needs while also helping the website rank on search results to bring in more patients. Making a website more complex and dense will lower the conversion for potential patients.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in creating a website for your practice and branching out into the digital market, give us a call today.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

In fact, a lack of understanding on the business side of any practice can be a private practice’s downfall. Fortunately, along with other professional companies, Doctor Genius provides the necessary advice for effectively starting your own practice in today’s industry.\r\n\r\n<h3>Learn the most effective tips of the trade</h3>\r\n\r\nThe “Business of Dentistry” event takes place from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 4, 2017, at Park Plaza in Irvine, California. Affiliates and speakers of this event include professionals from companies such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Burkhart</li>\r\n \t<li>Mostofi Law Group</li>\r\n \t<li>HR for Health</li>\r\n \t<li>Bank of America Corp.®</li>\r\n \t<li>JLL® (Jones, Lang, LaSalle Incorporated)</li>\r\n \t<li>Nickerson Consulting</li>\r\n \t<li>Practice CFO</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe event is an effective opportunity for dental professionals to learn the crucial information one needs for success in the industry. This event can help professionals looking to acquire an existing practice or start their own. Many dental professionals have all the necessary degree, knowledge and expertise on dentistry to provide high-quality dental work, but do not know how to begin their own practice.\r\n\r\nWith this team of professionals, attendees will be able to earn 7 CE credits for the one-day event. Acquiring a practice or starting a new is much more than just buying the property and starting a company Facebook page.\r\n\r\n<h3>Reach more potential patients</h3>\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july25-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-651\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july25-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july25-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july25-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 300px; border-left: 3px solid #666666; margin-center: 1px; padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 20px;\"> Do not miss out on the opportunity to start your dental practice with a strong foot forward.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Genius has the necessary tools and expertise to help clients reach large amounts of potential patients online.

We will also cover the details of acquiring a practice and how to continue running a dental practice.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we understand that navigating the digital market can be difficult. With a variety of odd and sometimes cumbersome requirements, it is no wonder that other dental practices fall into obscurity. Let our services help prevent that from happening.
