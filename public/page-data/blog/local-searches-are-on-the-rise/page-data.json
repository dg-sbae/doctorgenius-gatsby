This is something that every retailer needs to know and plan for as part of their online marketing. Over the past decade, coupon sites have become more and more popular with affiliates offering a variety of ways to buy something for less money. This can be a good thing when you work with affiliates that have high traffic counts and excellent SEO. After all, the coupons offered on their website can drive more traffic and conversions on yours. The challenge becomes managing the process correctly.\r\n\r\nDo you offer coupons and if so, how do they impact your conversions? This is something that every retailer needs to know and plan for as part of their online marketing. Over the past decade, coupon sites have become more and more popular with affiliates offering a variety of ways to buy something for less money. This can be a good thing when you work with affiliates that have high traffic counts and excellent SEO. After all, the coupons offered on their website can drive more traffic and conversions on yours. The challenge becomes managing the process correctly.\r\n\r\nIn our online marketing plan, be sure to consider how you want to work with your affiliates to ensure that when you do use them to promote coupons, you are not giving up commissions unnecessarily. For example, if someone is in your shopping cart and decides to open a new tab to find a coupon code, the affiliate can track that as a sale using cookies. You will in turn pay a commission, even though the person was on your website first. With that in mind, have your web developer create landing pages and separate URL’s that affiliates can direct traffic to. This will help to keep some of your customers separate. In fact, if you have separate landing pages, you may be able to remove the coupon code section entirely from your main shopping cart. This way the shoppers looking for a discount can come from a coupon site while your regular customers can happily continue paying full price.\r\n\r\nOne way to successfully use coupons is to create promotions on social media. Your Facebook page, for example, is an excellent place to create a graphic with a coupon code or let everyone know that your new inventory is in and the first fifty customers get a discount. With social media, you can drive conversions because these are people that are already familiar with your brand and want to hear from you. People performing a local search are likely to find your website or your social media page, so this is an excellent way to capture business from that traffic as well.\r\n\r\nWe also suggest that you create various events to help drive conversions. This can be used in conjunction with local search by optimizing the content on your website. For example, you could have a trunk sale twice a year and incorporate a breadth of content regarding the issue on your website. That way when users search for one in your local area, your website comes up. Next, promote the trunk sale through social media so that your existing customers can participate. Online promotions and events should be fun and creative so keep that in mind and adjust as needed to drive more conversions.","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Practice Management"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/recentpost-04-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEA//EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABuTRTpBDF/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEhEhMTL/2gAIAQEAAQUC1krLgnjv5tP/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhP/2gAIAQMBAT8BZ0//xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIS/9oACAECAQE/AbQ2/8QAHBAAAgEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEBEhMVGR/9oACAEBAAY/Ar00SjxDMJeH/8QAHBABAAMAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBUZGh/9oACAEBAAE/IXTy3W5dr9Yte8ClcCnuUCDhgjg3sf/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQHN//xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhQf/aAAgBAwEBPxBLwh2qf//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEVH/2gAIAQIBAT8QwNg8b//EAB4QAQEAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQVFhgZHx/9oACAEBAAE/ELNkiuK2Q/co1HqieNdWYwQIzTv7ytnUkVnOaLQgbv5yokbKFV95/9k=","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/a7715/recentpost-04-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/9dc27/recentpost-04-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/4fe8c/recentpost-04-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/a7715/recentpost-04-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"3a6b315d-1126-55df-8813-716faeeadd65"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null},"prevPost":{"title":"Local Searches Are on the Rise","slug":"local-searches-are-on-the-rise-2","excerpt":"Google has reported that mobile searches containing the phrases “near me” or “nearby” have doubled over the past twelve months.<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/local-searches-are-on-the-rise-2/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Google has reported that mobile searches containing the phrases “near me” or “nearby” have doubled over the past twelve months. This represents a significant increase in the number of people conducting a local search, determined to connect with a business close by. This can benefit your dental practice by connecting you with a prospective patient that is in immediate need of your services.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Nearby Business Listings product</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>To capitalize on this growing trend, Google is offering a new advertising product. The Nearby Business Listings product replaces some of the typical ad copy with features that consumers use on a regular basis. Features like click-to-call and click-for-directions appear in the ad so that when someone is conducting a local search, they can find a nearby business and immediately connect with them. If the search is a mobile search, the convenience of immediately navigating to the business cannot be overstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a dentist, you should also consider how you can use this knowledge in your current marketing plans. As a company that specializes in optimizing for local search, we recommend that you check all of your online business listings to ensure that your information is accurate. Your name, address, phone number, and hours of operation need to be included with your business listings to ensure that someone can find you in a local search. Additionally, you should optimize your website for mobile users. We recommend building a responsive design website that adjusts based on the type of device that is being used to view it. This will allow your site to have built-in features like click-to-call or click-for-directions. Given how many people conduct a mobile search for a local dentist, this is an easy way to ensure that they call you instead of a dentist down the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneously, your website needs to be optimized for local search. When creating your SEO strategy, it is important to include your location in multiple places on your site. Think of the phrase that people will use when searching for a dental office in your area (or better yet – have us pull the analytics for you). For example, if you are in Orange County, California, do people search for an “OC dentist”, “Orange County dentist”, etc.? The terms and phrases that they would use should be incorporated into the content on your website, giving your site the opportunity to show up when someone does a local search for a “dentist nearby”. After all, the search engines know where you are located based on the information that you give them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can audit your website to ensure that it is mobile friendly and that you are optimized to show up in a local search. This way you can benefit from the increase in mobile searches for a dentist “near me”.</p>","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Digital Marketing"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/trend-04-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/a7715/trend-04-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/9dc27/trend-04-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/4fe8c/trend-04-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/a7715/trend-04-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"10d9bdca-af32-5803-a722-8325e9ef457e"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null},"nextPost":{"title":"A Blog is the Heartbeat of a Company Website","slug":"a-blog-is-the-heartbeat-of-a-company-website","excerpt":"Even if you don’t know much about blogs, it’s probably obvious to you that they have become more and more<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/a-blog-is-the-heartbeat-of-a-company-website/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"Even if you don’t know much about blogs, it’s probably obvious to you that they have become more and more popular over the years. You’re probably puzzled about why on earth blogs are so popular. Some people might even think that they seem a waste of time, right? Wrong. Blogging has become the trendy, believable way to market your business, and it’s likely this is a trend that is only going to become more influential and have more power than many other forms of advertising.\r\n\r\nThe importance of blogging is hard to understand if you don’t understand the basics of what a blog really is. Let’s look at the world of blogs (a.k.a. the “blogosphere”) in a little more detail.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is a Blog, anyway?</strong>\r\nA blog, which used to be referred to as a web log, is an avenue of sharing with others online. When blogging first started it was basically online journaling. These days, blogging has taken on a whole new meaning. Even though many blogs still exist that are solely the voices of random people, sitting at coffee shops or on their couch, looking for a way to share their innermost voices and opinions about random subjects, there are also an entirely different class of blogs. This other “class” of bloggers is focused on marketing businesses, brands and gaining followers who happily look to them for direction in the online marketplace.\r\n\r\nThink of a blog as a tour guide. Just like we turn to people we trust and respect for advice on what to do in life, a blog can provide a similar comfort level in the online world.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the benefits of Blogging?</strong>\r\nThe main reason for any type of marketing is to grow your business. In your case, not only do you want to gain new patients, you want to make sure that you keep your current ones. So how can a blog help you to accomplish those things?\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Show those search engines who’s boss.</strong> Want to be top-ranking when people Google “local dentists”? Posting to a blog is of utmost importance. Think of your company’s website as a heart and your blog as what keeps it beating. A consistently updated blog with current information (you know, the stuff people actually read) will up your ranking, up your traffic and get you more business.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Prove that you know your stuff.</strong> A blog will help you establish yourself as an authoritative figure that is on top of your specialty. Talk about the trending topics and the latest treatments and procedures and keep people informed. They’ll be more apt to turn to you if they trust you’re education and practices are up to date.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Relate to your patients.</strong> Showing your patients that you’re not just all business all the time will help them to see you as a person and a friend rather than just a service provider. Building relationships is the best form of marketing and blogging will help you to achieve it. Show your personality and the personality of your staff. Write about causes that interest you or hobbies you enjoy. If they see you as just Dr. Jane, you’re kind of boring. If they know you as Dr. Jane who has two Huskies who used to play roller derby and enjoys sailing, you’re much more exciting.\r\n\r\n<strong>Should you BE the Blogger or hire one?\r\n</strong>Now that you get a sense of why having a blog is so critical to marketing your business online, just how you want to accomplish it is up to you. If you don’t have the time or feel unqualified to start and manage your own blog, there are many blogging services out there that are up to the task. Some business owners enjoy writing their own content, while many others find it simpler and more effective to hire an article writer to take care of it for them.\r\n\r\nBeing “social” online needs to involve a mix of informational posts with a good portion of personality. No one wants to be bored out of their mind reading posts after post of your business “mission”! Come on! Would you waste your time reading that stuff? Probably not. To get interest and make people want to read your posts they need to be intriguing. Hiring a writer and someone to manage your blog has great benefit for that reason. They’re purpose is to make sure you have a good online presence and your job remains the same: to run your practice.\r\n\r\n<strong>How to share content across different social profiles</strong>\r\nIn order to get the most out of your blog, it’s important to make sure your posts are SEEN. The best avenue of spreading blog content is to announce it on various social channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn. Keep in mind that images get much more attention than text alone (and might even be “pinned” on Pinterest). Try posting an image with the content attached. Also, make sure that your posts are accompanied by social media “connect” buttons so that readers can quickly and easily share your images and content across their social scene as well.","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Genius Lab"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/recentpost-02-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/9dc27/recentpost-02-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/4fe8c/recentpost-02-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"a3feb621-2bd4-526a-8aa2-73f3bf8a1cff"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null}},"pageContext":{"currentNode":{"slug":"local-searches-are-on-the-rise","wordpress_id":218},"currentID":218,"prevNode":{"slug":"local-searches-are-on-the-rise-2","wordpress_id":222},"prevID":222,"nextNode":{"slug":"a-blog-is-the-heartbeat-of-a-company-website","wordpress_id":212},"nextID":212}},"staticQueryHashes":["3603905760"]}
