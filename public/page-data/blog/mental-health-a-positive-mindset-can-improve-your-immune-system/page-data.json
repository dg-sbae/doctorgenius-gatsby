An optimistic mindset would suit you better, though. Research shows that having a positive mindset helps strengthen your immune system, your body&#8217;s first line of defense against the COVID-19 virus.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping a positive mindset during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Studies have shown that <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html\">stress sources, like tension at work or marital spats, can promote diseases and hinder recovery</a>. Here are simple things you can do to keep your stress levels at a minimum during these uncertain times:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Establishing a work-life balance</h3>\r\n<p>Having a good balance between the time you spend working and the time spent doing things that refresh you (like spending time with family) is one of those things that most busy people struggle with, particularly business owners. With most of the country under some form of quarantine. People now have more time to spend with their loved ones and improve their relationships.</p>\r\n<p>It is best to be proactive about your work-life balance. Plan our your daily schedule ahead of time and include activities with the family, like helping the kids with their remote learning. While people cannot wait for this pandemic to be over with, they can use this time to establish a work-life balance.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Lower your operating costs</h3>\r\n<p>Business owners have to adapt to COVID-19 by taking advantage of tools like video phone conferencing, since meeting face to face is currently not an option for many. The good thing is that it will reduce your operating costs and can show you new ways to make your business more efficient.</p>\r\n<p>Growing and sustaining a business remotely is a huge challenge, but many business owners are doing exactly that. It will also save you money in the long run.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Capitalize on new opportunities</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 is causing disruptions to our lives in ways we have never seen before. Time-tested systems that have been used for manufacturing, studying, working, and living are being destroyed all around us. Without a doubt, some businesses will be forced to close, but it also creates massive opportunities in many industries.</p>\r\n<p>The world is now trying to figure out better ways to learn, work, live, and run businesses. Those who come up with solutions to the problems created by the coronavirus will have success. For example, some dental clinics are now using video conferencing tools to diagnose patients, educate them on how to deal with their issues, and determine if they need to come to the clinic for emergency dental work.</p>\r\n<h2>Don&#8217;t stress over problems created by COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Instead, find solutions to these problems, and your business will emerge better than it was before the pandemic started.</p>\r\n<p><em>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As the numbers grow and more areas go into lockdown,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/ask-the-experts-5-ways-to-scale-your-business-during-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread at an alarming rate. As the numbers grow and more areas go into lockdown, its impact on businesses is profound and unprecedented by anything we have seen in recent times. As governments take drastic measures in response to coronavirus, practices also need to adjust quickly to navigate the financial and operational difficulties that accompany the pandemic. This article contains insights from experts on how to scale your business during COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h2>Scaling your Business during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>The following are ways that practice owners can scale their establishments during the pandemic:</p>\r\n<h3>Provide flexibility</h3>\r\n<p>Stores, businesses, schools, and commercial centers around the country are shutting down operations. As the country approaches total lockdown, business owners need to give their employees more flexibility with time.</p>\r\n<p>There are many tools available to business owners to ensure efficient communication with their employers. This will allow everyone to stay in touch and keep working even if they are not in the office. There should be a policy in place regarding work policy, like when team members need to be online and available, a medium of communication (like Slack, Google Hangouts, or WhatsApp) and the deliverables for each team member.</p>\r\n<h3>Enable direct communications with customers</h3>\r\n<p>This crisis affects everyone, so it is better to be completely open about what the business is experiencing. Customers will understand the challenges that the brand is facing if they receive regular updates. When customers no longer have access to the details about the efforts done behind the scenes to get routine services, their appreciation for the service reduces, and they begin to value it less. Business owners need to explain the measures they are taking to curb risks and provide insights into the steps they are taking regarding community service.</p>\r\n<h3>Shift your sales tactics online</h3>\r\n<p>When physical locations are no longer an option, savvy business owners need to consider leveraging online platforms to curb heavy losses. Digital platforms enable interactions with customers and boost online sales. This could significantly increase the company’s sales. Businesses can keep your employees engaged and earning by selling on social media and websites, using email lists, and generating new leads with the internet.</p>\r\n<h3>Capitalize on the brand’s value</h3>\r\n<p>Brands add value to their customers, and the products or services that are beneficial during the crisis deserve the consideration of those who need them. If what the practice does supports or eases people’s lives during the lockdown, business owners need to capitalize on that and tell the brand’s story. As long as the practice focuses on delivering value, marketing and sales will continue.</p>\r\n<h3>Make necessary evaluations</h3>\r\n<p>To keep the practice running throughout the coronavirus pandemic, owners need to make critical evaluations of what matters more to the company’s survival. This includes evaluating the supply chain for vulnerabilities and identifying teams and workers that ensure essential operations or services keep running.</p>\r\n<h2>Importance of staying resilient</h2>\r\n<p>It is hard to tell when the COVID-19 pandemic will end. However, business owners can scale their businesses and stay on top of the situation by staying proactive and taking necessary measures. It is in times like this that the strength of the practice is put to the test, and those who adapt survice.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

With this in mind, dental practices are wondering how to proceed in a post-COVID-19 world. Our team at Doctor Genius is here to help practices go over what they will need to help reach patients and go over the new process for dental treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Now, more than ever, it is crucial for practices to send out the right message to patients. Doctor Genius can help.</p>\r\n<h3>Following the Latest State Mandates and Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>Since each state has different mandates for dental practices and quarantine regulations, it is essential for dental practices to remain on top of it. The <a href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/covid-19-state-mandates-and-recommendations?utm_source=cpsorg&amp;utm_medium=covid-cps-virus-lp&amp;utm_content=state-mandates&amp;utm_campaign=covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ADA Center for Professional Success&#x2122;</a> is keeping track of each state and what is allowed when it comes to dental services.</p>\r\n<p>Since each state is unique, there are a variety of changes and steps that dental practices will need to take. Along with that, we can help go over how to express these changes to patients in a positive way. We can offer you support during these challenging times, which will still have an impact on society well after the quarantine is lifted.</p>\r\n<p>This only increases the notion that practices need to have a plan for re-opening. A recent Doctor Genius Webinar covers the details about developing a plan for dental practices known as the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius-1.wistia.com/medias/5yv90rvx3c\" target=\" _blank\">Practice Recovery Blueprint</a>. Along with helping to set up a plan, we can help you capture the message your practice sends to patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Building Your Message to Patients</h3>\r\n<p>While having an active website with constantly updating content relevant to your practice is important, there are new questions that patients will have in a post-COVID-19 world. These questions can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n\t<li>What are the new hours?</li>\r\n\t<li>Can I schedule an appointment this week?</li>\r\n\t<li>What constitutes a dental emergency?</li>\r\n\t<li>Should I try to put my tooth back in if it falls out?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do I need to wear a facemask in the lobby?</li>\r\n\t<li>If my child is receiving dental care, can I wait in the lobby?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are only a few of the possible questions patients may have. At Doctor Genius, we understand this is a stressful time for dentists and patients alike. Thus, it is the perfect time to talk with us about developing a message and content to reach out to your community. Patients will be looking for advice on scheduling, sudden oral health issues, oral hygiene, and follow-up care. We can help provide content that uses SEO keywords pertaining to your practice along with any guidelines or information you need patients to know.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius will strive to help equip you with the tools, content, and platform necessary to become a source of information for the current and potential patients within your community. We have the right content to help your patients understand when, where, and how to reach you with changes in everything.
