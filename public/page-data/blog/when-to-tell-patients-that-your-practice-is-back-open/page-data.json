With this in mind, dental practices are wondering how to proceed in a post-COVID-19 world. Our team at Doctor Genius is here to help practices go over what they will need to help reach patients and go over the new process for dental treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Now, more than ever, it is crucial for practices to send out the right message to patients. Doctor Genius can help.</p>\r\n<h3>Following the Latest State Mandates and Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>Since each state has different mandates for dental practices and quarantine regulations, it is essential for dental practices to remain on top of it. The <a href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/covid-19-state-mandates-and-recommendations?utm_source=cpsorg&amp;utm_medium=covid-cps-virus-lp&amp;utm_content=state-mandates&amp;utm_campaign=covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ADA Center for Professional Success&#x2122;</a> is keeping track of each state and what is allowed when it comes to dental services.</p>\r\n<p>Since each state is unique, there are a variety of changes and steps that dental practices will need to take. Along with that, we can help go over how to express these changes to patients in a positive way. We can offer you support during these challenging times, which will still have an impact on society well after the quarantine is lifted.</p>\r\n<p>This only increases the notion that practices need to have a plan for re-opening. A recent Doctor Genius Webinar covers the details about developing a plan for dental practices known as the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius-1.wistia.com/medias/5yv90rvx3c\" target=\" _blank\">Practice Recovery Blueprint</a>. Along with helping to set up a plan, we can help you capture the message your practice sends to patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Building Your Message to Patients</h3>\r\n<p>While having an active website with constantly updating content relevant to your practice is important, there are new questions that patients will have in a post-COVID-19 world. These questions can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n\t<li>What are the new hours?</li>\r\n\t<li>Can I schedule an appointment this week?</li>\r\n\t<li>What constitutes a dental emergency?</li>\r\n\t<li>Should I try to put my tooth back in if it falls out?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do I need to wear a facemask in the lobby?</li>\r\n\t<li>If my child is receiving dental care, can I wait in the lobby?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are only a few of the possible questions patients may have. At Doctor Genius, we understand this is a stressful time for dentists and patients alike. Thus, it is the perfect time to talk with us about developing a message and content to reach out to your community. Patients will be looking for advice on scheduling, sudden oral health issues, oral hygiene, and follow-up care. We can help provide content that uses SEO keywords pertaining to your practice along with any guidelines or information you need patients to know.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius will strive to help equip you with the tools, content, and platform necessary to become a source of information for the current and potential patients within your community. We have the right content to help your patients understand when, where, and how to reach you with changes in everything.

An optimistic mindset would suit you better, though. Research shows that having a positive mindset helps strengthen your immune system, your body&#8217;s first line of defense against the COVID-19 virus.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping a positive mindset during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Studies have shown that <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html\">stress sources, like tension at work or marital spats, can promote diseases and hinder recovery</a>. Here are simple things you can do to keep your stress levels at a minimum during these uncertain times:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Establishing a work-life balance</h3>\r\n<p>Having a good balance between the time you spend working and the time spent doing things that refresh you (like spending time with family) is one of those things that most busy people struggle with, particularly business owners. With most of the country under some form of quarantine. People now have more time to spend with their loved ones and improve their relationships.</p>\r\n<p>It is best to be proactive about your work-life balance. Plan our your daily schedule ahead of time and include activities with the family, like helping the kids with their remote learning. While people cannot wait for this pandemic to be over with, they can use this time to establish a work-life balance.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Lower your operating costs</h3>\r\n<p>Business owners have to adapt to COVID-19 by taking advantage of tools like video phone conferencing, since meeting face to face is currently not an option for many. The good thing is that it will reduce your operating costs and can show you new ways to make your business more efficient.</p>\r\n<p>Growing and sustaining a business remotely is a huge challenge, but many business owners are doing exactly that. It will also save you money in the long run.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Capitalize on new opportunities</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 is causing disruptions to our lives in ways we have never seen before. Time-tested systems that have been used for manufacturing, studying, working, and living are being destroyed all around us. Without a doubt, some businesses will be forced to close, but it also creates massive opportunities in many industries.</p>\r\n<p>The world is now trying to figure out better ways to learn, work, live, and run businesses. Those who come up with solutions to the problems created by the coronavirus will have success. For example, some dental clinics are now using video conferencing tools to diagnose patients, educate them on how to deal with their issues, and determine if they need to come to the clinic for emergency dental work.</p>\r\n<h2>Don&#8217;t stress over problems created by COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Instead, find solutions to these problems, and your business will emerge better than it was before the pandemic started.</p>\r\n<p><em>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Washing your hands might help you keep the virus away, but it will not bring more customers to your business.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping your business moving forward during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>This article will go over tactics you can use to keep your business above water as you navigate around the uncertainty created by the coronavirus. Here are simple ways to positively impact your business and customers.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Use automated lead processes</h3>\r\n<p>Business owners should already have automated lead generation systems in place. If your business does not already have one, now is a good time to start. Such systems can easily help you double your sales and bring in extra revenue that might help keep the doors of your business open.</p>\r\n<p>Businesses without automated ways to generate leads are essentially running up a hill. They often end up spending more money to generate fewer leads. Automating the process allows business owners to sell their products and services even when the business is closed.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Streamline systems and use fewer workers</h3>\r\n<p>It is typically easier to manage a system than it is to manage individuals. People tend to become more unreliable during stressful times, and having a system in place makes it easier to determine which employees are contributing the most. It also allows them to work more efficiently.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Provide safeguards for customers</h3>\r\n<p>With so much uncertainty going around, providing safeguards for customers will make them more likely to purchase your business&#8217;s products and services. Let customers know how your business is adapting to the coronavirus and what will happen if you are not able to fulfill your end of the contract due to the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Understanding how potential customers have been affected by the coronavirus can also help increase your sales. For example, providing payment plans can be helpful when dealing with customers whose income has been limited by COVID-19. Surveys are a great way to get into the minds of potential customers and understand their concerns. The business can then implement safeguards that address these concerns.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Use high-quality copy</h3>\r\n<p>People being quarantined due to the coronavirus means that they are spending more time online. Having a website or web marketing system gives business owners a huge competitive advantage right now.</p>\r\n<p>Marketing tactics like search engine optimization will bring traffic to a business, but that is only half the battle. Engaging copy on your website is what builds trust with the person and prompts them to make a purchase. It involves placing relevant content at the top of the page.</p>\r\n<p>Focusing on the quantity of content on a website over quality rarely ever works out for the business. People will not trust your business if you have poorly written content on your site, and you will not generate much revenue with weak sales pitches.</p>\r\n<h2>Take advantage of new opportunities</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 brings its share of challenges, but it also brings many opportunities that smart business owners can take advantage of for their benefit. Contact Doctor Genius to learn more about how your business can survive the coronavirus by increasing your focus on internet marketing.</p>\r\n<p><em>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
