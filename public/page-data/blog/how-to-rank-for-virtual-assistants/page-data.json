Virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana, Alexa, and Google Home have become increasingly prevalent and staple in many people’s lives. It is not uncommon for people to have several virtual assistants integrated with their smart devices like home systems, mobile devices, cars, smartwatches, and even television remotes. Here are some tips and insights to help your practice be one of the first options when someone uses a voice search.</p>\r\n<h2>Choosing the Right Keyword Phrases for Virtual Assistants</h2>\r\n<p>Keywords are the foundation of all SEO. Various factors determine a webpage’s ranking. However, performing keyword research and implementing these phrases into a website’s content is much more likely to get higher on the SERP. It is important to note that the keywords that are successful in online search engines are not always the same for voice search.</p>\r\n<h3>Considering Natural Speech</h3>\r\n<p>One of the most effective ways one can increase their practice’s ranking for voice search is by understanding the difference between the way people speak and the way people write. People are much more likely to use fragmented phrases when searching for content on a mobile device or computer. In this case, short-tail keywords can be more successful. On the other hand, people often speak in complete sentences, even when talking to a virtual assistant, as speaking out loud is easier and quicker than typing.</p>\r\n<p>The content should include long-tail keyword phrases formatted like a question to improve the voice search SEO. Instead of optimizing for a short phrase like “root canal treatment,” include a long-tail keyword like, “Where can I get a root canal treated?” People will often include more context when using voice search, which pulls up different results than a more general search inquiry.</p>\r\n<h3>FAQ Pages</h3>\r\n<p>An effective method to incorporate more questions into a website’s written content is by including FAQs. Having a designated <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/best-faq-page-examples/267709/#close\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/best-faq-page-examples/267709/#close\">FAQ page</a> is one way to do this. One can also structure blog posts and other page content into a question and answer format by turning primary headers into questions. For instance, instead of using the header, “Types of Clear Aligners,” a website can use “What Are the Different Types of Clear Aligners?” The following section would then aim to answer that question.</p>\r\n<h3>Prioritizing Local SEO</h3>\r\n<p>While local SEO is essential regardless of the search method used, voice search is more likely to be tailored to the location. Virtual assistants and mobile devices are often linked, so information about the user like search history, preferences, and location is known. People often use Siri or other AI technologies to search for activities, restaurants, and stores nearby. It is important to focus on the local audience, as few people will travel far outside the city they reside or work in to seek care.</p>\r\n<p>Using location-specific keywords can increase the chances someone will see one practice before another. People also often ask a general query like, “Where is a chiropractor near me?” In this case, it would be beneficial to use a keyword phrase like, “Where is a dentist in Spokane?”</p>\r\n<h3>Google My Business</h3>\r\n<p>Having a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\">Google My Business</a> listing and making sure that it is up to date can help local keyword phrases lead people to a business. This listing should have relevant info like the address, phone number, category, and business hours. Google My Business also gives patients a platform to leave reviews, photos, and questions. The account&#8217;s success can have a significant impact on SEO ranking for virtual assistants.</p>\r\n<h3>Ranking for Different Virtual Assistants</h3>\r\n<p>Each virtual assistant has its own set of criteria to consider for ranking. Not all virtual assistants use the same search engine to pull results when someone uses voice search, so they may need to consider optimizing content for more than one. Most businesses primarily focus on Google, the primary search engine for Google Home, Android devices, and Siri. However, Bing is the default search engine for both Alexa and Cortana. Although users can ask most virtual assistants to use a different search engine, many do not. Taking the time to understand and optimize content for multiple search engines can help a website better reach more users.</p>\r\n<p>It can be challenging to rank any products that one&#8217;s practice might sell on Alexa. As Alexa is an Amazon product, it prioritizes Amazon Choice items or suggests items similar to the searcher’s previous purchases. If the search query does not have an Amazon Choice item, Alexa will provide the top search result that is Prime eligible. There is no way to apply for being an Amazon Choice product. Prime eligible products have a high rating, are bought often, have a low return rate, and are in stock and ready to ship.</p>\r\n<h2>Get Your Practice Seen and Heard</h2>\r\n<p>With so many factors to consider for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/just-magic-seo-services-doctor-genius\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/just-magic-seo-services-doctor-genius\">SEO</a>, it can be challenging for your practice to reach its entire audience.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill.

Your practice must stand out on the internet to do well in a competitive industry. Establishing trust with your audience is a great way to stand out from the competition. One way to build this trust is by including your affiliation with an organization. This information provides trust signals that can contribute to more page views and clients.</p>\r\n<h2>The Benefits of Listing Professional Affiliations</h2>\r\n<p>It is important to list the professional organizations a company is affiliated with when creating a webpage for a practice. Listing this information can improve conversion numbers by showcasing professionalism and providing examples of personal endeavors. Doing this will help establish audience trust and help boost website search results. It is easy to create content that speaks to one&#8217;s affiliations.</p>\r\n<h3>Website SEO Content</h3>\r\n<p>A website is the first impression many potential clients have of a practice. It should provide responsible and engaging content that relates relevant information to the audience without being overwhelming. While it is effective to list professional affiliations in the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section of the website, it is also beneficial to incorporate them in <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly/\">regular blog posts</a> to boost SEO-driven hits.</p>\r\n<h3>Approval and Endorsement From a Professional Organization</h3>\r\n<p>Many people start searches with a query about fixing a problem. Creating blogs about the services a practice offers to solve those problems can help with ranking. One can easily integrate an organizational affiliation into those blogs by highlighting any organization-approved methods or products used in treatments or services. Creating blog posts about industry news and the organizations relevant to it can also help raise one&#8217;s profile. The website can also include any practice-specific news. For example, if the <a href=\"https://www.aaoinfo.org/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.aaoinfo.org/\">American Association of Orthodontists</a> endorses the office, highlighting this membership can increase reliability rating with readers.</p>\r\n<h3>Affiliation With Charitable Organizations</h3>\r\n<p>The practice should also list any affiliations with charitable organizations. Information about volunteering with organizations like Operation Smile or Easterseals can also help practice ranking. Showing how practice members lent their time and skills is another way organizational affiliation can build audience trust. Blog posts about practice involvement in charitable organizations are another excellent way to get more website hits and include affiliate links to the relevant sites.</p>\r\n<h2>We Know SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Listing an affiliation with a professional organization is important for SEO. Including this information on a website can help you build credibility and rank higher in the search results.
