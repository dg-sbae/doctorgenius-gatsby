For a private practice, having positive reviews from patients can greatly increase the likelihood of new patients seeking treatment from said practice. While patients can leave negative reviews, statistics show that online users will search for businesses online before searching elsewhere. It is also important to note is that without reviews, Google will not rank the website.\r\n<h3>The importance of sharing customer reviews</h3>\r\nIn a survey of 2,000 people from Brightlocal.com, 57 percent of patients searched online for a local business at least more than six times a year, 39 percent searched online at least one time per month and 15 percent searched almost every day. When searching online, patients will also take into account what other customers have to say about the business. While a private practice may be concerned over negative reviews, having no reviews in an online presence will be worse.\r\n\r\nThe same survey finds that in 2014, about 58 percent of consumers searched for restaurants and 38 percent searched online for doctors or dentists in their area. Behind searching for restaurants, medical practices were the next most-searched type of content online. The study also finds that in 2014, around 88 percent of consumers read online reviews to determine the quality of business.\r\n<h5><strong>“around 67 percent of consumers needed to read at least six Benefits of reviews before they feel they can trust the business.”</strong></h5>\r\nPeople use the Internet to find a doctor or dentist in their area that provides that specific level of care that they need. While patients may use referrals from friends or family, patient reviews will also play an important part in deciding on a private practice for treatment. For a private practice, seeking patient reviews to post on the practice’s website is a great way to display positive reviews. If one does not want reviews on the website for their practice, then at least through websites such as Yelp or Google, to give the practice a better presence online.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-340\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>How people may respond to those reviews</h3>\r\nWith a strong online presence and a website, a private practice will be able to begin drawing in more customers. On average, Brightlocal.com finds that in 2014, around 67 percent of consumers needed to read at least six Benefits of reviews before they feel they can trust the business. Meanwhile, 85 percent needed to read up to 10 reviews before trusting a business. Thus, having online reviews will help to market the practice and draw in more new patients.\r\n\r\nFor any practice worried about a bad review getting in the way or being a problem for new business, the team at Doctor Genius can help handle that.

Lately, it seems that many businesses rely on discounts and specials to bring in more consumers. Many private practices charge fair and average rates already, making discounts unnecessary. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help a private practice establish trust with patients without relying on constant deals or discounts.\r\n<h3>Consistency online and in the office</h3>\r\nWhile there is nothing wrong with a private practice offering discounts or specials on specific procedures, no effective business model can offer them consistently. Offering too many deals on a regular basis can increase costs and lead to financial difficulties in the future. Establishing trust with patients will require more than discounts. The patient needs to feel that this practice will treat his or her health issue efficiently and at a fair cost. BizReport states that 76 percent of consumers view customer service as a test of how much the company values them.\r\n\r\nHaving a website can be extremely beneficial for a private practice, granting current and future patients access to information about the practice and services provided. Regardless of what the website states, if the patient finds out that the practice does not offer that specific service or does not follow through on the web content, then the patient is more likely to leave the practice. In order for patients to trust a private practice, they need to find consistent information on the website that matches the core values of the practice.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with the client to provide quality content for the specific practice and the services it provides. We can help to target what patients look for in a website for a private practice and incorporate it onto the web pages. With consistency, the patient should not feel cheated when arriving at the practice.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-353\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10b-TheStudy-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>Keep an active online presence through website and social media platforms</h3>\r\nA private practice can have a website and social media platform, but not rank high in Google search results. This means that no one will be able to find the private practice’s website online unless they type in the precise name of the practice. In other cases, a private practice will have a website but not update any blogs or posts on a social media page. Thus, the client finds a website that does not have an active post from within the current year.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, a website without reviews from the last year will also push patients away from the website. A lack of updated content can make a patient feel the practice is also outdated or not on top of things, motivating the patient to look elsewhere.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><em>&#8220;&#8230;76 percent of consumers view customer service as a test of how much the company values them.&#8221;</em></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we can keep up regular blog postings to a website and keep up regular social media posts as well. We understand that it can be difficult for a private practice to balance taking care of patients along with keeping up an effective online presence in the digital landscape. We maintain active content circulating on a website to help keep the website current.

From dentistry to chiropractic care, patients need to feel that the treatment they receive at the professional practice is having a positive and long-term effect on their overall condition. At Doctor Genius, we can help review methods for finding effective solutions to treat your patients.\r\n<h3>Finding the best solution is not easy</h3>\r\nWhile the main issue for any patient is always about treating pain, patients also need constant care and a practice they can trust. Patients are cautious to trust a medical practice until the practice proves that it is reliable, effective, honest and a strong source of support. The key factor, regardless of the situation, is support. We can help our Doctor Genius clients provide their patients with the care they need.\r\n\r\nWith various forms to fill out, insurance difficulties, payment options, scheduling conflicts and other factors, the treatment experience can be difficult and complicated for the patient. If the process becomes too complex or confusing, the patient is more likely to seek treatment elsewhere. A good support begins with the first phone call to schedule an appointment. Having a website with all the necessary information and forms the patient needs to fill out will also help ease the process.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the client can fill out the forms before visiting the office or fill them out in the waiting room. Regardless, the patient will have prior knowledge of the forms and what information will be necessary. The earlier the patient has this information, the more time the patient will have to ask any questions or address any concerns.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-334\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>Provide constant support during and after treatment</h3>\r\nIn order to build a strong relationship with patients and help ensure they return in the future, a practice needs to offer a solid support system during and after treatment. This does not mean that the practice needs to go above and beyond every single day. A solid support system means consistency when needing to answer questions, address concerns, being honest with patients and helping patients understand the treatment.\r\n\r\nDuring an appointment, regardless of the patient being established or new, the medical professional needs to address any concerns of the patient while maintaining a calm atmosphere. When a client comes to a dentist with a toothache, he or she is not only searching for treatment for a toothache, but also for a reliable source of treatment for other dental issues in the future.\r\n\r\nA patient may only need a simple checkup but will want to know that this practice will take his or her concerns to mind. Even if the patient does not need a follow-up procedure after the appointment, the patient will want to know what is next. The professional should go over what the patient needs to do to ensure complete recovery.
