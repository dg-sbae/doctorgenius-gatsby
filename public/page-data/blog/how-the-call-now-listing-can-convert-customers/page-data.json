It helps to make it as easy as possible for potential patients to make an appointment, and we all know the simplest solution is often the right one. Here are some reasons why a good call-to-action phrase can make a difference in your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Simplifying the process</h2>\r\n<p>Even the most creative websites are not going to convert clients if the clients are unsure about what the next steps are. Here are examples of how a CTA can convert potential patients by making it easier for them to buy something or make an appointment. </p>\r\n<h3>It encourages obedience</h3>\r\n<p>From even the earliest years of life, people are used to being told what to do. This explains why a CTA in the form of a command tends to be more effective than one in the form of a question. For example, someone is more likely to click on a link or button that says &#8220;Purchase now!&#8221; than one that says &#8220;Are you ready to purchase?&#8221; Using an <a href=\"http://www.smbceo.com/2018/02/16/why-ctas-are-the-most-important-thing-on-your-website/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.smbceo.com/2018/02/16/why-ctas-are-the-most-important-thing-on-your-website/\">authoritative command</a> can be very convincing for many potential patients. Without a CTA, they can be unsure of what to do next. </p>\r\n<h3>It promotes conversion</h3>\r\n<p>In most cases, a simple, direct CTA can convert a client because it does not require much thought. For example, &#8220;Click here to schedule an appointment&#8221; is effective because it both tells patients what to do and allows them to set an appointment without having to call the office directly. Without that CTA, clients viewing the website would have to make a decision about whether that office was the right choice for them, track down a contact number, and call to set up the appointment. Many customers <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/#6936250b801b\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/#6936250b801b\">will not take the time</a> to do that and will look elsewhere. </p>\r\n<h3>It draws the reader&#8217;s attention</h3>\r\n<p>On a page full of black and white words, a bright red button or bold red text can effectively stand out and pull the reader&#8217;s gaze where you want it to go. While viewers already interested in a product or service may take the time to search a website for how to take the next steps towards making a purchase or appointment, it can take something more extreme to convince a bored viewer to pay attention and seriously consider taking another step. A distinct CTA button as a content format feature can also be easier for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\">mobile viewers</a> to find. </p>\r\n<h2>Discover how we can help your CTA make an impact on your practice</h2>\r\n<p>Whether this is the first article you have read on CTAs or the 400th, Doctor Genius is here to help.

Although search engine providers do not reveal specific algorithms to the public, the artificial intelligence tools used in programming provide a more specific search experience for users. SEO content creators must take new algorithm changes into account when mapping out <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/\">future strategies</a> to avoid getting stuck with outdated methods and losing vital search ranking positions. </p>\r\n<h2>Neural matching and SEO strategizing</h2>\r\n<p>Modern techniques in search engine content formatting benefit both service providers and search engine users by making it easier to make a connection between the two groups. When formulating a strategy for keyword optimization, SEO content creators should utilize new techniques. </p>\r\n<h3>How does neural matching work? </h3>\r\n<p>Unlike more outdated artificial intelligence, the AI used in neural matching dives deeper into the reasoning behind searches to better analyze the user&#8217;s thought process and retrieve more meaningful and relevant content. By using a more thorough AI analysis, the search engine taps into a more diverse database of content. More diverse content retrieval means the user is more likely to connect with the sought-after results instead of more superficial, though related, content.</p>\r\n<p>To simplify the process, neural matching allows the search engine to better understand what the user is trying to find, resulting in more relevant content. The easiest way for these algorithms to diversify the search is to not only pull in content that has exact or closely related keywords to the user&#8217;s search input but also synonyms to those keywords and the associated content. The reasoning behind pulling in this related information is to help the user reach the intended result even if the search terms were not a perfect match. </p>\r\n<h3>How does neural matching affect SEO strategies? </h3>\r\n<p>Search engines utilizing AI that better understand the reasoning behind a user&#8217;s search keywords leads to a more personalized user experience. To fall in line with a more customized search and maintain high search engine rankings, SEO content writers must adapt to the use of neural matching algorithms. Traditional SEO features strategically-placed keywords and phrases as a part of content formatting.</p>\r\n<p>One of the key adaptation techniques is to anticipate the related keywords the algorithm pulls into searches and integrate them into the writing as well. Using this strategy helps the algorithm make more intelligent connections between keywords and their synonyms without affecting rankings. If a site&#8217;s ranking does slip as search engines adjust, the effect is likely temporary and can be mitigated by using a slightly modified SEO strategy. </p>\r\n<h2>Learn about the latest marketing strategies</h2>\r\n<p>Being able to adjust your current SEO and marketing strategies is the key to remaining relevant in the search engine ranking game.

A surprising amount of information about the health of the rest of the body can be revealed through the mouth. A checkup from a Complete Health dentist also involves screening for conditions such as oral cancer and periodontal disease. Although Complete Health is a dental philosophy, there are also medical practices in which general practitioners choose to perform simple procedures rather than referring patients to specialty practitioners.</p>\r\n<p>There are also SEO advantages to expanding your practice in unexpected directions. Patients looking for the additional services you offer may be more likely to find you if they are listed on your website or mentioned in blogs or social media posts. However, while your medical marketing materials should include the services you do perform, it should also identify the services for which you will have to refer patients to other doctors.</p>\r\n<h2>Why is it important to mention services you do not cover?</h2>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians describes the often nostalgic view of <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0900/p33.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0900/p33.html\">general practitioners</a> in the &#8220;old days&#8221; performing all types of medicine. Back then, referring patients to other doctors was not practical and sometimes not even possible. In today&#8217;s world, you cannot do everything related to the practice of medicine, and it is not reasonable to expect it. However, it is to your advantage, and the patients&#8217; benefit, to explain what you do not do.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Communicating honestly</h3>\r\n<p>Successful communication between provider and patient depends on honesty. However, a <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1137\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1137\">survey in the Journal of Health Affairs</a> revealed that a significant portion of the 1,891 respondents admitted to dishonesty in communication with patients, with 20% concealing medical errors and nearly half giving exaggeratedly positive prognoses. Explaining to your patients what you do not do upfront helps lay the foundation for honest communication.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Building a brand</h3>\r\n<p>Thanks to online information from health care websites and review apps, patients tend to be more informed before reaching the doctor&#8217;s office than ever before. This can work to your advantage if you want to be known as the doctor that treats such-and-such conditions in your area. For balance, your brand marketing should include what you do not do as well as what you do.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Managing patients&#8217; expectations</h3>\r\n<p>Patients choose health care providers not only on the basis of medical information but on the advice of family and friends. In many cases, referrals from existing patients represent a sizable portion of new patients. Therefore, one negative experience for a patient who was confused and frustrated about the services you do and do not provide could put a significant dent in your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>How do you communicate which areas require referrals?</h2>\r\n<p>In addition to communicating honestly with patients, you should also be clear in how your relay what services need to be referred. Be sure they are delineated from the services you do provide with an unambiguously worded, eye-catching header.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn effective and responsible medical marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Your medical marketing should adhere to the same standards of responsibility and ethics as the rest of your practice.
