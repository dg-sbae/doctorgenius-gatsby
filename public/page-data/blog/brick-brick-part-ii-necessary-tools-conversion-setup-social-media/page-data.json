Those numbers only continue to rise as social media becomes a dominating presence in the digital landscape. Companies and private practices alike are all using social media to reach social media users and convert them into patients/customers. Known as conversion, Doctor Genius has the right tools to help accomplish this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Engaging social media users</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While people believe that using a social media account is fairly easy, effectively using one to convert users into patients is exceedingly difficult. Hubspot finds that in 2017, approximately 74 percent of people use Facebook for professional purposes. Statista states that Facebook had 1.13 billion daily active users in 2016. Social media is a thriving platform for medical professionals to reach potential patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hootsuite.com defines conversion rate as “a positive action that is taken on a website by a visitor from social media,” adding that “The action demonstrates that the visitor is “converting” into a customer.” Even with a website, ranking high on search result is not an easy task. With how busy many medical professionals can get, maintaining a social media account can become exceedingly difficult. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can work to provide regular posts to engage followers on different social media accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engaging users on a regular basis is necessary for a social media account to reach potential patients and hold relevance on users’ feeds. In other words, if a social media page does not continue to make new posts and share content on a regular basis, people are less likely to even notice it in their feed. However, posting on a regular basis is only the first step.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Converting social media users into patients</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Necessary Tools for Conversion\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-931\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">Social Media Examiner found that in 2015, around 90 percent of all marketers using social media, generated more exposure for their business.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Posting content on social media is important but it is even more crucial to post content that brings users to a professional’s website.

Medical professionals need accurate and engaging information that reaches out to potential patients and captivates them. However, there are several other purposes for online content outside of being a source of information that portrays a message.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Including keywords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Keywords are a particular word or phrase that help a website rank on search engine results. When someone is in need of a specific medical service, he or she will type in a specific phrase or set of words. We can measure which sets of phrases are more common than others and use them within the content of your website. While keywords can help a website rank, they are not enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keeping a website active</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>HubSpot states that about 53 percent of marketers say that blog content creation is their top inbound marketing priority in 2017. By creating, customizing and posting blogs on a monthly basis, we help to keep your website active and appearing on Google’s radar. This helps Google to see that the lights are still on at home and place your website on the search results. By including these steps and other tools, we can help increase the rank of a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Targeting specific audiences</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We can create content that targets specific demographics and age groups of potential patients. After all, HubSpot found that in 2016, about 43 percent of people admitted to only skimming blog posts. It is no surprise that people are not always going to just stumble onto a blog post from a medical professional’s website. Thus, Doctor Genius will create custom content that targets specific audiences to bring in more website views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With titles and phrases that advertise a specific service, we can help identify the most popular demographic to reach. However, there are other ways to help a blog or website appear in search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Effective Online Content\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-945\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">In 2015, eMarketer found that 8 out of 10 marketers worldwide use location targeting in mobile advertising.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Geo-Targeting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Verge, states that in May of 2017, Google has more than 2 billion monthly active devices on Android. Monthly, Google has over 1 billion people using Chrome, Maps and Search. By creating mobile first websites, we can help our clients reach patients over multiple digital platforms. More importantly, we can target people by area. Geo targeting allows us to customize and build content for people in a specific area. With geo targeting, we help our clients reach areas surrounding the zip code they practice in, as opposed to only reaching residents directly nearby.</p>\r\n<p>By using Doctor Genius, you can feel assured in knowing that we are attempting to reach potential patients through multiple electronic devices in surrounding areas for a better chance at a higher ranking and more patients.

Without a strong foundation, the website will never accomplish what it sets out to do and much like the foundation of a house built on sand, it will fail under pressure. While DIY services make creating and maintaining a website easy, there is always someone working on the website’s code through the back door. However, it can be difficult to find a service specializing in website maintenance and design, while also specializing in content for various medical professions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Start off with a strong foot forward</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we strive to create an effective website with quality content pertaining to the client’s profession. From the first meeting, our team works with the client to create a website that meets the client’s needs and Google’s search engine specifications. One of the biggest factors to help a website rank high up near the top of search results is using keywords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keywords are terms or phrases that pertain to the client’s area of expertise and ranks highly due to popularity on search engines. A search engine will target keywords, to sum up the page and help direct people to the page. For instance, a dentist who uses the keyword “Teeth Whitening,” will be able to attract people to the website who are searching for that term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, keywords are only one of the first steps to building an effective website. We can help our clients start off with a strong foot forward with several crucial factors, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Constant website maintenance</li>\r\n \t<li>Technology to review ranking traffic</li>\r\n \t<li>Mobile-First website</li>\r\n \t<li>Regular website backups</li>\r\n \t<li>Call tracking system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>We are here to help every step of the way</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-26-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"A Website Built Strong From the Start\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-919\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-26-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-26-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-26-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Doctor Genius will provide the information about your website that you need on a regular basis, when you need it.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we do not stop after developing a website and continue to work with the client every step of the way.
