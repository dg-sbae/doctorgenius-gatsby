One<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>During COVID-19, digital marketing is more valuable since more people are staying home and using digital devices more frequently. One way to continue patient acquisition during the pandemic is through online content that increases the chance of social sharing. Social sharing occurs when website visitors share your content on their social platform. This means that a website visitor found your content valuable or inspirational enough for them to want to share it with others on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. </p>\r\n<p>Social shares can noticeably improve the reputation of your practice and the ability to attract visitors who have commercial intent. Finding prospective patients through offline channels is more challenging during COVID-19, so increasing the chance of being found on social media through sharing posts is a great way to limit the financial impact that the pandemic has on your practice.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, there are ways to improve your practice’s chance of receiving social shares. </p>\r\n<h2>The Importance of social sharing</h2>\r\n<p>Content generation is a great way to increase organic traffic to your practice’s website during COVID-19, as well as long-term traffic. Within content marketing are additional marketing goals. The ideal result from content is not just increased traffic but also improved brand recognition and more conversions. One way to achieve this is through more social shares. </p>\r\n<p>Making social sharing a priority is one way that practices can get the most out of their content and weather the storm during the pandemic. The more social shares that a blog post, image, or another form of content gets, the more quality exposure it will receive from prospective patients.</p>\r\n<p>Also, traffic received through social sharing is typically more valuable than traffic directly from search engines. Social sharing means the website visitor found the content through the referral of someone they trust on social media.</p>\r\n<h3>Increasing patient acquisitions through social sharing</h3>\r\n<p>The ultimate goal of content marketing is to increase conversions. Social sharing is a great way to achieve higher conversion rates by improving brand recognition and reaching more prospective clients with valuable content. Social sharing is similar to word of mouth. Word-of-mouth referrals are trusted, typically due to the patient having a quality experience with your practice and telling others about it.</p>\r\n<p>Social sharing works in a similar way. Website visitors who find quality content on your website will want to share it with others through social media. In a similar way as word of mouth, this is often a valuable referral that can improve brand and reputation and ultimately lead to an increase in patient acquisition. During COVID-19, it gives practices a chance to further their marketing goals and continue reaching prospective patients. </p>\r\n<h3>How to encourage and increase social sharing</h3>\r\n<p>There are simple content marketing strategies that practices can implement to increase the chance of receiving social shares. Perhaps most notably, quality content is essential. Visitors are far more likely to share content that they find valuable, intriguing, and inspirational. You can attract the reader’s attention through direct and detailed content and attention-grabbing titles and headers. </p>\r\n<p>It is also essential to have easily accessible share buttons for each piece of content on your website. This encourages the reader to share because they can do so quickly. Another simple and easy tip is to simply ask for a social share, which can be as easy as a short call to action at the end of each piece of content. </p>\r\n<h2>Develop a content strategy with Doctor Genius</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 presents a unique challenge for many practices.

These clinics are screening and testing patients. The offices also refer them to emergency rooms when necessary. The pandemic has forced urgent care facilities to change the way they operate for the time being. Steps are being taken to protect employees and patients during this difficult time.</p>\r\n<h2>Urgent care on the frontlines of COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Urgent care facilities currently have two main objectives for COVID-19. First, the facilities want to limit the spread of this highly contagious disease. Second, the facilities want to ensure that sick patients receive the necessary treatment. To accomplish both objectives, offices have changed business models for the time being.</p>\r\n<h3>Telehealth screenings</h3>\r\n<p>Urgent care facilities realize that reducing the number of patients in waiting rooms is vital. Having fewer people in waiting rooms slows the spread of the disease. Many urgent care offices use online screening and telehealth to determine if people are likely to have coronavirus. Those who do not pass the screening might have to go to a testing facility instead of the office.</p>\r\n<h3>Limiting the time in waiting rooms</h3>\r\n<p>Many urgent care offices are also allowing patients to wait in vehicles in the parking lot after checking in. Also, many are offering curbside service. These practices reduce the time spent in the waiting room. The methods protect patients and providers.</p>\r\n<h3>Providing masks when necessary</h3>\r\n<p>Some urgent care facilities provide protective masks for patients. Patients can call ahead before going to the appointment. The screening takes place during the call. Then, a staff member meets the patient at the door and provides the mask if needed. As an added precaution, these facilities also wipe down the door handles and everything else the patient touches.</p>\r\n<h3>Ruling out other conditions</h3>\r\n<p>Urgent care centers are also playing a vital role in providing flu tests for patients. Many people who think they have coronavirus have seasonal flu. After consulting with the provider, patients can come in for the flu test. If the flu test comes back negative, the facility might recommend a coronavirus test.</p>\r\n<h3>Dealing with overflow patients</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has overwhelmed medical facilities. Some states allow retired providers to join the fight against the disease. These providers do not need to undergo the recertification process. This puts them on the frontlines now. Hospitals need this to meet current patient demand.</p>\r\n<p>Urgent care facilities help overwhelmed hospitals by providing other types of care. For example, patients with urinary tract infections or animal bites can visit the urgent care facility. This takes the strain from the overburdened hospitals. It also makes it easier for hospitals to care for COVID-19 patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Urgent care facilities are part of the team fighting COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Urgent care facilities always play an important role in health care. That role is on the frontlines during the COVID-19 crisis. Many facilities have changed business practices for the time being. These facilities also take the burden off overwhelmed hospitals. With urgent care facilities on the frontlines, the system runs smoother. This helps everyone receive the necessary care.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

After all, you have so<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>During the COVID-19 crisis, you might feel an urge to abandon your social media pages. After all, you have so many other things to focus on, including patient care. Your social media channel is actually an important part of patient care during this pandemic. As a trusted provider, your patients and other members of the community count on your social media channel now more than ever. Find out how you can use social media marketing for good during the pandemic.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep people informed during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Medical and dental practices always want patients to be healthy. This is even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Misinformation runs rampant online, and providers can cut through the noise to ensure patients know the facts. This is easy to do when using social media.</p>\r\n<h3>Advocate for social distancing</h3>\r\n<p>Many people do not understand the importance of social distancing or even what the phrase “flatten the curve” means. However, many listen to community health care providers. Providers can use social media channels, including Facebook and Twitter, to educate patients. Healthcare providers have influence over the people who follow them. Using that influence during a pandemic is critical for the common good and health of Americans.</p>\r\n<h3>Help people who need to get tested</h3>\r\n<p>With flu and allergy season colliding with the coronavirus, there is a great deal of confusion about who needs to be tested. People are sneezing and coughing their way through the season, and many do not know if they have the virus. Health care providers can use social media channels to explain the symptoms of the virus. Then, people will know if those sneezes and coughs are just allergies, the flu, or something more serious.</p>\r\n<p>Also, providers can give directions for people to follow. Do readers need to visit a provider? Should patients try telemedicine? Maybe social media followers need to self-isolate. Providing this information takes the burden off emergency rooms and urgent care facilities. It also helps people stay healthy.</p>\r\n<h3>Show the steps that the practice is taking to keep people healthy</h3>\r\n<p>People are afraid and want to be reassured. That includes knowing that medical practices and dental offices are taking proper precautions to combat the spread of COVID-19. Practices are encouraged to use social media to explain how they are keeping the office clean and free of contamination. That can include sanitation practices and screening policies.</p>\r\n<h3>Educate about telemedicine</h3>\r\n<p>While the world is focused on COVID-19, Americans still deal with other health issues. Some have high blood pressure, while others take medications that must be monitored. Practices can use social media to educate the public about telemedicine as a viable option. Many people are excited to embrace telemedicine instead of exposing themselves while at an office.</p>\r\n<h2>Make social media part of your public outreach strategy</h2>\r\n<p>Public outreach is more important than ever before. Your patients are nervous and unsure of what to expect. Many will turn to you for advice and information. Speak directly to them through your social media channels. By providing resources and information, you can help limit the spread and ensure that people receive the necessary treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
