The journey of the potential patient usually begins with an internet search that factor in online reviews, what insurance guidelines the patient has to follow and geographical location. If a website does not cater to those search parameters, then the website will have trouble attracting a steady flow of new patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Understanding the patient’s journey</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to understand the mindset of the potential patient who is in need of dental care. While advertising specific types of services on a website can be beneficial, professionals need a website that can effectively display those services in an easy-to-navigate manner. Patients need to feel that they can trust what the website states to a certain degree. Thus, reviews about the medical practice hold a certain amount of influence over people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Ryan Erskine highlights statistics in a Forbes article, which states that 90 percent of consumers read online reviews before visiting a business. While people may be able to sense when a review is fake or the individual is over exaggerating, there are still many people who trust reviews to a certain degree. Thus, having a website that links to reviews and having professionals recommend patients leave reviews will help to promote their practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While reviews are an important part of what people consider when searching for a practice, location also influences where they will go. Many people will merely type in the name of their city and the type of care they need to start the search. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help ensure that a specific practice appears within the different map apps and for the search phrase, “City, Dentist.”</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb1-1-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1123\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb1-1-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb1-1-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb1-1-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">The Forbes article adds that 91 percent of adults use search engines online to find information on the web.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Proper website presentation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to stand out among the masses on Google search results, professionals need a quality website service that continues maintenance and updates to the website. Doctor Genius does both of these things and more, applying skills and necessary tools to the foundation of the website. At Doctor Genius, we build a website with the potential patient’s focus in mind. We know where to place the correct terms, information and content people want immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our team understands that when people are considering calling a medical practice, they are searching for the surface level of information. After finding the basic information, patients may begin to look at the rest of the website to find quality content that breaks down the practice’s services. While each patient is different, there tends to be a similar search routine for medical care. Insurance also plays a significant role in selecting a medical practice. We can help the professional determine how much or little about the subject they want to place on their website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Call us for more information today.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

In an online market with multiple products available, there are numerous situations in which professionals invest in an online tool and are unsure of how to truly utilize it. For instance, having a tool that identifies effective keywords is only effective when someone knows how to apply those results to the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, Doctor Genius has the knowledge necessary to utilize specific online tools to help get your professional website more traffic. This 5-part blog series summarizes a few of the tools that we employ in our packages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>SEO Keywords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic function of a professional website is to advertise a service or group of services in order to reach consumers. The effective method for keeping people on a website is to provide content covering services or related topics. However, there are thousands of resources online that can appear higher up on a Google search over our clients. Thus, we insert SEO keywords into text that will help the website appear higher up the search list.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Call Tracking</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For many private medical practices, having a working phone number is an important part of the appointment process. No matter how much information is on a website, there is always a need for patients to call the office. However, professionals do not keep track of all phone calls and what source generated them. A call tracking system can measure which ads or web pages are bringing in the greatest amount of traffic. This way, we can shift focus from one aspect to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb6-2-blog.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1126\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb6-2-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb6-2-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/study-feb6-2-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">The Pew Research Center states that at least 77 percent of U.S. adults own a smartphone.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overloading a Website with Content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is important to have content on a website, simply flooding a website with content or copying more content onto a website will cause issues instead of benefits. Along with that is the fact that content needs to include topics and keywords that can help boost Google search list rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile First vs. Mobile Responsive</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A mobile first website is when we create the mobile version of a website so that it appears on a phone screen without causing other issues. After creating the website for phones and tablets, we will then create the website for the desktop, as well. This way, you can have a website that appears properly on all devices without cutting off page content or causing other issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

This untapped market makes up about 75.4 million people according to the Government Census in 2015. However, the census also states that millennials are much more diverse and use various forms of technology for seeking medical care as opposed to traditional methods. Fortunately, Doctor Genius has an event about how to reach this untapped market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Marketing to millennials</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With technological advances, more and more people use cellphones or tablets instead of their computer. At this point, laptops and traditional desktop computers are becoming less of a mainstay in homes. While having a website can help a medical practice reach potential patients, millennials are less likely to search the web and more likely to use social media and apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, Doctor Genius is hosting the event: Marketing to Millennials on March 15, 2018 at the Residence Inn by Marriott Santa Clarita Valencia from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. with dinner included. This event can also add up to 3 CE credits for attendees. For more information on the event or to register, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/events/marketing-millennials-03152018/\">click here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical professionals may not realize that 85 percent of millennials use a smartphone, which grants them access to web browsers, social media platforms, apps and more. Due to this, it is less likely that people will pull out their laptop or computer every night. Medical professionals need a mobile-first website that can adjust to the screen size of the device. Part of marketing to millennials involves reaching them on their highly-mobile digital platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1113\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">5 in 6 millennials connect to businesses via social media.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reaching patients through other digital platforms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media may have started out as a platform for friends to communicate with each other, but has now become a platform for much more. Businesses of all kinds can use social media to reach out to loyal customers and new consumers with active posts. Medical professionals can link to their website through social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the PEW Research Center found in August of 2017 that two-thirds of Americans reported that they got at least some of their news from social media. People are seeking information on these platforms instead of searching for the specific medical service online. Our event will take the time to go over tips and techniques for utilizing these platforms to reach new patients. We can also offer methods for patient retention and maintaining these patients for years to come.
