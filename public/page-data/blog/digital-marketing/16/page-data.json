With multiple options for almost every medical practice in a single city, the competition can get fierce. While patients can utilize free website builders for a quick one-page site, they do not have the skills or internet know-how to continue maintenance on a website.\r\n\r\n<h3>The tools are only as useful as the skills of the holder</h3>\r\n\r\nAs any medical professional will know, having the tools and knowing how to properly use them are two entirely different things. A dentist can have the latest technology, but lack the skills for the proper use. It is the same way with creating an online platform to display one’s practice. At Doctor Genius, our clients are skilled medical professionals who put in the time for the credentials, but do not necessarily have the prowess to keep an effective online presence.\r\n\r\nAn example of a new tool that has pros and cons is the Website Builder available on Google My Business. In an article on searchengineland.com, Senior SEO Manager and Columnist Tony Edward, reviews the new builder. While this builder can help professionals create a one-page website, there are several cons to the process, including only offering a “One-page site, no option to create additional pages,” Edward writes.\r\n\r\nEdward also finds that there is no ability to add custom page titles, no analytics integration and no ability to add call-to-action buttons. With other cons in the article, it is apparent that this new website builder will not benefit anyone searching for a website that can continue to rank, bring in new patients and continue to expand over time. Doctor Genius can offer the website platform while also providing the services to help truly enhance a practice.\r\n\r\n<h3>We can make the process easy</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-630\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> While this builder can help professionals create a one-page website, there are several cons to the process, including only offering a “One-page site, no option to create additional pages,” Edward writes.</p></div>\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we have a team of web developers, designers and support technicians on-site to help keep our clients’ websites running smoothly and bringing in new patients.

Social media is becoming an effective tool for professionals of any field to reach clients.  However, professionals need the social media know-how to navigate the system and gain more patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A strong presence in social media</h3>\r\nFrom Pinterest to Twitter, dental professionals are able to interact with patients and share information about their services online. Social media can give professionals an opportunity to offer their services, promotions and information to potential patients with the click of a button. Twitter is one such platform that allows for quick bits of information.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, the PEW Research Center found in a group of 1,520 adults, 79 percent used Facebook as their main social media platform. Meanwhile, CNN writes on money.cnn.com that Facebook is climbing toward 2 billion active users as of the end of 2016. With the variety of content that people post on any social media platform, there are a variety of tools that people use online. One such tool is known as the hashtag that helps people find the post more easily than before.\r\n\r\nIn another study of the PEW Research Center, they explain that “The hashtag symbol (#) is used before keywords to categorize tweets and helps facilitate searches within Twitter.” By using the hashtag symbol, professionals can help patients find a specific post about dental care. Examples can include #DentalCheckups or #ProfessionalTeethCleaning. The PEW Research Center also finds that “Clicking on a hashtag will show all the tweets in a category.”\r\n\r\nTwitter is beneficial for a quick and small post that appeals to patients who do not need or want a lot of information. However, attaching any word to a hashtag symbol does not guarantee that more people will read the post.\r\n<h3>Let Doctor Genius enhance your practice</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-548\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we understand the mechanics of social media, utilizing Facebook and Twitter to promote a client’s practice. While Facebook is extremely popular, people will frequent other platforms online for various reasons. The PEW Research Center also found that in 2011, around 57 percent of all tweets from The Daily Caller and 21 percent of all tweets from the Washington Post used the hashtag symbol.\r\n\r\nWhile the hashtag symbol can be effective, we will not flood every single tweet, Facebook post or comment with hashtags. We have a team of professionals who can help create, customize and continually monitor online content to ensure that our clients get quality service. Social media has more tools and methods for promoting one’s practice to potential patients. We strive to help our clients’ Facebook pages appear on other people’s feeds, while also reaching out on Twitter.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in more information or in seeking our services, feel free to give us a call. #Specializedonlinecontent\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

You went to medical school and got the degrees. You opened a practice. Now, you are using every possible method to build your practice. However, no matter what methods you try, there is an apparent lack of new patients. No matter what you attempt, there seem to be fewer and fewer patients walking through the door of your practice. Fortunately, we have the solution through our Online Marketing Services at Doctor Genius.\r\n\r\n<h3>More than just online marketing</h3>\r\n\r\nAfter asking 4,500 marketing and sales professionals, Hubspot.com found that 65 percent of these professionals stated that generating traffic and leads for their company was the most difficult step. It is easy for a company to throw terms such as “local search” at possible clients and not provide effective services. In many cases, dentists will look for a company to help enhance or build a website, by comparing the price. In reality, dentists need to compare performance rather than price.\r\n\r\nFollowing the mortgage market failing in 2008, small mortgage companies throughout the United States began going out of business and closing their doors. Thus, the industry for local online marketing began really taking off. With so many companies offering marketing services, professionals struggle to find a credible service.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we pride ourselves on performance and building a relationship with the clients to promote their practice. Unlike other companies that may run online marketing techniques in the beginning, but not have the client’s interest at heart, Doctor Genius strives to bring a client’s desires to fruition. Doctor Genius will work with the client from day one to create a mobile-friendly platform for the clients’ private practice.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-529\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Building a reliable connection with clients</h3>\r\n\r\nWe strive to set up a positive relationship with clients by implementing the client’s requests into a mobile-friendly website. At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Create informative content using Google’s current algorithm changes</li>\r\n \t<li>Develop pages from the needs and requests of clients</li>\r\n \t<li>Help keep the website active with monthly blog posts</li>\r\n \t<li>Help funnel traffic from search engines to the website</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWith the available payment plans, the price will not need to be as large of a concern as with other services. Whatever the price may be, Doctor Genius will provide the performance necessary to help a private practice reach success. If we can help clients receive between 25 to 50 new patient inquiries every single month, then the price should not prevent owners from promoting their private practices.\r\n\r\nOur results help clients build trust with us in understanding that we provide more than placing specific terms on a digital platform. We build the website and work with the client to create a website that represents their practices. You can feel confident in knowing that we will help accurately represent your practice’s vision and mission statement online.\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

With the digital market growing and becoming a prominent factor for all types of businesses, it is crucial for a business to maximize their online presence. This statistic applies to private dental practices as well as various forms of shopping, with more people reading reviews online, researching practice websites, comparing procedure rates and locations before scheduling an appointment.\r\n<h3>Oh, the platforms your practice will end up on</h3>\r\nWhen possible patients search for a practice online, the location is one of the key factors in making a decision. In fact, a common search term is “professional dentist near me.” Thus, many possible patients will end up on Google Maps, searching for a practice near their location that will accept their insurance.\r\n\r\nIn an article written by Raj Nijjer and posted on geomarketing.com, Nijjer lists four ways to drive in-store traffic with Google Maps. The four steps are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Be there when people search for you on Google</li>\r\n \t<li>Happy customers make great promoters</li>\r\n \t<li>Pictures show what’s exceptional</li>\r\n \t<li>Give people an insider view</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAlthough these steps seem basic, they are fundamental in helping to promote a private practice. Google Maps has the ability to display more than simply the location of a company, so companies need to utilize all possible tools. Include the basics on a Google Maps profile with hours, practice title and any promotion deals available. By giving patients a location and images of an actual property, it validates the practice by making it a real website for the patient.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-422\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h3>You control how potential patients see your practice</h3>\r\n<h5>In 2013, GE Capital Retail Bank’s Second Annual Shopper Study found that 81 percent of shoppers research online before visiting the actual store.</h5>\r\nWhile a practice cannot control the thoughts or reactions of patients online and in the office, a practice can control the image that they present online. As Nijjer stated, “Happy customers make great promoters.” Reviews are a crucial part of the decision-making process. While the patient can write whatever they feel like writing, a positive review will go a long way to helping bring new patients into the practice.\r\n\r\nIt is also crucial to respond to a negative review with a professional answer. People may search for a negative review to figure out if the review is real or false. The review needs to have a name and cannot be anonymous. It can also beneficial for the practice to respond to the client’s review.\r\n\r\nAlong with providing patient feedback online, a practice can also provide professional photos of the practice. Similar to how a restaurant produces photos of signature dishes and the dining area, a private dental practice will benefit from posting professional photos of the dental chairs, machinery, waiting room and more.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Doctor Genius can help to provide the digital platform for a private practice and provide quality control for the practice’s website. We will create a new website for the practice and help the practice maintain an active presence online.

When people hear a company or service mention Search Engine Optimization, SEO, many automatically assume that it is black magic or a hat full of cheap parlor tricks. At Doctor Genius, we have no ulterior motives or cheap tricks hidden up our sleeves. With the proper SEO services backing up a practice, the owner of the practice will experience an increase of influence and reach in the digital landscape.\r\n<h3>The need to know about SEO</h3>\r\nOne main tip that can help clients understand SEO is that there is no shortcut to success. Any SEO service that states a website only needs more keywords to reach a larger audience or to purchase more links is not truly going to help the company’s website. Google recently posted a video on the subject of hiring an SEO company, presented by Developer Programs Tech Lead, Maile Ohye.\r\n\r\nOhye covers several key factors that people need to search for when considering investing in SEO services. The truth is that an SEO company can only do so much with any given website.  “An SEO’s potential is only as high as the quality of your business or website,” Ohye states. Ohye also highlights the fact that an SEO company “Looks to improve the entire searcher experience” from “search results to clicking on your website and potentially converting.” A few services that can help clients achieve this through the use of SEO services include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>A mobile-friendly website</li>\r\n \t<li>Good navigation</li>\r\n \t<li>Tools to build a great brand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt takes time for an SEO company, such as Doctor Genius, to develop or enhance a website and lead to a positive increase in the client’s practice. In fact, as Ohye states, SEO companies need “four months to a year to help your business first implement improvements and then see potential benefits.” Another key component for any company to consider when investing in SEO is that the entire company needs to be committed to the SEO improvements.\r\n<h5><em>“An SEO’s potential is only as high as the quality of your business or website,” –Maile Ohye</em></h5>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/piSvFxV_M04\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<h3>Put in the effort to watch a company grow</h3>\r\nWith a multitude of methods for improving a company’s online presence through SEO, there are also factors to get the best use out of SEO. Other tips for possible clients who are wary of investing in SEO services that Ohye states include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Conducting a two-way interview between the SEO company and the client</li>\r\n \t<li>Being prepared to answer some questions about one’s business that the SEO company may ask</li>\r\n \t<li>Being prepared to receive feedback from an audit on the company and the rates for improving specific areas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we build clients a new website and cover many more aspects than simply placing keywords in the right places. As Ohye states in her video, one of our main goals is to help clients identify their target patient demographic and track how those patients search specific terms online. We use honest methods to help our clients rank online with quality content.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most. Digital marketing can help your practice adapt and grow in the aftermath of COVID-19.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Are Here to Help </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unsure if your dental practice is ready for the digital landscape, we can help.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
