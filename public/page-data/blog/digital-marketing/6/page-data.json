Clients rely heavily on reviews and site content when choosing a new provider. Separating your practice from similar ones may come down to content design and website readability. Keeping things such as language and sentence structure simple may not only boost your SEO ranking, but it can also capture more business. Find out how keeping things simple can make all the difference when trying to attract more clients.</p>\r\n<h2>Readers have a short attention span</h2>\r\n<p>The world runs at a quick pace, and building a practice page that caters to this is imperative. With the demands of work and family obligations, readers do not want to spend time conducting extensive research to find a provider. Websites that present information in a concise and precise manner tend to top the list in search results, in part due to the ease with which readers can get the information they want. The quicker visitors find what is needed from your site, the more likely they are to return or, better yet, make an appointment. Simplifying website content to make it user-friendly may result in more conversions than you might think.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing tools that simplify content</h2>\r\n<p>A website has only a few seconds to grab a potential client&#8217;s attention and keep them on the page. One way to do this is by creating content that is user friendly, eye-catching, and relevant. Using a more simplistic writing style is beneficial as it tends to reach a wider audience and keep them engaged longer.</p>\r\n<h3>Short sentences</h3>\r\n<p>For a medical practice, you may believe that using an elevated vocabulary and complex sentence structure makes you sound like more of an expert. However, these things lead to fewer conversions because visitors cannot get the message fast enough. Long sentences can prove hard to follow and process. When readers need to read something more than once to understand it, they will likely move on to another site.</p>\r\n<h3>Headings</h3>\r\n<p>With the barrage of information available on the internet, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">readers tend to skim articles</a> to find what they want. Making content easy to scan is crucial for keeping readers engaged with your practice&#8217;s website. Shorter sentences are faster to read. Paragraph headers make finding information at a glance easier by breaking up content in a concise and organized fashion. Headings, along with short sentences, make navigating a webpage for relevant insight quicker.</p>\r\n<h3>Graphics</h3>\r\n<p>People like visually appealing web pages. Using graphics on your practice&#8217;s page allows potential clients a peek inside your office. Pictures can also draw the eye to other areas you wish to highlight. According to <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm\">washington.edu</a>, website graphics should:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Guide readers to focus on essential portions of the text</li>\r\n\t<li>Conform to the design of the site</li>\r\n\t<li>Not bog the site down with longer loading times</li>\r\n\t<li>Not take away from the content of the page</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Help is at the ready</h2>\r\n<p>The task of creating relevant and easily digestible content for your practice&#8217;s website may feel overwhelming, but we can help.

Since then, however, search technology has evolved to incorporate artificial intelligence, which enables the search engine to deliver the most accurate results based on several variables, with keywords being just one of them. Google refers to this new and improved search as “semantic search” and scores websites based on their “semantic distance.”</p>\r\n<h2>The introduction of semantic search</h2>\r\n<p>Semantic search is not a new idea, though many brands are only just now incorporating the concept into their content marketing strategies. Back in 2013, Google realized that because <a href=\"https://envato.com/blog/semantic-search/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://envato.com/blog/semantic-search/\">people communicate through conversations, not keywords</a>, it was time to make some serious changes. As a result, it released the Hummingbird algorithm, which was designed to improve the search engine’s understanding of users’ search queries and deliver more accurate results faster.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike previous algorithms, which returned results based solely on keywords, Hummingbird understood that words have multiple meanings. Thus, it used AI to gather information about a user’s location, search history, spelling, and context to better understand the intent behind a search term. Google then used this data to quickly analyze full questions and rank results based on a particular user’s previously indexed content. Content that ranks higher is deemed to have a better “semantic score.”</p>\r\n<h2>Improving your semantic distance score</h2>\r\n<p>Regardless of industry, optimizing content for semantic search is essential. However, because you are in the medical field, it is even more so for your content.</p>\r\n<p>One of the simplest ways to optimize your medical content for semantic search is by using potential patients’ natural language. Medical professionals use highly technical language that is difficult to understand, much less spell or pronounce. Moreover, the medical field is replete with clinical jargon and acronyms with which the average person is unfamiliar. For instance, as a dentist, you may refer to a deep cleaning as “dental prophylaxis.” However, chances are low that anyone other than another dental professional searches for a dentist by that term. By simply describing these services as “teeth cleaning,” you can drastically expand your audience base.</p>\r\n<p>However, improving your semantic score is not as simple as speaking your audience’s lingo. Google considers several variables when delivering results. Below are additional <a href=\"https://blog.alexa.com/semantic-search/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://blog.alexa.com/semantic-search/\">strategies you can use to make semantic search work for you</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Create highly targeted and useful content that <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-neural-matching/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-neural-matching/\">turns the keyword into the topic</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Optimize content for featured snippets (e.g., clearly answer questions in your content in concise ways and while targeting long-tail keywords)</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search\">Optimize your content for voice search</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Use companion keywords, linguistic variations, and synonyms</li>\r\n\t<li>Add schema markup, or structured data, to the backend of your content to tell Google what your content is about</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Improve your semantic searchability</h2>\r\n<p>Artificial intelligence may be what makes semantic search possible, but improving the semantic searchability of your site does not have to be so technical. In fact, all you really have to do to succeed with Google’s latest algorithms is to offer highly valuable content.

If you are like many business owners, you<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-building-in-feedback/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>To enable comments or not to enable comments, that is the question. If you are like many business owners, you fear that by adding a comment section to your blog or website, you are inadvertently inviting negative feedback. Negative feedback, especially when shared in such a public way, can adversely affect visitors’ perceptions of your practice or brand. Add to this the fact that enabling comments is time-consuming, as commenters often expect responses, and that it requires moderation to deter junk commenters, you may feel that the answer is obvious: Keep the comments off. However, at Doctor Genius, we encourage you to do the opposite.</p>\r\n<h2>Reasons to incorporate a comment section into your site design</h2>\r\n<p>The marketing world has long been in debate over the whys and why-nots of a comments section on a blog. You can check out the for- and against- arguments on <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/\">Optinmonster</a>, but we want to share our thoughts with you below.</p>\r\n<h3>Build a network</h3>\r\n<p>Content marketing serves three major purposes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>To help your site gain rankings</li>\r\n\t<li>To establish your practice as an authoritative presence</li>\r\n\t<li>To build relationships with current and potential patients</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Allowing feedback enables you to do the third by giving you a way to connect with your followers, to develop relationships based on mutual interests and respect, and to turn an otherwise static piece of content in a living conversation. In short, it allows you to build a network.</p>\r\n<h3>Encourage constructive criticism</h3>\r\n<p>You create content for your audience members, so allow them to make suggestions. Turn the comments section on to encourage feedback regarding an article’s content and to invite ideas for improvement and future topics. This type of constructive criticism gives you a tangible sense of how your audience responds to your content, as well as ways you can improve it so that it resonates positively with the intended recipients.</p>\r\n<h3>Contribute to your SEO</h3>\r\n<p>Many website owners who turn off the comments section fail to take into consideration the SEO value it offers. While a handful of comments is unlikely to make a difference for any given page’s rankings, dozens to hundreds of comments can. How? The reason is two-fold.</p>\r\n<p>First, comments contribute to page length. Second, more words on a page gives it an opportunity to rank for more keywords. To determine whether this contributed to increased search traffic, <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/\">Neil Patel</a> conducted an in-depth study. He found two things to be true.</p>\r\n<p>The first was that, on a comments section that added nearly 4,000 words to a page, approximately 26% of keywords that ranked in Google came from the comments section. The second was that the section garnered approximately 16% of the article’s traffic. Though incorporating feedback into your site design may make more work for you, the results can be well worth it.</p>\r\n<h2>The smart way to enable comments</h2>\r\n<p>A section that encourages feedback can help in multiple other ways, such as keeping your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/\">site live</a>, encouraging customer loyalty, and serving as social proof. Of course, there are the drawbacks to consider, but those become a moot point when you have a dedicated account manager moderating comments, responding to feedback, and, of course, dealing with the back-end issues.

One strategy that many have not heard of focuses on semantic similarity and semantic distance to promote content based on the words themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Natural language processing</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b\">Natural language processing</a> is a tool that search engines use to help find content that matches a specific search. An AI identifies certain words in a section of text that it deems particularly important — more important than the rest of the text. These words are often nouns or pronouns, like names, businesses, numbers, and locations, and the AI picks them out to determine how a webpage should rank with related search terms. A good content writer can take these words and integrate them as relevant SEO keywords, producing a higher rank overall for a website.</p>\r\n<h3>Scoring term frequency</h3>\r\n<p>In every document, those specific words, called entities, can be matched with certain search words. However, not all-important terms in a document identically match someone’s search. The AI&#8217;s score is based on how often a word or term appears in the text. The more it appears, the higher it is ranked in terms of importance. However, if the same word or phrase appears across many texts online, its ranking may get lowered because its popularity indicates it is simply a general term (and is therefore not as important). Balancing these two factors is key in getting the most out of your document terms.</p>\r\n<h3>Scoring semantic similarity</h3>\r\n<p>&#8220;Semantic&#8221; refers to the meaning of words. When ranking similarities between words, natural language processing considers how two words may fall in the same category when compared to words that do not relate to them at all. This process can be helpful for finding websites that are relevant but may not contain the exact words in a user&#8217;s search.</p>\r\n<h3>Reducing semantic distance</h3>\r\n<p>Semantic distance is how far apart two words appear in natural language processing. By using words that relate to each other and so fall into the same categories, a writer can produce content that is more likely to be picked up by search engines looking for similar words. That said, beyond simply identifying content topics, with semantic similarity there is a greater chance of sites being organized and ranked based on content. This can make the rankings more convoluted, which is why including words that are similar to search terms can rank your site higher in regard to both organization and topic.</p>\r\n<h2>Find more ways to reduce semantic distance in your content</h2>\r\n<p>Reducing semantic distance can be a challenge when you do not fully understand how words and terms play into search engine rankings.

Search engine giants like Google have started using<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-view-your-salience-score/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Entity salience is beginning to come to the forefront of website architecture. Search engine giants like Google have started using a salience score to analyze and prioritize search results. To understand how entity salience can help your website perform better in the result rankings and improve search engine optimization, you first have to learn what an entity is and how salience applies to it.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding natural language processing</h2>\r\n<p>Google and other sites use natural language processing to determine the overall meaning of text content on a webpage. This function is carried out by an artificial intelligence program to identify what a real human would find important in a block of text. You can improve content management by focusing on entity salience, though it is important to note that entity salience is not the same thing <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\">as SEO keywords</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Entities</h3>\r\n<p>An entity is usually a specific word in a text that references a noun. For example, a person, a business, a product, and even a number may be recognized as entities within a body of text. A natural language processing AI can identify entities even when they are not specifically named, like when a named person is mentioned again in nominal form. The identification of these entities is the first step toward building a salience score.</p>\r\n<h3>Salience</h3>\r\n<p>When referred to an entity, salience means exactly what its <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience\">Merriam-Webster</a> definition is: being especially noticeable or conspicuous. In text, entities that are salient are those words that the AI detects as being important or prominent to a real person. This does not necessarily mean that someone who reads a website’s content will pick up on all those words. The AI simply uses its estimation of salient entities to create a score of readability and SEO popularity.</p>\r\n<h3>The salience score</h3>\r\n<p>Several factors contribute to how these entities are identified through natural language processing. From a single block of text, an entity may be chosen because of its location in the text, its grammar, if it is linked to sections of the sentence, and how much it stands out. Again, names, nouns, and pronouns all get bonus points in the process. The distinction between entities and keywords is incredibly important to content writers, as a writer can work to incorporate an entity and keyword closely together so that they both rank higher together.</p>\r\n<h2>Calculating your salience score</h2>\r\n<p>Since salience scores are not yet fully popularized and it is not clear how much they may improve website SEO, finding a website to calculate your score can be difficult. Lexalytics and the Google Natural Language API Demo are both options where you can type in text and see how it ranks. By experimenting with different types of texts, you can discover what entities get identified the most and how to write content around salience and SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about salience scores for your website</h2>\r\n<p>There is still a lot that needs to be explored with entity salience. To learn more about how your business can benefit the most from these scores and how to incorporate them into your everyday content, <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">contact us</a> for information and guidance.   </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most. Digital marketing can help your practice adapt and grow in the aftermath of COVID-19.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Are Here to Help </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unsure if your dental practice is ready for the digital landscape, we can help.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
