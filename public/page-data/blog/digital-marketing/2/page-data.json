The amount of trust patients have in your practice, as well as what your practice is worth financially, can have a large impact on its health and growth. Taking a closer look at these can improve both your practice and the experience of your patients. </p>\r\n<h2>Different aspects of brand value</h2>\r\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/stories/innovation/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-2020/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/stories/innovation/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-2020/\">Forbes</a> defines brand value by how much the brand would be worth if it was sold, there is much more that goes into determining that number than just inventory on hand or what is in the bank account. Revenue can sharply increase or decrease based on aspects such as brand authority and brand equity.</p>\r\n<h3>Brand authority</h3>\r\n<p>The level of trust patients have in your practice, as well as the degree to which patients view your practice as providing expert care in your specific field, determines its brand authority. Because this can be very subjective, brand authority can fluctuate quickly. Cure a high-profile patient or master a difficult medical procedure, and your practice will typically earn more brand authority. Cause complications for a well-known patient or get involved in a medical malpractice case and your brand authority will generally plummet. </p>\r\n<h3>Brand equity</h3>\r\n<p>The loyalty of your patients, who your practice is associated with, and how visible your practice is combine to form brand equity. Like brand authority, brand equity can shift quickly because it is subjective. Become associated with a popular medial foundation or heal the mayor, and your practice is likely to get more visibility, thus increasing patient loyalty and, subsequently, brand equity. </p>\r\n<h2>The importance of brand value for patients </h2>\r\n<p>A higher brand value can not only help increase the profitability of your practice, but also assist with improving patient relations. </p>\r\n<h3>Increased patient loyalty</h3>\r\n<p>If the brand authority or brand value of your practice is low, patients tend to be warier about scheduling a procedure and can have negative expectations about their experience. In this case, it is easy for those expectations to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, even if nothing major goes wrong. When brand authority is high, patients are more likely to expect a positive experience at your practice. As long as these expectations are met, you have most likely created a patient for life.</p>\r\n<h3>Faster work in progress times</h3>\r\n<p>Have you ever looked at a stack of unpaid patient statements and wondered what you could do to encourage a faster work in progress time? Building brand authority and value can be part of the solution. Not many patients are rushing to pay the bill from a small, seemingly insignificant practice no one is talking about. However, patients can be more likely to submit payment more quickly for a well-respected practice that is popular in the community. </p>\r\n<h2>Build your brand and your practice</h2>\r\n<p>Building your practice starts with patient acquisition, which our team at Doctor Genius knows all about.

If you are looking to increase<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/why-google-reviews-can-be-more-authentic-than-yelp/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The number of reviews on Google far surpasses those on other local review sites. If you are looking to increase your practice&#8217;s online reviews to appeal to more patients, it is better to focus on Google reviews over Yelp reviews. Here are some reasons to concentrate your efforts on Google reviews.</p>\r\n<h2>A Better Way To Promote a Practice</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571\">BrightLocal</a>, Google reviews can be the way to go when looking to improve SEO ranking. Using the right review platform can make marketing efforts as productive as possible. Reports from <a href=\"https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/\">ReviewTrackers</a> show 63.6% of people check Google reviews before choosing a business to visit. Putting more time into increasing reviews on other platforms may not receive a favorable investment return. As the average star rating on Google is notably higher than on Yelp, a business is more likely to benefit from a higher rating on Google than Yelp. </p>\r\n<h3>Avoid the Negative Impact of Yelp</h3>\r\n<p>The ReviewTrackers report also notes that most people use filters when searching to eliminate any business with less than a four-star rating. Yelp may exclude one&#8217;s practice from search results before even being viewed since it has a lower average rating. In this case, the practice will be affected by a lack of visibility.</p>\r\n<h3>Encourage Patients To Leave Google Reviews</h3>\r\n<p>While not all reviewers will use Google, it can be beneficial to encourage patients to review one&#8217;s practice on the desired platform. Rather than use vague language when asking for a review, mention Google specifically. Most people tend to follow directions, and because Google is a widely popular platform as well as user-friendly, it should be simple for patients to leave a review on Google.</p>\r\n<h3>Add a Direct Link</h3>\r\n<p>Another tip is to add a website link that leads directly to the Google review form. This addition will make it easier for patients to leave reviews on that site instead of having to pull one up by themselves. Many practices send patients an email after treatment or procedures to ensure they are recovering well and are not experiencing any unexpected side effects. Asking specifically for a Google review and adding a direct link in this type of email can remind patients who may have forgotten to leave a Google review.</p>\r\n<h2>Draw Patients in With Positive Reviews</h2>\r\n<p>Our team at Doctor Genius knows how important it is to get good online reviews.

This tactic is particularly helpful for smaller practices because it is less expensive. This kind of marketing takes place naturally over time and can help draw in new patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Generating Website Growth Organically</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/paid-organic-marketing-strategy-blog/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/paid-organic-marketing-strategy-blog/\">Salesforce</a>, organic marketing is an excellent way to increase website traffic and landing page viewership. Instead of paying for ads or sponsored posts, traffic is generated naturally over time through organic marketing. Check out these examples of organic marketing and how it is beneficial.</p>\r\n<h3>Blog Posts</h3>\r\n<p>Blogs are a great way to reach a large audience online, whether it is one&#8217;s content or someone else&#8217;s. Linking back to blogs on social media is a great way to increase organic traffic to a practice&#8217;s website. Being featured in a blog post can also help gain recognition among members of the local community. Reaching out to writers and asking them to include a website link in a blog can also encourage web traffic. Each time a practice is mentioned in a blog or on another web page, it can help improve its search engine ranking.</p>\r\n<h3>Social Media Posts</h3>\r\n<p>Social media is another aspect of organic marketing. When patients post about a practice or<a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/\"> share its content</a> on social media, it is an opportunity for their followers to not only read the post but repost it themselves. The number of people reading about the practice can thus grow exponentially. One can also use social media marketing to boost organic reach by sharing their website&#8217;s content on social media. With the wide variety of social media platforms available, organic marketing is significant and takes place constantly.</p>\r\n<h3>Case Studies</h3>\r\n<p>Another organic marketing activity is creating case studies. These case studies can be about different topics like interesting cases to specialty treatments. This information provides helpful information for other patients dealing with similar concerns and can attract patients who were unaware of those treatments. Having a case study published can be a great way to promote services and gain credibility.</p>\r\n<h3>Email Blasts</h3>\r\n<p>Emails sent to existing or prospective patients are also organic marketing. These emails can be about a new service offering or a more advanced treatment method. Updating previous patients with these emails can be an effective way to help them remember one&#8217;s practice and possibly spread the information organically to the people around them.</p>\r\n<h2>Feel Confident About Your Marketing Strategy</h2>\r\n<p>Organic marketing is one possible element of an effective marketing strategy.

However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/what-is-barnacle-seo/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Using the right keywords is important for your business. However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to rank on their own with so much competition. Barnacle SEO is an effective technique in these situations to help such businesses rank for competitive keywords. Here is why this technique is effective and why our team at Doctor Genius prefers to use it.</p>\r\n<h2>An Overview of Barnacle SEO</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008, Search Influence&#8217;s Will Scott coined the term &#8220;barnacle SEO&#8221; to describe the process of smaller businesses attaching their names to larger, more established domains to benefit from their authority. Using established websites that rank for the most popular and competitive keywords can help a small or new business rank higher without doing the same work necessary for traditional SEO.</p>\r\n<p>Barnacle SEO mimics the relationship that takes place in the natural world between barnacles and whales. Barnacles, tiny arthropods no bigger than an inch in diameter, attach themselves to a moving object, like a whale, to gather nutrients from the current. Similar to this relationship, a business can benefit from attaching its name to a search engine whale. The business can go wherever the search engine whale goes, even to the top of the SERPs. The barnacle and whale relationship is a commensal one. The barnacle does not hurt the whale, nor does it help it. However, in order to make the most of the barnacle SEO technique, it is important to act more like a partner to the big websites and less like a parasite.</p>\r\n<h3>Guest Blogging</h3>\r\n<p>Guest blogging is one of the most popular barnacle SEO activities. This particular strategy involves reaching out to websites and pitching a guest blog post. Doing this can seem intimidating for small and new businesses. However, blogs with authority may be willing to work with smaller ones, especially if helping out means adding another article to be ranked on their website. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before reaching out to a website, it is beneficial to research topics that are trending in a particular niche. It is also helpful to consider topics that have not had much coverage but may benefit readers. Identify top blogs and craft an attractive pitch for a guest blog post. If the website is big enough, a guest blog can receive many visitors and shares.</p>\r\n<h3>Types of Websites to Target</h3>\r\n<p>Using barnacle SEO does not always involve asking for a guest blog appearance. Another activity involves targeting websites that people use daily. These websites are online directories and publishing platforms. Some commonly used websites for barnacle SEO are Google My Business, Angie&#8217;s List, Facebook, and TripAdvisor. It is also beneficial to identify websites that specifically cater to one&#8217;s niche. Once the target sites are identified, one can create a profile to list their business and begin using barnacle SEO.</p>\r\n<h3>Leverage Review Sites</h3>\r\n<p>There are several benefits to leveraging review sites. One significant advantage is that it can help with SEO. Review sites like TripAdvisor, Google My Business, Yelp, Angie&#8217;s List, and Foursquare have a lot of search engine authority. Make sure to keep all information up-to-date on each review site. It is also essential to complete a profile and include all the information that potential customers will need, like the business location, hours, and services. </p>\r\n<p>A strong profile with positive customer reviews can help to rank higher for local searches. In addition to boosting online reputation, it is also a great way to get more direct and organic traffic. When creating a profile, it is also necessary to consider the types of terms that typically rank well for review sites. Some examples are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">(Product or service) review</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">(Product or service) alternatives</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Tools like (product or service)</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Writing for Publishing Platforms</h3>\r\n<p>Listing a business on online directories is a popular barnacle SEO strategy, but other options can also yield good results. Writing for any of the many publishing platforms can help expand reach. One of the most popular and effective publishing platforms is Medium. Medium consistently ranks on the first page for competitive key terms in various industries, from business to health. Another benefit of Medium is that its results often include featured snippets.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post\">Publishing on Medium</a> is fairly straightforward. It is acceptable to target an industry&#8217;s most competitive key terms when using barnacle SEO. Here is an overview of the process:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Conduct keyword research</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Select the search intent</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Optimize content so it aligns with the target keyword</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use subheadings and incorporate keywords where possible</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Embed or add creatives, such as images, infographics, and video</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Above all, make sure the writing is of high quality.

Reaching your audience,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-connect-to-an-audience-through-social-media/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>It can be difficult to effectively manage your practice&#8217;s social media accounts while taking care of patients. Reaching your audience, building relationships, and creating a good first impression online requires more than just posting an advertisement. Interactive marketing relies on communication and relevancy to make an impact. Here are some tips to boost your online presence and connect with your audience through social media organically.</p>\r\n<h2>Variety and Frequency of Social Media Communication</h2>\r\n<p>Regardless of the social media platforms used, there is a sweet spot for how many times to post. However, there is no hard and fast rule for how often a business should post. It is also essential to create engaging and informative content to get the audience interested in learning more.</p>\r\n<h3>Tailor Each Platform</h3>\r\n<p>It may be appropriate to post on some platforms daily, while others may only require posting a few days a week. Sticking to approximately one post per day is ideal for most social media platforms. This practice is especially true for Facebook and Instagram, where posting one to two times a day is acceptable for most businesses. Posting less than this may cause prospective patients to lose interest, while posting more can overwhelm or even annoy leads. Consistency is key for both platforms.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding Twitter, there is much more flexibility in how frequently to post, as there is often a shorter window for businesses to reach clients just after tweeting. Some businesses can post as many as five times a day with good results. Posting once a day during the workweek on LinkedIn is ideal as business professionals, and older adults primarily use it.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Forms of Engagement</h3>\r\n<p>While there is a limit on how often to post on social media accounts, there is no limit to online engagement with prospective and current clients. If someone interacts with a platform through a comment or question, the business should <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\">try to respond immediately</a>. The sooner the response, the better the chances are of meeting their needs and establishing a relationship.</p>\r\n<p>It can be challenging to keep track of social media communication, so turning on notifications for accounts or assigning an individual to manage the social media page can help one remain consistent. If responding right away is not possible, try to answer at least by the end of the day. Social media interaction with clients is now more important than ever. <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service\">Research</a> has found that 33% of customers prefer to contact companies through social media rather than the phone and that 77% of U.S. online adults say that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide good service.</p>\r\n<h3>Developing a Strategy</h3>\r\n<p>The first step to delivering great content is to design a social media strategy. This plan should identify marketing goals and the target audience. There are many different approaches to social media marketing that a business may take. Still, there are common goals like building brand awareness, growing page likes, generating leads, and increasing website visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Developing Goals</h3>\r\n<p>The first marketing campaign for recently established businesses or ones new to social media should build the target audience&#8217;s awareness. Businesses will often use paid advertisements geared toward a specific demographic to do this. Having a solid understanding of the brand identity and niche can help make this process quicker and more successful. Growing page likes is important as audience engagement is essential to making the most of investments in social media marketing. Encouraging page likes is one way to grow an audience. One way to do this is through doing page-like campaigns to get people to follow a practice on social media.</p>\r\n<p>The primary business goal is to generate sales. In the medical field, this means finding potential patients seeking services and getting them to contact one&#8217;s office. Lead generation is more successful after a business gains a decent level of brand awareness. People are more likely to hear about a practice through social media than to land organically on a page through a search engine. One way to do this is by starting a social media campaign geared towards link clicks. This campaign can increase a website&#8217;s SEO and get more people to visit the website and learn more about the services available.</p>\r\n<h3>Diversifying Types of Content</h3>\r\n<p>Once a social media strategy is in place, the next step is to create content. Creating content that informs and interests people can draw in potential patients. Posts should vary depending on the platforms used instead of relying on the same type of content. Diversifying content through various images, videos, polls, contests, and more can lead to more audience engagement and interest.</p>\r\n<p>Add hashtags to posts and engage the audience by asking questions, sharing pictures of patients (with permission) on social media, and showing engagement in the local community. One can also use the story features on social media to get followers interested in what they do. While a social media marketing strategy can also include advertisements, including content that feels organic helps visitors relate and feel more connected while interacting online.</p>\r\n<h2>Reach More Patients</h2>\r\n<p>Growing your social media presence and connecting with your audience through interactive marketing can help you reach more people.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay.

It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
