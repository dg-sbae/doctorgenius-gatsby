While neural matching has not replaced the previous algorithms used to generate Google search results, it does play a role in how the latest Google core update ranks webpages.</p>\r\n<h2>Neural matching</h2>\r\n<p>Google has always been somewhat secretive about how its search algorithms work. Additionally, the company does not use every algorithm it has developed and does not usually disclose which algorithms are in use at any one time. The reasoning is that if Google revealed exactly how the algorithms work, it would be easy for users to exploit them to artificially boost their pages to the top of the search results. </p>\r\n<h3>What neural matching is</h3>\r\n<p>Neural matching is part of the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">most recent update</a> to Google&#8217;s search algorithm. It utilizes artificial intelligence to make search results more diverse. The use of AI technology makes it easier for the Google search engine to analyze language and interpret the intent of search queries. This allows Google to match a webpage to a query based solely on the text of the webpage. </p>\r\n<p>One way the neural matching algorithm is expected to improve the search engine&#8217;s ability to interpret queries is by making it better at recognizing when people search for a term that means the same thing as a keyword on a webpage. It is estimated that this algorithm will affect about 30% of user queries.</p>\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/\">research paper released by Google</a>, the algorithm may use document relevance ranking to determine the best search results while avoiding spam and irrelevant results. In other words, this algorithm could help the search engine figure out which results are the best and rank those the highest while pushing pages that try to game the system or have little relevance to the query lower in the rankings. </p>\r\n<h3>How neural matching affects search engine optimization</h3>\r\n<p>The core concept of neural matching is to reward content creators for effectively answering the questions posed by users in queries and de-emphasize the role of links and keywords. However, this does not mean that Google has completely abandoned the traditional ranking criteria used by the core algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>Rather, it is believed that the traditional criteria are applied first to thin the herd by removing spam and irrelevant pages from the results. Then, the new algorithm is used to re-rank the remaining results, so that the most useful results receive the top rankings. Doctor Genius can help content creators improve page rankings by creating content that is useful to users while also establishing the basic credibility and relevance of the content by attracting high-quality backlinks and including relevant keywords.</p>\r\n<h2>Optimize your SEO</h2>\r\n<p>The implementation of neural matching has not radically changed how Google rankings work. However, it could impact how your pages rank. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact Doctor Genius today</a> to find out how we can help you optimize your pages to make the most of this new neural matching algorithm. </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Utilizing keywords does nothing<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When optimizing your practice&#8217;s webpage to boost its ranking in searches, keywords are only the beginning. Utilizing keywords does nothing if readers do not read your posts. You want high conversion numbers, and shorter attention spans may put even the most SEO-optimized site at risk. Learn how to create articles that readers can quickly skim to glean the highlights.</p>\r\n<h2>How ranking and content work together</h2>\r\n<p>Google uses algorithms to increase a page&#8217;s visibility during a search return. The higher your site ranks, the more likely a potential client is to click on your page. However, getting clicks is just the beginning. Your content format must also engage and appeal to your practice&#8217;s target audience. Your blog posts should be easy to read, focusing on <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/\">topics and information relevant</a> to your practice. When we at DG create content, we focus on making them topical and easy to read.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing blogs for your target audience</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/\">Time magazine</a>, the average person gives an article approximately 15 seconds before abandoning it. You have to hook potential clients in that short time. Utilizing methods designed to provide them with information in easy-to-digest chunks can help. Employing several methods in posts to increase reader engagement may translate into more appointments for your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Headings</h3>\r\n<p>A good strategy to help appeal to a skimmer is utilizing headings. As in this article, paragraph headers break up content by topics. While this alone may not be enough to convey your message to readers, it can direct the eyes to the portions of your content that appeal directly to them. For instance, if your interest lies in creating lists, you may jump to the heading entitled &#8220;Bullet Points&#8221; in this article. Headings direct readers to the information they seek.</p>\r\n<h3>Bullet points</h3>\r\n<p>As a way to further maximize skimming, integrate bullet points and lists into your posts. There are a variety of ways you can do this effectively. Try not to overuse this method as your content will wind up looking like a to-do list rather than an informative and engaging post. Some elements that lend themselves easily to bullet lists include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Symptoms and signs</li>\r\n\t<li>Frequently prescribed medications</li>\r\n\t<li>Common diagnoses</li>\r\n\t<li>Treatment options</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When readers start by reading lists, it may catch their attention and prompt them to finish the article for more insight.</p>\r\n<h3>Visual aids</h3>\r\n<p>People may gravitate to posts that contain visual content other than words. Integrating photographs, graphs, and charts into your content may capture potential clients by giving them something colorful to ponder. Visual representations of medical conditions, such as cavities, may also help readers understand what they need to watch for in themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Get help hooking clients</h2>\r\n<p>Your practice hinges on new patients, and grabbing their attention requires content that is easily digestible and informative.

Too many consumers are online and engaged in social media not to take advantage of it, but failing to know where your audience lies in the massive online community can waste any strategy, no matter how good it may seem on paper. Determining the right content format for your business is the first step in reaching the right audience. Here are some popular and useful options to consider.</p>\r\n<h3>Blog posts</h3>\r\n<p>When brainstorming ideas for your next marketing promotion, blog posts have more than likely made the list. Blogs are popular for many good reasons, as they can be incredibly successful in conveying important information to a variety of readers. There are endless types of posts that can be used to your advantage, like guides, lists, reviews, and how-to articles. However, a blog post has its limitations, and other forms of content may connect better with your audience.</p>\r\n<h3>Videos</h3>\r\n<p>There is no question why video platforms, such as YouTube, have remained successful for so many years. People of all ages watch videos for both entertainment and learning purposes. Videos are one of the easiest ways for viewers to absorb new content, which makes them an excellent resource for businesses looking to expand marketing. From ads to tutorials, you can use a video to address your audience about almost anything.</p>\r\n<h3>Research</h3>\r\n<p>Research that a business does itself and reports is more likely to get shared and viewed than research you report from someone else. Getting shares can skyrocket search engine optimization via backlinks and by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\">establishing greater credibility</a>. Conducting a survey can not only help your own business grow but may be of great interest to others in your niche.</p>\r\n<h3>Infographics</h3>\r\n<p>Infographics combine pictures and words to generate engaging content that gets to the point quickly. They are easy to follow, visually appealing, and loaded with helpful information that a reader can easily digest. The amount of time viewers spend looking at a single piece of content continues to decrease, so crafting content that gets the main points across without hassle is ideal in today’s fast-paced media.</p>\r\n<h2>Explore more content forms for marketing</h2>\r\n<p>These are only a handful of possible content formats to consider for your business. Discussing your specific clientele needs directly with a professional can help narrow down a successful marketing strategy. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for more information on content formats and to get help planning your next promotional campaign.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

When someone browses the web for a relevant practitioner, you not only want your company&#8217;s webpage to rank high on search results, but you also want that click to convert into an appointment. How do you build trust using your website? Discover a few ways regular blog posts may accomplish this, and more, for your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Blog posts build a connection</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb\">Forbes.com</a>, blog posts help establish a connection between readers and your practice. When your content is well written and provides accurate information in a relatable way, readers will respond. Creating informative posts bridges the gap between potential customers and your practice. Adding posts regularly builds your presence in the Google metrics and boosts your live site.</p>\r\n<h2>Successful blogs contain these elements</h2>\r\n<p>At DG, we know what it takes to boost your blog. By utilizing SEO-friendly techniques, our content develops an authoritative voice to elevate your practice in search results. Google uses the E-A-T system (Expertise, Authority, and Trust) to rank the trustworthiness of a brand or website. The more blogs that utilize certain measures, the higher the hits in this search metric. Delve into how these elements may yield new patients for your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<p>Every blog post should contain factual information. Citing outside sources via backlinks is one way to ensure the reader knows the claims made are accurate. Having verifiable sources that support the content in your blog is crucial to building the trust required to elevate your blog and business. If you are successful in establishing your authority, you may find other websites that link to your posts. When another webpage does this, it increases the visibility of your own through backlinking.</p>\r\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>SEO writing revolves around using keywords that search engines pick up when users enter them in the search box. Using keywords effectively in blog posts increases the likelihood of a company&#8217;s page showing up in results. Knowing the appropriate keywords to utilize when optimizing hits is an integral part of digital marketing.</p>\r\n<h3>Internal linking</h3>\r\n<p>When creating new material, you have the opportunity to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\">promote older posts</a>. Blogs remain intact on the practice&#8217;s page until deleted. If there is a shortage of ideas for new material, refresh older posts. Since the medical community is continually changing, you may update a previous post with new science. Instead of deleting the previous post, link it to the new. This is another effective way to increase views and trust for your business.</p>\r\n<h2>The time to capture business is now</h2>\r\n<p>Getting new patients should no longer depend only on referrals. Take control of your marketing through the creation of regular blog posts. Our team at Doctor Genius is standing by to answer your questions and get you started.

The thrill that comes with the prospect<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-have-a-live-site/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>For many business owners, building a website is an exciting yet stressful endeavor. The thrill that comes with the prospect of expanding one’s reach and attracting new patients or clients is shadowed by the pressure to get everything, from the design to the navigation to the content, just right. If you can relate to this, you may be tempted to sit back, relax, and watch your site do its work once you hit “Publish.” We recommend against doing this, as your website will not work for you — at least not very well — without some tender loving care.</p>\r\n<h2>How to increase the effectiveness of your website</h2>\r\n<p>To maximize the effectiveness of your website, you need to keep it active. A live site is one that is continually updated, maintained, and refined. To keep your website from decaying, create a live site checklist. Below are four items to add to it.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Refresh your content</h3>\r\n<p>Content drives traffic to your website and engages visitors. However, if it is not written for your audience, contains errors, or lacks the appropriate keywords, you risk driving visitors away: if you attract them at all.</p>\r\n<p>After you launch your site, wait a couple of days and then go back to review your content with a fresh eye. Overtime, tweak it so that it is in line with your brand’s voice and speaks directly to your target market. Optimize it for search, correct any errors, and take out or edit any information that is inaccurate or no longer relevant. Go through <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\">old blogs</a> that were successful, looking for what worked and what didn&#8217;t work on ranking reports. At this point, you can decide if your keywords need to be refreshed, so that future blogs are relevant or if you should elaborate on what worked well. For webpages, after enough time has elapsed, you may need to redo the page altogether. By auditing your content regularly, you can ensure it stays fresh and effective.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Add new content</h3>\r\n<p>Google prioritizes new, pertinent content over the stale, out-of-date subject matter. This is evident by its <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/freshness-update/#close\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/freshness-update/#close\">2016 “Freshness” algorithm</a>, which places a greater emphasis on the recentness of content than it ever has before. Not only does Google appreciate new content, but so, too, does your audience.</p>\r\n<p>New content in the form of blogs, landing pages, videos, infographics, white papers, and the like helps you to increase audience retention, establish trust, build authority, and, ultimately, encourage conversions. For these reasons, and for ranking purposes, one of the first things you should do after launching your website is to build a content marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Update your imagery</h3>\r\n<p>When people return to your site, it is because they like what they saw before and want to see what new and exciting things you have to offer. Changes, no matter how slight (such as a new banner or an updated team picture), can appease return visitors and entice them to visit again soon.</p>\r\n<p>New imagery can also give your rankings a boost. By using alt text, captions, image sitemaps, and image structured data, you can make your imagery searchable, ensuring that each page of content pulls double duty.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Check usability</h3>\r\n<p>Several factors affect usability, including site speed, navigation, security and mobility. Perform a complete audit of your site across multiple different devices and platforms to ensure it performs optimally on each. If you discover any shortcomings or errors, such as 404s or slow load time, fix them to ensure a smooth user experience.   </p>\r\n<h2>See how our marketing solutions can keep your site live</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we have the tools, talent, and resources to help your business thrive online.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay.

It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
