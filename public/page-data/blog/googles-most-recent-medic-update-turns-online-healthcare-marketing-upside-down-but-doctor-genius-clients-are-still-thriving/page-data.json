This event is a weekend full of the latest advancements in dentistry with courses on effective dental practice techniques, over 550 exhibitors from all areas of the dental market and a plethora of speakers &#8211; among which, Doctor Genius will be present.</p>\r\n<h3>Offering the Marketing Solutions Every Dental Practice Needs</h3>\r\n<p>Dental practices can greatly benefit from having a strong online presence and an active website. Doctor Genius not only offers professionals a chance for a stronger online presence, but we also keep the website active by using key marketing techniques to help professionals extend their reach online. Doctor Genius will be at booth #244 at the CDA event to go over the marketing solutions and available technologies. Here is a list summarizing our services.</p>\r\n<h3>Website</h3>\r\n<p>We create custom content and personalize websites for each client. At Doctor Genius, the client can feel safe knowing that the website contains all of his or her services in one place.</p>\r\n<h3>Branding</h3>\r\n<p>We also deliver effective brand strategies to help give practices a major edge in competitive markets. We will use the proper branding to highlight the client’s services and areas of expertise.</p>\r\n<h3>Search Marketing</h3>\r\n<p>We can narrow down the list of keywords to the words that most frequently appear in people’s searches online. With a list of keywords for each client, we can work to yield higher numbers of new patient inquiries into one’s practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Review Management</h3>\r\n<p>We can highlight positive and easily-readable reviews of a client’s practice on the website. After reading the reviews, patients will be more likely to consider a practice for dental care.</p>\r\n<h3>Hyper-Local Targeting</h3>\r\n<p>We will increase the focus of a client’s website to the local area and enhance the client’s reach to possible patients there. By targeting the local area, we can help the client rank higher online in the local area.</p>\r\n<h3>Social Media</h3>\r\n<p>We will not only help monitor and create regular posts for the client’s social media pages, but we will also ensure that the social media pages remain active and engage followers.</p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Voice Search Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p>We will properly optimize your website for voice search as Google is shifting from a search engine to an “answer engine.” Voice search drastically improves user experience – and because of that, by the year 2020, 50% of all online searches will be made through voice search.</p>\r\n<p>With HIPPA compliant voice technology features, devices such as Amazon Alexa have developed their technology to allow patients, caregivers and healthcare members to provide better patient experiences. You might be asking, “why?” The answer is that these voice features help patients perform healthcare-related tasks, access their health data and interact with their providers. Voice search optimization can certainly impact practice revenue, improving brand awareness, and attracting more new patients online.</p>\r\n<p>The main reason your Healthcare SEO strategy should continuously refine and evolve is because of how different text and voice searches actually are. Since users of voice search are essentially having a conversation with their personal assistant device, your content should fit this context. Answering questions promptly and accurately is key for ranking but most importantly, will further enhance your online digital marketing efforts.</p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Start with a Strong Foot Forward</span></h3>\r\n<p>We help clients build trustworthy relationships with their patients by providing strong online content. We also provide ranking reports and help maximize the client’s website for better results. Working with Doctor Genius, clients can start their practice by putting a strong foot forward with a professional, mobile-first website.
