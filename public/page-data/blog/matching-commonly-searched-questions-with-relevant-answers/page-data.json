When creating a strategy for content marketing, you should always have both user experience and search engine visibility in mind. If used correctly, implementing <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/faq-page#:~:text=FAQ%20pages%20include%20a%20series,for%20both%20customers%20and%20employees.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/faq-page#:~:text=FAQ%20pages%20include%20a%20series,for%20both%20customers%20and%20employees.\">FAQ pages</a> and sections allows you to accomplish both goals simultaneously.</p>\r\n<h2>The benefits of including commonly asked questions</h2>\r\n<p>Adding a frequently asked questions section to your webpages and blog posts can be time-consuming, but the payoff is worth the added effort.</p>\r\n<h3>Search engine optimization</h3>\r\n<p>The primary goal of SEO is to make your practice more visible on search engines by tailoring your content to rank better on the results page. When you consider that many people enter questions into the search box when researching a topic, it makes sense that researching and including a frequently asked questions in your content can help people land on your page.</p>\r\n<h3>Patient loyalty</h3>\r\n<p>If a patient has a question that your content successfully answers, this reflects positively on your practice and helps establish a positive relationship with the visitor. Potential patients want to know that your medical staff is qualified to provide the needed services, so displaying your expertise in your field builds trust. Even if visitors initially land on your page looking for specific information, there is a higher potential for them to become interested in your office and the services you offer.</p>\r\n<h3>User experience</h3>\r\n<p>An easy-to-use, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/websites\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/websites\">professional website</a> impresses visitors and guides them toward making a purchase or learning more about your service, while a nonresponsive site that is difficult to navigate can have the opposite effect, causing potential clients to look for a different practice. A frequently asked question section or page offers a user-friendly layout that allows patients to quickly scan the information and focus only on what is relevant to the search.</p>\r\n<h2>Tips for optimizing your commonly asked questions section</h2>\r\n<p>To get better results from a question and answer section, you must first develop a strategy and research what topics to cover.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most basic ways to find commonly asked questions is to do a Google search to find these. If you already have a list of keywords you want to include in your content, start by searching these terms.</p>\r\n<p>Many times, Google has a “<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/06/23/how-brands-can-optimize-googles-people-also-ask-feature/#31abdaeb1159\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/06/23/how-brands-can-optimize-googles-people-also-ask-feature/#31abdaeb1159\">People Also Ask</a>” section that includes questions people often search about the topic, along with an answer found on a specific webpage. For instance, if you search for “tooth decay” you may see questions like “How is tooth decay treated?” and “What are the stages of tooth decay?”</p>\r\n<p>To potentially be featured under this section and to rank higher on the Google results page when a patient searches these specific questions, include them in your FAQ section with keyword-rich answers.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you improve your content marketing strategy</h2>\r\n<p>Creating your content strategy, including adding questions and answer sections where relevant, can be difficult.

According to a survey of mobile usage conducted <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017.\">statista.com</a> between 2015 and 2020, more than half of online traffic worldwide occurred on a mobile device. Chances are, customers are visiting your site on their phones more than any other device. It is crucial to design site architecture that can translate from a desktop user to a mobile user without issue. Here are strategies to develop a site that optimizes mobile use while still remaining accessible to all other devices.</p>\r\n<h2>Going from desktop to mobile</h2>\r\n<p>A user should be able to flip from a desktop browser to a mobile browser and still recognize your pages as the same site, just in a slightly different format. A site that fails to load properly on anything other than a desktop is more likely to lose potential customers visiting for the first time. Before you create an entirely separate page specifically for mobile use, check to see if your site already has a responsive design that can convert the layout from one device to another.</p>\r\n<h3>Website responsiveness</h3>\r\n<p>Responsiveness refers to a site’s ability to appear cohesive, uniform, and similar on any device, regardless of each device’s screen size. The site’s pages and links should remain the same, with small changes that adapt it for easy mobile use. With newer website templates, this may already be the case. If not, there are plenty of tools available online to help design a website with proper responsiveness.</p>\r\n<h2>Strategies to make a mobile site easier to use</h2>\r\n<p>Before designing your mobile site, answer several key questions about your audience:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>What information is your audience looking for most often?</li>\r\n\t<li>What questions and answers do visitors frequently search for on your website?</li>\r\n\t<li>What pages are most popular on your site?</li>\r\n\t<li>What do you want customers to know about your business?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When people use mobile devices — frequently phones — they are usually looking for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">quick answers to short questions</a>. Identifying those questions can help you establish SEO and ideal content for mobile users specifically. You can use Google Analytics to track the traffic that comes to your site to determine what answers people get on your site. From there, consider the following points to implement to make this content more accessible on a mobile platform:</p>\r\n<h3>Consistent screen width</h3>\r\n<p>There is nothing more irritating than having to scroll horizontally to see an entire webpage on your phone. Make sure that the full width of your site is visible on each screen size. This may mean changing how content appears on the screen.</p>\r\n<h3>Expandable images</h3>\r\n<p>Since phones offer a limited viewing space, many users prefer images that can expand. This makes it easier to see products and pictures that appear smaller than usual on the screen.</p>\r\n<h3>Single tabs only</h3>\r\n<p>Moving between separate browser tabs on a small device can be challenging. Ensuring that links to other pages remain in the same tab can minimize user frustration and route customers back to your site.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more ways to make mobile sites</h2>\r\n<p>Understanding how to reach the right audience on a mobile platform is a large part of business success.

Creating a shiny new website for your company is only half the battle — the rest involves filling in content that is engaging, useful, and informative to your customers. Keywords within that content are crucial for designing search engine optimization to bring to your site customers who might not know about your business and what you do. To take advantage of the latest search trends, you need to know why certain keywords and subjects are important for your business and how to use them effectively in content.</p>\r\n<h2>The importance of search trends</h2>\r\n<p>Search trends can be broken down into several categories. One involves seasonal change, e.g., consumers may be more interested in buying products during the summer than in the winter. Another is all about keywords, which are specific words or short phrases you use in the content of your website that a search engine matches to the search words someone has typed in. The more you incorporate those keywords, the higher your content will rank in engines like Google. Learning how to use these trends to guide your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\">latest article or blog topics</a> can keep your content relevant and appealing.</p>\r\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>To narrow down keywords that fit within the context of your work, you first have to figure out what consumers are searching for and what they are not. You can use the latest trends and analytics to narrow down keywords that match what your clients type into Google. Consider using a mix of short-tail and long-tail keywords to diversify your SEO and attract a wide variety of clients.</p>\r\n<h3>Short-tail keywords</h3>\r\n<p>As the name suggests, short-tail keywords are made up of three or fewer words. These are often incredibly broad and more frequently searched for. There are benefits and drawbacks to using shorter keywords. Your content is more likely to rank with a shorter keyword because so many articles can fit in the general topic. This allows for more people, particularly new customers, to find your page. However, your webpage will be competing with numerous other pages with the same keyword, sometimes in the thousands, making it less likely to rank higher in the results list.</p>\r\n<h3>Long-tail keywords</h3>\r\n<p>When you want to attract customers looking for something more specific, long-tail keywords are ideal. Longer keywords and phrases narrow down the search significantly, and while a keyword over three words long may not be searched for as frequently as shorter ones, someone who types it in is probably looking for exactly what you have to offer. It also makes your site <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274809\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274809\">more likely to rank higher</a> in the list of search engine results.</p>\r\n<h2>Tools to discover search trends</h2>\r\n<p>You can use any of these tools for search analytics to discover search trends and keywords:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Google Analytics</li>\r\n\t<li>Matomo</li>\r\n\t<li>Woopra</li>\r\n\t<li>GoSquared</li>\r\n\t<li>FoxMetrics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you have established a list of keywords and trends, you can confidently start using them in your content marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<h2>Find out more about searched subjects</h2>\r\n<p>Give your website the greatest chance to succeed by researching keywords and trends. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for help identifying the searched subjects for your business.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
