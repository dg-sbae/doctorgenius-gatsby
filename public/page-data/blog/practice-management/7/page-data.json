Fortunately, there is still hope for businesses and private practices. At Doctor Genius, we can help dentists, and other practices maximize their online presence and reach in the digital market. These steps, when done correctly, can help you chart your way toward building a strong, healthy, and resilient practice following the quarantine.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a resilient business after a pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies are creating contingency plans as precautions against COVID-19. Some are implementing or adapting existing plans, while others have to develop new plans. The following are measures that companies can take to build a stronger and healthier business.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider the effect of coronavirus on customers</h3>\r\n<p>Depending on the industry, customers might be experiencing certain difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Business owners need to think strategically about the challenges that customers are facing and what can be done to help them. Using those facts, they can create a new sales pitch and structure their marketing plans to meet those challenges and needs.</p>\r\n<p>Regular business challenges typically worsen during a crisis. Business owners have the role of restructuring their product offerings to address the specific struggles faced by their customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Adopt new sales mediums</h3>\r\n<p>Despite the total lockdown, people will need to make purchases, providing opportunities to offer your products or services through alternative sales channels. For instance, if COVID-19 is halting customer visits to the company’s store, it is time to target and expand eCommerce channels. Business owners need to review their internet marketing efforts and e-commerce sales and see how they provide a boost.</p>\r\n<p>Focus more on conversations on social media and LinkedIn over physical sales meetings. Many B2B companies, especially those who deal with software or digital services and solutions, are already in this realm. The business continues, and more of it might need to go online.</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on long-term investments</h3>\r\n<p>The coronavirus disease situation might be the cue to make long-term investments in the business, especially those in B2B sales. If there is a momentary relapse in sales, then the time is right to reevaluate operations, processes, and existing platforms and get strategic for the long term. If there are major prospects in view, now is the time to dedicate more resources and effort into managing the leads and capitalizing on longer-term opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Monitor the leads, provide reassurances, and let everyone know that there are contingency plans in place and that they can access help when needed. This unparalleled situation is undoubtedly causing many cancellations like concert tickets, airline reservations, and business conferences. Still, high-ticket B2B sales may not suffer as much, unless the crisis continues for longer than anticipated, and companies start to reduce spending and investment.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us to Learn More Today</h2>\r\n<p>Economic recovery might happen earlier than expected. If you fail to position your business strategically, however, you may not be well-placed to build on post-pandemic recovery. Companies can take salient measures now to ensure that they come out of a major crisis like COVID-19 stronger and healthier.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

For many parents who now have to work remotely, they may face additional challenges concentrating on work, and dealing with their kids as coronavirus disease continues to be a problem. Parents need to implement a setup that allows them to work undisturbed and keep everyone happy.</p>\r\n<h2>Maintaining a safe and happy WFH space</h2>\r\n<p>Here are five creative ways to work productively at home by keeping the Work-From-Home, WFH, space safe and happy:</p>\r\n<h3>Develop a schedule</h3>\r\n<p>Creating a strict schedule that is identical to a normal school day can be helpful. The kids will continue to wake up, eat, and get dressed as usual. Then they can stay busy with assignments. When they are engaged, parents can focus on getting their work done. During productive hours, the kids should be distracted with playtime.</p>\r\n<h3>Use technology</h3>\r\n<p>Provide toys for the kids to play with and set time for them to use technology, away from the work area. Kids love movies or computer time, so maximize that. Educational websites are available to improve a child&#8217;s creativity. When on a strict deadline, a new movie could work like a charm.</p>\r\n<h3>Use door signs</h3>\r\n<p>There should always be a private space, though; it could be the bedroom, closet, basement, guest room, or an area where one can have undisturbed quiet space. Separating the space makes drawing the line much easier. In the WFH space, there can be a sign on the door, so when they see the &#8220;stop&#8221; sign, they know not to come in unless there is something important going on. If the sign shows &#8220;enter,&#8221; then they can come in.</p>\r\n<h3>Set boundaries for the children</h3>\r\n<p>It is necessary to set boundaries for kids when working from home, especially if they are of school age. Parents can allow their kids to watch more TV and play games than usual to stay occupied. The kids need to understand that it is temporary, however. While they are at it, parents can tell them when they do not want to be disturbed. Even if there is no designated office space in the house, establishing clear boundaries with the kids can help.</p>\r\n<h3>Old-school activities</h3>\r\n<p>Before gadgets came around, puzzles and scrapbooking were the cool stuff. They can still work to keep children busy and keep the WFH space safe and happy while the COVID-19 lockdown lasts. These activities can be interesting, and more importantly, they tend to be time-consuming. So, encourage the kids to channel their inner craftmanship during workhours.</p>\r\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\r\n<p>It is normal for children to desire attention. If both parents are working from home, creating shifts can make remote work much easier. If a parent works early in the morning, their partner can wake up the kids and handle tasks around the house. Switching shifts will allow parents to work uninterruptedly throughout the day. If switching shifts between partners are not feasible, especially for those whose partners cannot work remotely during the COVID-19 crisis, creating a strict schedule and planning could help optimize the day.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

The jobs of medical professionals are far more challenging because they often treat patients who may have contagious conditions such as COVID-19. For many, this causes increased anxiety and distress, which can affect short-term and long-term well-being.</p>\r\n<p>It is crucial for medical teams to have support resources available to them, so they can deal with any negative mental, physical, or emotional concerns they have. Many medical workers begin to feel more anxious, experience extreme fatigue, and become more fearful as they treat patients who may have COVID-19. Support resources help them deal with these concerns and be at their healthiest mental and physical state so they can do their jobs to the best of their ability. </p>\r\n<h3>Resources for mental, physical and emotional support</h3>\r\n<p>There are many support resources available to medical teams. In addition to seeking assistance from others within the practice, workers can find support from the following resources:</p>\r\n<p>American Psychiatric Association (APA): <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/well-being-and-burnout/well-being-resources\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/well-being-and-burnout/well-being-resources\">The APA</a> offers well-being resources for healthcare workers who may experience burnout, anxiety, depression, and more.</p>\r\n<p>American Medical Association (AMA): <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/managing-mental-health-during-covid-19\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/managing-mental-health-during-covid-19\">The AMA</a> has special resources designed for medical workers to take care of themselves, as well as insights into how practices can provide assistance for their staff.</p>\r\n<p>World Health Organization (WHO): Resources such as <a href=\"https://www.who.int/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.who.int/\">WHO</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a> are a great place to learn more about COVID-19. </p>\r\n<p>Health Care Toolbox: <a href=\"https://www.healthcaretoolbox.org/pediatric-traumatic-stress/14-health-care-toolbox/tools-and-resources.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthcaretoolbox.org/pediatric-traumatic-stress/14-health-care-toolbox/tools-and-resources.html\">The Health Care Toolbox </a>offers resources for medical professionals who deal with COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Headspace: <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> is a unique app that allows medical workers to de-stress after a long day and get a better night&#8217;s sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Every medical worker should look out for their health and well-being as we fight COVID-19.

Putting coping strategies into place, such as eating healthy, staying active, and interacting with loved ones, can help workers deal with the challenge COVID-19 poses. It is essential to communicate with others within your medical team, especially those in a position of leadership if you are feeling mentally or physically overwhelmed. </p>\r\n<h2>Talk to Doctor Genius for more information</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius offers free COVID-19 resources to practices and medical teams who have the task of treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dentists have a high risk of being infected due to their proximity to their patients while performing treatments.</p>\r\n<h2>How COVID-19 is changing the dental market</h2>\r\n<p>The outbreak of the coronavirus has left many business owners wondering how they will take care of their expenses. Dental clinics fall under this umbrella because many are small businesses run by a single owner.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/infectious-diseases-2019-novel-coronavirus?utm_source=adaorg&amp;utm_medium=VanityURL\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/infectious-diseases-2019-novel-coronavirus?utm_source=adaorg&amp;utm_medium=VanityURL\">American Dental Association</a> has recommended that dentists only offer emergency services to their patients as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow. Many dentists are following the recommendations of the ADA and cutting back on their hours of operation. Some clinics are even shutting down completely in the midst of all of the uncertainty. Dental clinics are also highly impacted by the scarcity of essential items like face masks, which help protect dentists and their patients.</p>\r\n<p>Dentists will have to look for creative ways to help their patients and keep their businesses running while trying to practice social distancing. Some dentists are now using their websites and phone lines to help their patients. Patients are screened over the phone to understand the nature of their problem, and the dentist can give them advice on how to proceed. Patients with issues that require emergency dental treatment are asked to come to the clinic. Screening patients helps limit the number of people at the clinic at any given time, which makes it a safer environment for everyone.</p>\r\n<h2>The Importance of providing emergency dental treatments</h2>\r\n<p>Dentists have a responsibility to treat patients with dental emergencies because failing to do so would leave emergency rooms — many of which are already at their max capacities due to the pandemic — with an additional burden to take care of. The White House agrees with the ADA&#8217;s recommendations in terms of advising the population to delay elective dental or medical treatments while COVID-19 remains an issue.</p>\r\n<h3>Increasing hygiene practices</h3>\r\n<p>Dentists also have a responsibility to protect themselves and their patients during this outbreak. Social distancing should be practiced in waiting rooms with patients sitting six feet apart from each other. This should be easier to manage if only patients with dental emergencies are allowed in the clinic.</p>\r\n<p>Tele-dentistry companies will likely emerge as winners during this pandemic because people with non-essential dental needs are now more likely than ever to try such services. Brick-and-mortar dentist offices should also start developing ways to perform non-essential treatments without a need for patients to come to the clinic.</p>\r\n<h2>Help is available for the dental industry</h2>\r\n<p>The U.S. government has passed a $2-trillion stimulus that aims to provide some relief to businesses that have been hit hard by the coronavirus. Programs that dental clinics qualify for include:</p>\r\n<p>Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL): These loans are being provided on a first-come, first-serve basis. It provides an emergency grant of up to $10,000 that must be used to pay overhead expenses, employee wages, or rent/mortgage.</p>\r\n<p>Paycheck Protection program: This can give small businesses up to 2.5 times their monthly payroll to keep them afloat.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As the numbers grow and more areas go into lockdown,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/ask-the-experts-5-ways-to-scale-your-business-during-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread at an alarming rate. As the numbers grow and more areas go into lockdown, its impact on businesses is profound and unprecedented by anything we have seen in recent times. As governments take drastic measures in response to coronavirus, practices also need to adjust quickly to navigate the financial and operational difficulties that accompany the pandemic. This article contains insights from experts on how to scale your business during COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h2>Scaling your Business during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>The following are ways that practice owners can scale their establishments during the pandemic:</p>\r\n<h3>Provide flexibility</h3>\r\n<p>Stores, businesses, schools, and commercial centers around the country are shutting down operations. As the country approaches total lockdown, business owners need to give their employees more flexibility with time.</p>\r\n<p>There are many tools available to business owners to ensure efficient communication with their employers. This will allow everyone to stay in touch and keep working even if they are not in the office. There should be a policy in place regarding work policy, like when team members need to be online and available, a medium of communication (like Slack, Google Hangouts, or WhatsApp) and the deliverables for each team member.</p>\r\n<h3>Enable direct communications with customers</h3>\r\n<p>This crisis affects everyone, so it is better to be completely open about what the business is experiencing. Customers will understand the challenges that the brand is facing if they receive regular updates. When customers no longer have access to the details about the efforts done behind the scenes to get routine services, their appreciation for the service reduces, and they begin to value it less. Business owners need to explain the measures they are taking to curb risks and provide insights into the steps they are taking regarding community service.</p>\r\n<h3>Shift your sales tactics online</h3>\r\n<p>When physical locations are no longer an option, savvy business owners need to consider leveraging online platforms to curb heavy losses. Digital platforms enable interactions with customers and boost online sales. This could significantly increase the company’s sales. Businesses can keep your employees engaged and earning by selling on social media and websites, using email lists, and generating new leads with the internet.</p>\r\n<h3>Capitalize on the brand’s value</h3>\r\n<p>Brands add value to their customers, and the products or services that are beneficial during the crisis deserve the consideration of those who need them. If what the practice does supports or eases people’s lives during the lockdown, business owners need to capitalize on that and tell the brand’s story. As long as the practice focuses on delivering value, marketing and sales will continue.</p>\r\n<h3>Make necessary evaluations</h3>\r\n<p>To keep the practice running throughout the coronavirus pandemic, owners need to make critical evaluations of what matters more to the company’s survival. This includes evaluating the supply chain for vulnerabilities and identifying teams and workers that ensure essential operations or services keep running.</p>\r\n<h2>Importance of staying resilient</h2>\r\n<p>It is hard to tell when the COVID-19 pandemic will end. However, business owners can scale their businesses and stay on top of the situation by staying proactive and taking necessary measures. It is in times like this that the strength of the practice is put to the test, and those who adapt survice.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
