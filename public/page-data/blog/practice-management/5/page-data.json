Among those challenges is your ability to incite trust in prospective patients, demonstrate competency of care, and encourage prospects to choose you over your competitors — all before they ever set foot in your office. While an up-to-date website, strong content, and patient reviews can go a long way toward helping you overcome several marketing challenges, original photos and detailed imagery may be just what you need to overcome the unique three.</p>\r\n<h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>\r\n<p>You can invest all your resources into beautiful web design, informative content, and strategic SEO, but without supplementing your efforts with high-quality imagery, your efforts may be for naught. According to Solve, websites that feature “good images” receive <a href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\">94% more views</a> than those without photos or with low-quality images. Moreover, substandard photos may hurt your practice more than a lack of photos, as low-grade pictures send the impression that your brand is cheap, impersonal, and untrustworthy. The right photos, however, can do the opposite and help your practice overcome challenges one, two, and three.</p>\r\n<h3>Build trust</h3>\r\n<p>Original photography is one of the best ways to build trust in prospective patients. Real images give prospects a glimpse of who you are as a provider and what type of community you have created in-office. Genuine smiles on the faces of real patients and team members help prospects feel reassured that you operate a warm, welcome, and caring environment and that people are happy to be in your care.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, before and after photos of real patients let you live up to the adage of “show, don’t tell.” It is easy enough to state on your website that you specialize in full-mouth restorations, but convincing patients that this is true requires proof. An image gallery with clearly labeled before and after photos can serve as all the evidence you need, though it cannot hurt to accompany images with patient testimonials as well.</p>\r\n<h3>Demonstrate competency of care</h3>\r\n<p>Trust and competency go hand in hand. If a prospect does not trust that you can competently manage his or her care, he or she will not choose you despite your other redeeming qualities. Use imagery to provide a comprehensive and visual overview of your services, procedures, and outcomes, such as what we did with our <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\">new Doctor Genius video</a>. If you use high-tech equipment in your practice, go beyond original photos and use videos to demonstrate how it works. Do not be afraid to play with photos and video to guide prospects through the patient journey so they know what to expect. Finally, use imagery to educate patients on your services, address common health issues, and provide tips for how patients can protect their health.</p>\r\n<h3>Differentiate your brand</h3>\r\n<p>Last but not least, original photos are an effective way to set yourself apart from the competition. Whereas many brands still rely on stock imagery, whether because of time, cost, or unawareness, you can set your brand apart by offering a wholly transparent and honest look at your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Attract more patients with tailored solutions</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we focus solely on developing comprehensive digital marketing solutions for health care professionals.

A surprising amount of information about the health of the rest<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-covering-which-areas-will-need-referrals/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>A Complete Health approach <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/relaunch-program-part-1-complete-health-practice-with-gary-kadi-and-doctor-genius/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/relaunch-program-part-1-complete-health-practice-with-gary-kadi-and-doctor-genius/\">bridges the gap</a> between dentistry and medicine. A surprising amount of information about the health of the rest of the body can be revealed through the mouth. A checkup from a Complete Health dentist also involves screening for conditions such as oral cancer and periodontal disease. Although Complete Health is a dental philosophy, there are also medical practices in which general practitioners choose to perform simple procedures rather than referring patients to specialty practitioners.</p>\r\n<p>There are also SEO advantages to expanding your practice in unexpected directions. Patients looking for the additional services you offer may be more likely to find you if they are listed on your website or mentioned in blogs or social media posts. However, while your medical marketing materials should include the services you do perform, it should also identify the services for which you will have to refer patients to other doctors.</p>\r\n<h2>Why is it important to mention services you do not cover?</h2>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians describes the often nostalgic view of <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0900/p33.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0900/p33.html\">general practitioners</a> in the &#8220;old days&#8221; performing all types of medicine. Back then, referring patients to other doctors was not practical and sometimes not even possible. In today&#8217;s world, you cannot do everything related to the practice of medicine, and it is not reasonable to expect it. However, it is to your advantage, and the patients&#8217; benefit, to explain what you do not do.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Communicating honestly</h3>\r\n<p>Successful communication between provider and patient depends on honesty. However, a <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1137\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1137\">survey in the Journal of Health Affairs</a> revealed that a significant portion of the 1,891 respondents admitted to dishonesty in communication with patients, with 20% concealing medical errors and nearly half giving exaggeratedly positive prognoses. Explaining to your patients what you do not do upfront helps lay the foundation for honest communication.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Building a brand</h3>\r\n<p>Thanks to online information from health care websites and review apps, patients tend to be more informed before reaching the doctor&#8217;s office than ever before. This can work to your advantage if you want to be known as the doctor that treats such-and-such conditions in your area. For balance, your brand marketing should include what you do not do as well as what you do.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Managing patients&#8217; expectations</h3>\r\n<p>Patients choose health care providers not only on the basis of medical information but on the advice of family and friends. In many cases, referrals from existing patients represent a sizable portion of new patients. Therefore, one negative experience for a patient who was confused and frustrated about the services you do and do not provide could put a significant dent in your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>How do you communicate which areas require referrals?</h2>\r\n<p>In addition to communicating honestly with patients, you should also be clear in how your relay what services need to be referred. Be sure they are delineated from the services you do provide with an unambiguously worded, eye-catching header.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn effective and responsible medical marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Your medical marketing should adhere to the same standards of responsibility and ethics as the rest of your practice.

People are in need of quality health care that is compatible with their current insurance plan, perhaps more than ever in recent history.

While there may be several factors that influence the decision to make an appointment, patients ultimately need to know that your office accepts their current insurance plan. Your site may offer stunning visuals, excellent content, and stellar reviews. However, if you are missing this key component in the patient&#8217;s decision-making process, you could be losing numerous potential clients. Individuals searching for something new will likely be tempted to keep searching until they find the answers they need.</p>\r\n<h2>The benefits of adding insurance listings to your site</h2>\r\n<p>If you want to bring more patients to your practice, providing a complete, up-to-date list of accepted insurance plans is a good place to start. This eliminates wasted time on both ends, preventing the patient from enduring inconvenient wait times just to get the answer to a simple &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; question. At the same time, your office personnel can avoid the hassle of unnecessary phone calls and stay on task with other responsibilities. When your website provides the patient with all of the essential information up front, the need to continue the search is significantly reduced, if not eliminated altogether.</p>\r\n<h3>Counting on customer loyalty</h3>\r\n<p>The insurance plans and policies you choose to accept will change from year to year based on your business&#8217;s needs. Fortunately, keeping updated insurance listings on your website can help you hold onto devoted patients in spite of a potential drop in coverage. For many people, loyalty to a particular doctor, dentist, or office is far more important than loyalty to the current insurance company.

By focusing on appealing to more users with unique, eye-catching photos, you have a better chance at ranking higher on search engines and improving your overall SEO. Learn how to take your digital marketing efforts a step further by including pictures of your office on your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Knowing when to use stock or original photos</h2>\r\n<p>While using unique imagery throughout your company website would be ideal for most effectively branding your company, it is not always practical to include an original photograph every time you need an image on a page.

Some of these photos are very high-quality, effective photographs and can be used for your ads and campaigns in situations where you need to save money and get the image out right away. While these photos may be professional quality, most people can tell the image came from a stock image site, so use these sparingly. </p>\r\n<h3>When to use original photos</h3>\r\n<p>Original photos are images that you produce in-house by either taking your own pictures or hiring a professional photographer. Using your own pictures is most essential when you are trying to create a personal connection with your patients and show them the faces behind your company. By including pictures of staff members and using real photos of your office throughout the website, your potential patients get to know you better and are more likely to choose to use your services with you as a result.</p>\r\n<h2>Making your images SEO friendly</h2>\r\n<p>While it is almost always better to use your own images on your site, you still need to pay attention to how they are being used to have the best ranking.

For many patients,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/posting-blogs-on-open-enrollment/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that insurance plays a vital role in patients getting needed healthcare services. For many patients, financial difficulties limit what care is available, and having a reliable insurance policy can help overcome this barrier. As a physician or other healthcare provider it is necessary that you inform patients about open enrollment periods and help them find policies that work well for each unique situation. This medical marketing strategy ensures that your patients are able to continue using your practice for essential health needs.</p>\r\n<h2>FAQs about open enrollment</h2>\r\n<p>Many doctors tend to stay away from any discussion about insurance with patients. However, it is important that you inform patients when open enrollment is available so that you can be an advocate for your patients getting the care they deserve. When patients are not concerned about financial barriers to care, your practice will see more appointments made and procedures accepted. </p>\r\n<h3>What is open enrollment?</h3>\r\n<p>There is a narrow window of time that insurance companies allow patients to sign up for policies. It often only happens once a year, so it is important that patients do not miss the opportunity. Sometimes insurance companies host an enrollment day at the patient&#8217;s job if the company has a group health plan. Other times, though, the patient may be required to contact the insurance company individually. For patients turning 65, assistance with signing up for a Medicare policy can be beneficial.</p>\r\n<h3>Why is it an important marketing strategy? </h3>\r\n<p>To establish a credible, trusting relationship with your patients, you must be able to guide them through every part of receiving healthcare. Insurance coverage is one thing that many patients struggle with. By informing your patients of available insurance options and making sure that they sign up on time, you are securing that patient in your practice for the coming year. You do not want to lose an established patient simply because they forgot to sign back up on an insurance plan and can no longer afford your services. </p>\r\n<h3>How can a practice get the word out to patients?</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to reminding patients at every appointment when insurance enrollment will begin, having a practice blog can greatly benefit you. According to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY\">NBC News</a>, approximately 80% of internet users have looked up some type of health information online. We are living in a connected society, and it is important that you have a place for your patients to read credible health information. <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">Your blog</a> can also be a great outlet for reminding patients of things like open enrollment, and updating it often helps your patients feel more connected to your practice at all times.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about our services</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is committed to providing effective SEO marketing strategies for your practice.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most. Digital marketing can help your practice adapt and grow in the aftermath of COVID-19.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Are Here to Help </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unsure if your dental practice is ready for the digital landscape, we can help.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
