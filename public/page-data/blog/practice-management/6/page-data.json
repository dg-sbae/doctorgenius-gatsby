Furthermore, a practice that invests in marketing spending has a much higher chance of surpassing their competitors. Here are some important ways it can help your practice thrive.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a brand</h2>\r\n<p>Brand differentiation, or distinguishing yourself from the rest, may seem more the purview of high-end fashion companies. Still, it is one of the most essential goals marketing spending can achieve. Which dentist is a consumer going to choose, the one who has a stellar reputation or the one who is just a “normal dentist”? Of course, there is no substitute for quality work, but marketing spending can amplify the service you provide and help your practice grow.</p>\r\n<p>Brand building in a consumer-savvy market may be difficult, but consider that one of your greatest assets are your people. In a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx\">Gallup survey</a> of more than 1,600 customers in three different service categories, researchers found that one of the biggest determining factors that affected a consumer’s decision to stay loyal to a brand was their interactions with customer-facing employees.</p>\r\n<p>In your practice, you and your employees are the ones who are fulfilling the promise that your brand makes. If consumers have a positive experience with you that reinforces that branding in your advertising, they will be more likely to come back and recommend the practice to others.</p>\r\n<p>Another creative way to build a brand is through <a title=\"Backlink\" href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\">content marketing</a>. Many consumers are tired of being bombarded by ads trying to sell them something, but content marketing allows your practice to present helpful information to a potential customer through a blog or video. This way the customer connects the helpful content to you and your practice and will be more likely to think of you when they need services. It also provides the opportunity for you to build an original brand through your content.</p>\r\n<h2>Effective advertising</h2>\r\n<p>In the digital age, there are myriad avenues of advertisement. No longer can practices only advertise on television or radio; they must also consider the various advertising opportunities on the internet. Whether social media, search engine, or pay-per-click advertising, the right choice is determined by your practice and your competition. Either way, it is strongly recommended that part of your marketing budget be dedicated to digital advertising even when marketing during recessions. More specific examples of digital advertising are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Facebook ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Google search ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Search engine optimization </li>\r\n\t<li>Geo-targeted ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Social media posts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Which type of ad is most effective depends on the practice, but it is a good idea to consider using a mix of ads rather than spending all your resources on one platform.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you organize your marketing spending</h2>\r\n<p>Each practice has different marketing needs.

While<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/qualifying-events-for-patients-marriage/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>People typically only have one opportunity to enroll in an employee benefit program, unless there are other qualifying events. While certain events might not be on people&#8217;s radar, most know that marriage constitutes a life event. A patient getting married who is satisfied with the current benefits program can be more likely to remain enrolled. Conversely, those who are dissatisfied may see an opportunity to drop their coverage.</p>\r\n<h2>Increasing employee satisfaction with benefits</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ways to create a positive patient experience for clients so a life event like marriage is a reason for them to increase current coverage rather than leave.</p>\r\n<h3>Provide multiple channels for connection</h3>\r\n<p>Traditionally, patients are reminded about yearly examinations or upcoming appointments with a flyer in their mailbox or a phone call. A reminder about an open enrollment period or life event from a benefits provider can also jog their memory. In addition to these methods, it can be helpful to send out notifications through text messages or emails. While this usually requires client consent, it can be more effective not only in getting patients to keep their appointments but also in helping them have a positive experience.</p>\r\n<p>You may also want to consider allowing patients to make or change appointments through a portal available on the company website. This can encourage clients to take control of their health care and make scheduling their responsibility. </p>\r\n<h3>Encourage staff interaction </h3>\r\n<p>Patients who feel supported by every staff member they come into contact with can be more likely to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207234/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207234/\">feel valued as a client</a>. Each time an employee walks by patients without smiling or acknowledging them in some way, patients may feel less like a person and more like a case number. When all staff members make patient care a top priority, it can encourage not only patient loyalty but also an increased sense of urgency regarding personal health care. Clients who feel valued by health care providers can be more likely to not only be pleased with their benefits package but also to recommend remaining with their current providers to a new spouse.   </p>\r\n<h3>Offer affordable payment plans</h3>\r\n<p>It is unrealistic to think all treatments can be offered at affordable rates. However, expecting clients to pay a premium out of pocket for treatment can result in fewer patients agreeing to certain procedures. The following are options for payment that patients often prefer:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Financing</li>\r\n\t<li>Monthly installment payments made directly to the medical practice</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduced cost for paying the total upfront with <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/paying-medical-bills-with-no-health-insurance-2385907\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/paying-medical-bills-with-no-health-insurance-2385907\">cash</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Making both elective and necessary treatments more affordable can encourage patients to see health care as a more affordable option. </p>\r\n<h2>Discover more ways to keep clients during qualifying events</h2>\r\n<p>Sometimes, increasing client retention can be accomplished by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/plans\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/plans\">restructuring your website</a> to make it more attractive and user-friendly.

Some states offer<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/keeping-patients-when-children-move-off-of-family-plans/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Per the Affordable Care Act, insurers phase young adults off their parents’ insurance plans by their mid-20s. Some states offer more flexibility and allow adult children to remain health care dependents until they are 30. As a provider, it is important that you understand your state’s particular rules and have a backup plan in place for when a young patient, inevitably, finds him or herself without coverage.</p>\r\n<h2>Age requirements for extended health care coverage</h2>\r\n<p>Prior to the passage of the ACA, 37 states had already adopted a policy that granted young adults the option to remain on their parents’ health plans beyond the age of 18. However, to protect those adults living in the 13 other states that have a hard cut-off age of 19, the Obama Administration included a provision within the Affordable Care Act that states a young adult can remain on a parent’s insurance plan until the age of 26. While states can continue with their existing state law requirements for extended coverage, they may not interfere with the application of the ACA.</p>\r\n<p>Per most states’ laws, the cut-off age was 25. Several state laws mandated that individuals be full-time students, unmarried, without dependents of their own, and residents of the state to qualify for benefits. Some went so far as to say that a dependent must reside in the same home as the policyholder. The ACA merely gave young adults in these states a year-longer grace period without severely disrupting insurers’ policies.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the extra year grace period, the ACA made it easier for young adults to <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/children-under-26/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/children-under-26/\">qualify for dependent coverage</a>. Per the law, any person younger than the age of 26 may remain on a parent’s health insurance plan even if the following apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The dependent starts or leaves school</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent gets married</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent is no longer considered a dependent for tax purposes</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent lives in or out of the family home</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent has or adopts a child</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent was offered, but turned down, employer-based coverage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When coverage stops after a person turns 26 depends on the type of plan a parent has. If a parent has a marketplace plan, the dependent may remain on the policy until the end of the year he or she turns 26. The child must use the open enrollment or special enrollment period (whichever comes first) to apply for individual coverage. If a parent has a job-based plan, the dependent’s coverage ends at the end of his or her birthday month.</p>\r\n<h2>States with extended coverage</h2>\r\n<p>Several states grant young adults even more leeway by allowing <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/dependent-health-coverage-state-implementation.aspx\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/dependent-health-coverage-state-implementation.aspx\">extended dependent coverage up until the age of 30</a>. For instance, Florida allows young, unmarried individuals who do not have dependents of their own to remain on their parents’ plans until the age of 30. In Illinois, parents of dependents who are also veterans may do the same. Other states that extend dependent coverage beyond age 26 include Wisconsin (27), South Dakota (29), New York (30), Pennsylvania (30) and New Jersey (31). These states generally require an adult child to remain unmarried and dependent-free to qualify for extended coverage.</p>\r\n<h2>Special enrollment periods</h2>\r\n<p>As a health care provider, you have a responsibility to your patients to advise them on what they can do to improve their health and quality of life. Part of doing both involves ensuring patients have adequate coverage. If you learn that a patient is about to be phased off a parent’s insurance plan, encourage them to conduct research early on, as they have limited time to enroll in a new plan.</p>\r\n<p>Patients whose parents have marketplace coverage have a 120-day window to apply for coverage. This special enrollment window begins 60 days before one’s 26th birthday and ends 60 days afterward.</p>\r\n<p>The special enrollment period for individuals whose parents have employer-based coverage is slightly shorter. It begins 60 days before a person’s 26th birthday but ends only 30 days after the big day. Individuals who miss the special enrollment period must wait for <a href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/individual-and-family/2020-obamacare-open-enrollment-dates-by-state/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/individual-and-family/2020-obamacare-open-enrollment-dates-by-state/\">open enrollment</a>, which begins November 1st and ends December 15th. (California’s open enrollment period is slightly longer, beginning on October 15th and ending January 31st.)</p>\r\n<h2>Coverage options beyond 26</h2>\r\n<p>Most people are partial to their doctors or dentists and will do what is necessary to remain a patient. However, because cost is almost always a factor, you may lose a young patient who cannot afford your services to a cheaper competitor or clinic. You can take steps to prevent this from happening by informing patients of affordable coverage alternatives. Some options to discuss with young adults are as follows.</p>\r\n<h3>Shop through the exchange</h3>\r\n<p>The health care exchange is a young person’s best bet for finding affordable coverage. Advise patients that if their income is between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line, they may qualify for tax credits to help subsidize the cost of health care coverage.</p>\r\n<h3>Find coverage through school or an employer</h3>\r\n<p>Many universities offer affordable coverage to students. If a patient is not a student, encourage him or her to ask about job-based coverage.</p>\r\n<h3>Apply for Medicaid or CHIP</h3>\r\n<p>Medicaid is low- to no-cost health insurance available to individuals whose incomes fall below 138% of the federal poverty line. CHIP is a low-cost option for pregnant women.</p>\r\n<h3>Look into COBRA</h3>\r\n<p>COBRA allows a young adult to stay on their parent&#8217;s plan for up to 18 months after their 26<sup>th</sup> birthday. However, the policyholders must assume the cost of coverage, which can get expensive.</p>\r\n<h3>Check out catastrophic plans</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/catastrophic-insurance\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/catastrophic-insurance\">Catastrophic plans</a> are only available to people under 30. These plans come with high deductibles and assume the holder will not be using the benefits much, if at all. However, premiums are low, averaging about $173 per month.</p>\r\n<h2>We can help you retain patients</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is #1 in new patient acquisition, and we are not too bad at patient retention, either.

However, the saying that all press is good press is not true. Negative WOM is very damaging to a brand’s reputation and bottom line, especially when the brand in question is an “underdog.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>The effects of negative WOM marketing</strong></p>\r\n<p>WOM marketing relies on first-hand accounts of a person’s experience with a business. First-hand accounts are immediately more credible than typical marketing, as consumers do not get paid to leave reviews. Brands use positive testimonials to attract new customers for this reason. However, whereas positive reviews increase trust and influence purchases, negative reviews have an adverse effect. Below are just a few ways NWOM can undermine the results from all other marketing efforts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Change in attitude toward a brand</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the findings from a study conducted by a <a href=\"https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;context=honors_theses\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;context=honors_theses\">University of New Orleans</a>, consumers’ attitudes toward a brand are adversely impacted by negative reviews. The study focused on both “top dogs” and “underdogs.” While both big and small businesses saw a negative impact from public criticism, the underdogs suffered more from bad press than larger corporations. Additionally, participants’ perceived brand value decreased when they were presented with negative information about a company. Again, the drop was more significant for small brands than large ones.</p>\r\n<p>What is interesting is that positive reviews had little to no effect on participants’ perceptions of brands. This finding shows just how powerful negative word-of-mouth can be.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Change in purchase intention</strong></p>\r\n<p>Negative WOM does not just hurt a brand’s reputation. It also hurts a company’s bottom line. According to the study, negative reviews influenced participants not to make the purchase.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay.

It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
