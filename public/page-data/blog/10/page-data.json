In a world where many consumers and clients rely on<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Building a practice website for search engine optimization is important. In a world where many consumers and clients rely on what they read on the internet, having a page that ranks highly in search returns can make or break the traffic through your practice. When a potential client takes a look at your site, you want to be sure that you have created the kind of content marketing that keeps them reading and, even better, has them calling to make an appointment. One page you may want to consider incorporating is one that answers frequently asked questions. Since there are almost always general and common questions, getting them out of the way up front may improve the user&#8217;s impression of your practice immediately.</p>\r\n<h2>Reasons FAQ pages may help elevate your practice</h2>\r\n<p>Your main objective on your practice web page is to get potential clients interested in your business. You want to entice them with colorful pictures, engaging blog content, and convincing reasons why they should choose you. The FAQ page offers another opportunity to peak reader interest, and according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/02/12/making-seo-a-game-changer-for-your-business/#698e6b2e26c4\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/02/12/making-seo-a-game-changer-for-your-business/#698e6b2e26c4\">Forbes.com</a>, maximize SEO to elevate your practice&#8217;s web presence.</p>\r\n<h3>Establishes trust</h3>\r\n<p>Some medical issues may prove more difficult for clients to talk about than others. The FAQ section is the place where you can place sensitive and perhaps embarrassing client questions. As readers cycle through your site, give them the most uncomfortable queries relevant to your practice, and answer them in simple terms. This not only establishes you as an authority but as a practice that makes people feel at ease.</p>\r\n<h3>Informs clients</h3>\r\n<p>You should have information about your practice plastered all over your site. Including some <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-presenting-content-in-more-than-one-form/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-presenting-content-in-more-than-one-form/\">facts and figures in the FAQ section</a> can go a long way with potential clients. Doing it here can serve a couple of purposes. It gives information to those who want to read about it. You also can control how insight into your practice is presented and what you choose to provide.</p>\r\n<h3>Allows interaction</h3>\r\n<p>Establishing a page that does not allow readers to interact with you may turn some people away. If set up correctly, the FAQ page can allow you to field questions from readers and add them to the list you have already compiled. Answering comments or questions shows potential clients that you are attentive and care enough to address further queries. </p>\r\n<h3>Captures searches</h3>\r\n<p>Frequently asked questions contain common SEO keywords. When a person starts looking for these terms, your FAQ page may come back in the search. When this happens, it gives your website more visibility and may even net you a new client. Ensuring that your entire site is SEO friendly can work to drive more business to your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>We have solutions</h2>\r\n<p>Our team of pros at Doctor Genius is dedicated to working diligently towards getting your practice&#8217;s website optimized for maximum traction.

The internet has made it easier than ever for consumers to find providers beyond their local regions and to consult with physicians states or even countries away. While this ease of access is great for individuals, it creates a highly competitive landscape for health care providers, as you may well know. As a result, you as a provider should continually look for opportunities to optimize your site not just for search, but for local search. While SEO content is one of the strongest ways to do this, structured data — or “schema markup” — can put you well ahead of the competition.  </p>\r\n<h2>Understanding structured data</h2>\r\n<p>Structured data markup helps define information in such a way that the search bots can better understand the context of your page, delivering “rich snippets.” HTML, on the other hand, simply tells the bots how to display text included in a tag.</p>\r\n<p>Neil Patel explains the <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.\">ins and outs of schema markup</a>. In a nutshell, schema markup can help you create a virtual business card. While non-marked-up results pull from title tags and meta descriptions to return generic information about your practice, marked-up results can show users everything from your practice’s name to its ratings to its hours, all right there in the SERPs. Before rich snippets were introduced, this kind of data — numbers, ratings, etc. — were not understood by the search bots and, therefore, ignored.</p>\r\n<h2>Using structured data to reach local patients</h2>\r\n<p>The most obvious way structured data can help you reach and attract local patients is by helping Google read items such as your map and phone number so it can include that information in the SERPs. While your content probably mentions your city and state several times for SEO purposes, schema markup makes it possible to show potential patients exactly where you are located, down to the suite number.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, location is just one factor patients consider before selecting a provider. Patients also want to find a provider who is in the right field, who offers their insurance, and who has stellar patient reviews. Unlike HTML tags, which offer you limited space to tell searchers what your practice is about, structured data lets you <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0\">describe a page in as detailed a manner as possible</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For example, in the “@type” section, you can describe the type of content your page promises. In the “@description” section, you can include what you do (“A cosmetic dentist with 15 years of perfecting smiles.”) and/or a list of insurance your practice accepts. The “aggregate rating” section lets you input your best and worst ratings, and Google will deliver the average. All of the information you choose to put in your markup can help local searchers make the most informed decisions possible without them ever having to click through to your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Create meaningful results</h2>\r\n<p>From <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">writing for skimmers</a> to writing for the search bots, our team at Doctor Genius is familiar with the strongest tactics for attracting new patients and ranking well in the search engines.

Without the requisite knowledge to inform<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>As a medical provider, staying on top of new advances and developments is crucial. Without the requisite knowledge to inform patients of options and effectively treat them, you will not only suffer a loss of business, but you also may suffer a loss of professional integrity. While it is essential to stay grounded in older routines and those products that are still relevant, newer tools may provide more opportunities to attract new clients and offer new options to existing ones. Understanding what happens from the time medical products are introduced until they become irrelevant may help when it comes to medical marketing.</p>\r\n<h2>Staying informed of new trends</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to providing the best options for patient treatment, technological trends and developments are crucial. The ability to introduce patients to a full array of potential solutions to health problems results in a higher rate of successful recovery. Keeping an eye on medical journals, doing independent research on clinical trials, and speaking with an equipment representative may prove sufficient to stay abreast of trends.</p>\r\n<h2>The stages of medical products</h2>\r\n<p>Once a new medical product becomes available, company reps strive to reach relevant practices. The more medical providers use it and prescribe it, the higher the chance that it will gain notoriety. According to <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534\">thestreet.com</a>, typical product lifecycle management contains four benchmarks: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Each of these stages requires unique marketing strategies to remain competitive.</p>\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Bringing a new medical product to the market can prove difficult, especially if the first phase of the lifecycle is not successful. In the introduction, the company is trying to gain some awareness of the product. Activities during this time include promotions geared towards those medical practices that have patients who may benefit from the new product. </p>\r\n<h3>Growth</h3>\r\n<p>Once the product finds a measure of success, the distributor will want to broaden its horizons and target other areas of the medical community that might utilize it. The distributor may start to change the branding of the product to make it more appealing to a broader audience. Something used primarily for one health condition may be pushed for aiding with another. As long as the data backs up the claims, providers may give it a try.</p>\r\n<h3>Maturity</h3>\r\n<p>Business strategy changes the more successful a product becomes. When product sales plateau, it is a signal that it has reached maturity. To keep the company&#8217;s name at the forefront of the medical community, it now has to make some clear changes to the product or its marketing. In some cases, this results in a 2.0 version of the same item.</p>\r\n<h3>Decline</h3>\r\n<p>When competitors introduce rival products, and sales start to decrease, the lifecycle is declining. This means that a company must either completely reformulate and reintroduce the product or come up with something new.</p>\r\n<h2>Help when you need it</h2>\r\n<p>Convincing clients that your practice is on top of the latest medical products and trends gives them confidence that you are looking out for the best avenues for treatment.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.

Too<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-build-out-site-architecture/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Building a successful and beneficial website, both for your business and clients, requires more than an appealing visual layout. Too often, businesses focus on how a site looks when they should construct it with search engine optimization and information flow in mind. By building your website with clientele needs and <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\">SEO keywords</a> as the driving point, you are more likely to attract a larger target audience.</p>\r\n<h2>Steps to successfully build site architecture</h2>\r\n<p>Site architecture refers to every aspect of your website, including the smallest details that most visitors will not even see: design, layout, easy-to-read content, social media links, contact information, email list sign-ups, etc. Before jumping into design, start by identifying your goals and your customers. What do you want people to discover when landing on your homepage? What kind of visitors do you want your site to attract? Once you have defined these measures, you are ready to work on the following steps for building out your site architecture.</p>\r\n<h3>Find your keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Keywords are the essential tool customers use to find websites that are relevant to an online search. By incorporating the most commonly used keywords into your site, it is more likely to rank higher on the list of results. Consider using tools like Keyword Discovery or Wordtracker to explore keywords that fit your business and audience. Research the competitiveness of each keyword (how often it is used by others in your business), the frequency that each word or phrase is typed into search engines, and the specificity of them (if they are broad terms for customers beginning a search or specific terms for those who are looking for an exact product).</p>\r\n<h3>Create a site map</h3>\r\n<p>A site map is made up of the layers within your website that generate a natural flow of information and link one page to the next. The map is usually designed based on a hierarchical structure, with categories, tags, and backlinks that separate out information in a logical order. The map should be easy to navigate so that a visitor can quickly find the information they are looking for.</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on aesthetics</h3>\r\n<p>Now it is time to focus on your <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#395646be7645\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#395646be7645\">website’s appearance</a> and how well it functions for your audience. This is just as important as establishing keywords and a site map since this is the part the customer actually pays attention to. A website that is confusing to navigate or lacks a clear, concise message on the landing page is more likely to lose viewers quickly. Use headlines and a short blurb at the top of your homepage to inform people about your business and guide visitors toward relevant information. Pictures can help break up text and make a page easier to read.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more ways to improve site architecture</h2>\r\n<p>Building a website right the first time is essential to establish a loyal customer base and grow your business.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge.
