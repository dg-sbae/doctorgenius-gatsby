You need to have patients who will return for checkups after the initial visit. A strong Recall System will allow you to establish strong bonds of trust with the patient as a professional practice and ensure Patient Recall. While professionals can attempt to schedule appointments months ahead, the patient may move to another practice or cancel the appointment. Doctor Genius is hosting a webinar event for clients to learn new tips and methods for an improved Patient Recall System.\r\n<h3>The webinar event you don’t want to miss</h3>\r\nPatient Recall is a crucial step of anyone’s practice and not having an effective system in place can hinder the chance of patients returning. We will cover tips and methods for developing an effective Patient Recall System that will help retain patients and bring more through the doors. The webinar event will take place from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017.\r\n\r\nA few simple steps that are essential for effective patient recall include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Phone call reminders for a regular dental checkup</li>\r\n \t<li>Sending postcards with practice contact info to patients with reminder</li>\r\n \t<li>Creating an automated recall system</li>\r\n \t<li>Adding patients who do not reply to all reminders onto an overdue recall list</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhile many professional practices may pre-schedule the phone, email, or postcard reminders about an appointment, patients may still end up canceling. This webinar will cover how to implement effective recall methods into a practice.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-312\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>New recall tactics from a professional consultant</h3>\r\nProfessional consultant, David Orr, owner of Alliance Dental Consulting in Irvine, CA, works to understand and develop dental practices to help them reach greater levels of success. Orr will share tips on his confirmation system with listeners during the webinar.\r\n\r\nThe confirmation system begins by sending a card in the mail or an email to the patient 28 days before the appointment, requesting confirmation. Since some patients may not respond immediately, consistency is key. Orr will also cover steps with basic recall, overdue recall, responding to missed appointments, unscheduled treatment and more. Orr will go over how to effectively continue keeping up contacting with the patient and increasing patient recall with his system in the webinar.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we produce professional content for dental practices and help practices create a stronger online presence.

Even with a website and digital presence, medical professionals will experience difficulty in reaching clients of all ages. The fastest growing buying group in the market and the age group professionals seem to have difficulty marketing to more than others, is millennials. Fortunately, Doctor Genius is working with other companies to offer a CE event on the best methods for marketing to millennials.\r\n<h3>Event details</h3>\r\nThe event itself takes place at the Marriott Courtyard in Sherman Oaks, CA, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on February 16, 2016. The registration fee is $25, which includes dinner provided at the event. Others can attend this continuing education (CE) class to earn three credits as well. The focus of the event is to showcase proven marketing methods that attract and return millennial clients including:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Active websites packed with fresh, unique and tailored content for specific practices</li>\r\n \t<li>Effective branding strategies to give practices an edge in competitive markets</li>\r\n \t<li>The importance of active social media profiles</li>\r\n \t<li>The most effective retention methods to promote client loyalty</li>\r\n \t<li>The use of search marketing to find the keywords that clients select most</li>\r\n \t<li>Management of your practice reviews to follow what current clients are saying</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis event will cover many more topics and information on reaching millennial clients. For the event, Doctor Genius is collaborating with Patterson Dental, Bank of America, Nickerson Consulting, Revenue Well and CARR Healthcare Realty. Experienced speakers from these companies, operating in today’s competitive market, will present proven methods of reaching and retaining millennial clients.\r\n<h3>Easier said than done</h3>\r\nThe PEW Research Center finds that 81 percent of millennials are on Facebook and that only 19 percent of millennials “say that most people can be trusted.” This statistic makes it even more crucial for medical professionals to be able to build a strong bond to retain millennial clients. Millennials are a large group of possible clients who mainly connect with each other over social media platforms. A practice that has a successful online presence and active accounts in the digital market can effectively reach millennials.\r\n\r\nWhile most people can construct a website for any known service, keeping the website active, healthy, updated and on the first page of search results is difficult to do. Doctor Genius offers these services and more, using this CE event to go over the most effective methods for maintaining a strong presence among millennial clients. The event will have a plethora of advice from top industry speakers and marketing advice from companies of various backgrounds.
