If you have seen <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\" target=\"_blank\">Johns Hopkins University’s heat map of coronavirus COVID-19 global cases,</a> you may be feeling lost and confused about interpreting the actual and logarithmic data, along with the daily cases reported. The high numbers of confirmed cases and deaths may seem intimidating, but what do they really mean in the grand scheme of things?</p> \r\n<h2>Actual vs. Logarithmic Data</h2>\r\n<p>On the Johns Hopkins University graph for actual data, data is spaced out by every 20,000 cases. In other words, the chart is spaced out linearly and evenly. This is known as an arithmetic graph, where equal distances represent equal amounts. Most people are most familiar with this type of chart because of its straightforward nature.</p>\r\n<p>The JHU graph for logarithmic data, however, spaces out data from 10 to 1,000 to 100,000. Instead of representing equal amounts, equal distances represent equal rates. In this case, each distance represents 10%. This makes it more useful in comparing rates of change.</p>\r\n<h2>Daily Rates of COVID-19 Growth</h2>\r\n<p>It would be easy to interpret the JHU graph for actual data as proof that the daily rates of (1) novel coronavirus growth outside of mainland China and (2) total recovered worldwide have been skyrocketing since February. Looking at this graph may be disheartening, as it seems to indicate an unstoppable daily uptick in novel coronavirus cases.</p>\r\n<p>However, the logarithmic data shows us that the daily growth rates of COVID-19 outside of mainland China are <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-data-do-not-support-global-alarmism-by-anatole-kaletsky-2020-03\" target=\"_blank\">actually slowing down.</a></p>\r\n<h2>Interpreting COVID-19 Maps</h2>\r\n<p>Some may also find it panic-inducing to look at JHU’s map. It is crucial to remember that the data presented does not give viewers an idea of the number of cases relative to the population. In other words, the map is using actual data. By failing to list population numbers and focusing only on COVID-19-related statistics, the map may render viewers unable to establish a baseline for comparison.</p>\r\n<p>JHU’s map partially compensates for this by implementing proportional symbols in marking each region, meaning larger circles represent larger numbers of cumulative confirmed cases. Thus, viewers may be able to see which countries are more affected than others — though not proportionately so.</p>\r\n<h2>Significance of Current Data</h2>\r\n<p>The actual data suggests that cases exploded in mainland China from mid-January to early February before finally beginning to flatten out in mid-February. Additionally, the graph indicates that the total recovery rate has been on the rise. Logarithmic data confirms both of these assumptions while simultaneously showing that recovery rates may be leveling out — likely correlated with the overall slowing of new COVID-19 diagnoses.</p>\r\n<p>All of this indicates that flattening the curve is still very possible, provided individuals <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/\" target=\"_blank\">stick to necessary precautions like social distancing.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the high numbers reported in COVID-19 statistics may be intimidating, they must be taken in context. Understanding how to correctly interpret the data on COVID-19 is imperative in reducing sensationalism and panic. Staying calm and keeping a clear head can help aid you in taking the preventative steps needed to keep both yourself and those around you safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

In times like these, however, this may be easier said than done. The recent pandemic-designation of COVID-19 puts medical professionals in a particularly unique position. You may be asking yourself what to do if you run out of supplies, no matter what kind of medicine you practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Protective Gear</h2>\r\n<p>As coronavirus continues to spread, it is crucial for medical professionals to keep themselves safe. After all, patients can only be treated if there is someone available to provide professional treatment. This is true regardless of practice type and whether or not the patient is known to have coronavirus. Currently, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> recommends that healthcare workers wear:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Goggles or face shield (for eye protection)</li>\r\n<li>Respirator or medical mask (ideally, an N95 respirator)</li>\r\n<li>Gown (closed securely at the back)</li>\r\n<li>Gloves (pulled up over gown sleeves)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Alternatively, workers may wear powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) that cover the entire head. There is still much we do not yet know about COVID-19. As such, authorities recommend taking higher-level protections until more information on the virus’s transmissibility is known.</p>\r\n<h2>N95 Respirator Shortage</h2>\r\n<p>Hospitals and other healthcare professionals generally only order as many supplies as they anticipate they will need. This, in conjunction with a slew of other factors amid the coronavirus outbreak, has led to a nationwide shortage of N95 respirators.</p>\r\n<p>Healthcare professionals should also advise their patients not to wear respirators or surgical masks unless they are already sick with coronavirus, as this may further contribute to the shortage. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/healthcare-supply-ppe.html\" target=\"_blank\">For most healthy people,</a> wearing respirators and surgical masks will not do much to prevent contracting COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h2>Rationing N95 Respirators</h2>\r\n<p>As the shortage continues to worsen, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/release-stockpiled-N95.html\" target=\"_blank\">the CDC has approved</a> using N95 respirators for “repeated close contact encounters with several patients,” despite being marked as single-use. They may also be used beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, alternative options are available. <a href=\"http://www.wsha.org/wp-content/uploads/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The World Health Organization (WHO)</a> recommends using surgical masks to protect against droplets when N95 respirators are unavailable. Such protection is inadequate, however, when performing aerosol-generating procedures.</p>\r\n<h2>Other Supply Shortages</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/03/us-america-has-fraction-medical-supplies-it-needs-to-combat-coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\">In an interview with National Geographic</a>, senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Center Eric Toner states, “In terms of the amount masks, gowns, gloves, [and] respirators that would be needed.” Toner adds, “I don’t see any reason to think that we would need a different number of those things than we do for a severe pandemic flu.”</p>\r\n<p>The CDC’s models for a potential public health emergency estimate that American healthcare workers will need <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_1/S42/356585\" target=\"_blank\">7,000 to 11,000 mechanical ventilators</a> and <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_1/S42/356585\" target=\"_blank\">100 to 400 million surgical masks</a> for the least to most severe scenarios, respectively. However, anticipating actual supply and demand is difficult when the outbreak’s attack rate is still undetermined.</p>\r\n<h2>What Healthcare Professionals Can Do</h2>\r\n<p>In anticipation of a possible lockdown, healthcare professionals should make sure to supply their patients with a sufficient amount of prescription refills as necessary. It is crucial to take proper precautions and not skip any necessary preventative measures out of fear of running out. Order any masks, gowns, gloves, and respirators while possible, along with any other supplies you anticipate needing. Ration out any supplies carefully and reuse what can be safely reused. If your N95 supplies are running low or you have run out entirely, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html\" target=\"_blank\">follow the CDC protocol</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the U.S. government has incentivized manufacturers to increase the production of surgical masks and respirators by <a href=\"https://qz.com/1811316/us-will-buy-excess-coronavirus-face-masks-to-encourage-production/\" target=\"_blank\">promising to buy any that are left over once demand has run dry</a>. The Strategic National Stockpile, which has a record of proven success during previous epidemics, has also asked manufacturers to <a href=\"https://beta.sam.gov/opp/84a00a52e4e243318a0d2496dc431e36/view?keywords=masks&#038;sort=-modifiedDate&#038;index=&#038;is_active=true&#038;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">submit data on their inventories of personal protective equipment</a>. If necessary, the stockpile may be able to supply healthcare workers with any antibiotics (both oral and antibiotic) and any other medical equipment that could prove useful.</p>\r\n<p>We know that these are stressful times. You want to keep your practice afloat, treat your patients successfully, and protect yourself from the virus all at once. Staying informed and taking steps to prepare may be able to help lessen your anxieties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p><i>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Not only have traders seen the effects of the virus, but<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-covid-19-may-affect-the-healthcare-industry/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to greatly impact the global economy. Not only have traders seen the effects of the virus, but now the overall U.S. economy is seeing them too. On Monday, all three major stock indexes fell at least 12%, and The Federal Reserve cut interest rates. As cases rise, more businesses are shutting their doors to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>The healthcare industry is one of the economic sectors affected by the outbreak. This pandemic may put considerable stress on hospitals, medical practices, and health care workers. It is difficult to accurately predict how the system will hold up under the potential influx of patients. Things like revenue, supplies, staffing, billing, and resources will likely be affected. How it reacts will likely impact future changes to the U.S. healthcare system.</p>\r\n<h2>Changes and Risks For Healthcare Workers</h2>\r\n<p>Given that they care for infected individuals, medical workers are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 than those in other fields. As hospital and doctor visits for the virus rise, it could pose a greater risk for healthcare workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends following their own <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/steps-to-prepare.html\" target=\"_blank\">procedure and guidelines</a> to help prevent those in the healthcare industry and their patients from getting sick. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has also published a detailed article about <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html\" target=\"_blank\">working during the outbreak of this virus</a>.</p>   \r\n<p>One subset of the medical sector that is benefiting from COVID-19 is telehealth. Telehealth is a category of healthcare services that provides doctor visits remotely. In recent weeks, telehealth companies and their affiliated medical practices have experienced an increase in business and attention. In anticipation of this, Congress passed a bill which <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/telehealth-benefits-medicare-are-lifeline-patients-during-coronavirus-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">waived telehealth service restrictions to seniors on Medicare.</a> This could be an effective way to limit exposure and mitigate the spread of the virus while still receiving medical care.</p>  \r\n<h2>Impact On Dental Practices</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 outbreak also affects dentists and their staff. On Monday, the American Dental Association (ADA) <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2020-archive/march/ada-recommending-dentists-postpone-elective-procedures\" target=\"_blank\">recommended that dentists postpone elective procedures</a> for at least three weeks. This was outlined in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. The ADA specified that dental offices should focus on treating patients with urgent and emergency cases so that those with these levels of dental issues will not be placing additional stress on already overworked hospitals. Additionally, the CDC has issued <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/summary-infection-prevention-practices/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a> to dental offices for preventing the spread of the virus.</p>\r\n<h2>COVID-19 Funding Bill</h2>\r\n<p>The President signed an $8.3 billion <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6074/text\" target=\"_blank\">emergency spending bill</a> on Friday aimed at treating and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Over $3 billion of the bill fund went to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use flexibly. $950 million went to fund state and local health sectors for things like staffing and other critical needs. Additionally, $300 million went toward vaccine and treatment research, development, and production. Lastly, $1.25 billion went to international activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dental practices, medical practices, and businesses will likely see several changes during the COVID-19 outbreak. While these changes may present new challenges, companies can implement changes of their own to help navigate the changing landscape. It is vital to remain informed and utilize resources provided by the government and other organizations so that businesses can better adapt to the COVID-19 environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
