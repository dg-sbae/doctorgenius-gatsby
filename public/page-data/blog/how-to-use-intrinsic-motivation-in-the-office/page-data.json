This type of employee wants to be highly thought of and produce quality work. Intrinsic motivators can be some of the most compelling reasons why individuals choose to work in the medical field. Let&#8217;s examine ways to take advantage of intrinsic motivation in a medical office.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Get rid of preconceived ideas about motivation</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.tutor2u.net/business/reference/motivation-pink-three-elements-of-intrinsic-motivation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Daniel Pink</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, a well-known author and speaker about motivation, the common tendency is to think of motivation as either based on fear or excitement. Many people are motivated by the fear of failure, disappointing others, or punishment. As well, just about everyone appears to work harder when excited by the promise of a reward, either in the form of a compliment or a bonus. While these things may be true, though, they are not necessarily the primary reasons for people&#8217;s actions. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Discover what truly motivates your staff members</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When office management is aware of the primary reasons employees are motivated, managers can both help staff members to thrive and encourage them to be more productive. This in turn can enhance the patient experience. Here are three main intrinsic motivators to consider.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The ability to self-manage</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This can be a struggle for many management teams, because the traditional office system requires employees to comply with orders and dutifully complete tasks without question. However, allowing staff members to self-direct can be an excellent way to get them more engaged in their work. It can also open the door for them to present thoughts or ideas related to the job and the improvement of related processes or programs. It is critical to find a balance between assigning tasks and allowing employees to suggest them. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The desire for self-improvement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Progress and personal achievement can be incredible motivators. When people improve because they want to rather than because they are told to, the results come much faster and last much longer. The trick with implementing this type of motivator is to assign tasks that are not too difficult but go beyond the basics of what is commonly performed by the employee. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The desire to connect with a bigger cause</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most people want to do things that make a difference or leave a lasting impression. Menial tasks tend to be a disincentive or deterrence to job satisfaction. Because the bulk of an employee&#8217;s daytime hours are typically spent at work, it can be much more motivating when that work matters in a meaningful way. A key way to introduce this in a medical office is to </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/communicate-new-mission-vision-30929.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">clearly communicate</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> the goals, values, and mission of the company. Understanding how their role within the office matters can allow employees to feel they are contributing to the greater good. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Motivate your office</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tapping into the intrinsic motivators of your medical office staff can help employees get more enjoyment out of their jobs, increase productivity, and even improve the patient experience.

There is a good chance that your targeted audience may first interact with your brand on a social media platform before ever encountering your website. Having a strong strategy will allow you to build brand awareness, create good organic posts, and convert qualified leads.</p>\r\n<h2>Setting up Your Social Media Accounts for Success</h2>\r\n<p>Now is a great time to get started if your business does not have any social media accounts yet. Take time to evaluate which platforms may be the most beneficial for your company, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>\r\n<h3>Understand the Different Social Platforms</h3>\r\n<p>Having a general understanding of the various social platforms, the type of content, and the audience they attract can help you set up your accounts effectively. For example, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/\">Instagram statistics</a> show the site is most popular among younger adults aged 18 to 34. On the other hand. LinkedIn&#8217;s primary users are between the ages of 46 and 55 years old.</p>\r\n<h3>Create a Brand Identity</h3>\r\n<p>Your office branding should be consistent everywhere people may interact with it. If your company has designed a logo, this image should appear on your signs, marketing collateral, company website, and social media platforms.</p>\r\n<h3>Identify Your Goals</h3>\r\n<p>Run the numbers to evaluate where your company currently is at versus where you need it to be. If your office is already active on social media, identify which areas you need to improve on and focus on those.  Investing in building brand awareness is important to do before directing your efforts towards lead generation and conversions.</p>\r\n<h3>Balance Paid and Organic Content</h3>\r\n<p>When using social media, businesses have two main tools to reach people and direct them towards a specific action: paid advertisements and organic content. Your office does not have to have a large following to reach your intended audience, as most sites do not post your ads on your account. Using paid ads can help you get page likes and present your brand to people who fit your target demographic.</p>\r\n<p>Organic content includes posts on your page. Keep up on posting and engage with your audience to establish your brand and draw potential patients to your office. When done correctly, this can help boost your website’s SEO ranking by encouraging backlinking to highly shared content and increasing the number of branded searches on search engines from people who interact with your office on social media.</p>\r\n<p>Build Brand Awareness and Boost SEO With Social Media</p>\r\n<p>In today’s digital world, social media is a necessary aspect of a business.

Because the<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/5-cost-accounting-tips-for-a-medical-practice/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Although it is a newer concept, cost accounting can be very beneficial for medical practices of all sizes. Because the demand to lower the cost of health care is becoming more urgent, it can be helpful to streamline the process of eliminating unnecessary expenses by understanding and implementing this type of accounting system. </p>\r\n<h2>What is cost accounting?</h2>\r\n<p>A cost accounting system focuses on recording, classifying, and allocating the expenses of a company to help determine the actual cost of services and products. The idea is when the exact uses of funds are known, costs of services and products can not only be clearly defined but also reduced. This accounting method can also help pinpoint the profitability of specific ventures or expenditures so more well-informed decisions can be made about future purchases or endeavors.</p>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/healthcare-cost-accounting-8-strategies-to-streamline-implementation-and-quickly-achieve-measurable-results.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/healthcare-cost-accounting-8-strategies-to-streamline-implementation-and-quickly-achieve-measurable-results.html\">Becker&#8217;s Hospital CFO Report</a>, the main obstacle to overcome when trying to implement a cost accounting system is creating an accurate Relative Value Unit without being overwhelmed or confused by the math. Because the RVU ultimately helps to determine the costs associated with the charge description master, which can be extensive and complex, it is important to establish clear, correct RVUs before proceeding further. It is also crucial to have the cooperation of everyone involved with the practice since efficient communication of data can be a large part of the process. </p>\r\n<h2>5 ways to make cost accounting work for a medical practice</h2>\r\n<p>There are differences between how a traditional company and a medical practice operate, but an accounting method like this can work particularly well in a service industry where costs are tied more to time and expertise than products. Here are some tips to help your medical practice implement an effective cost accounting system. </p>\r\n<h3>1. Delegate to responsible team members</h3>\r\n<p>Rather than having one person attempt to figure out all the RVUs alone, it can be helpful to get other staff members involved. Especially for larger practices with multiple departments, tasking a tenured, capable staff member from each department with compiling specific RVUs can speed the process up quite a bit. Even for smaller practices, enlisting the assistance of staff members who are familiar with the services and products can help establish these amounts more accurately. When deciding who to select for the assignment, take into consideration factors such as how well the employee knows the CDM codes, resource consumption, and operating procedures. </p>\r\n<h3>2. Ensure the correct CDM codes are being used</h3>\r\n<p>Aside from their importance for cost accounting, correct CDM usage is beneficial for patients and medical practices alike to ensure proper billing and insurance charges. Because CDM codes play a significant role in defining the RVUs, CDMs used incorrectly can result in inaccurate numbers. Charges are also becoming increasingly automated, and some software does not require individual service codes to be entered manually. Before relying on CDM codes to help generate RVUs, it can be important to revisit how the codes are being applied to get the most accurate RVUs possible. According to the <a href=\"https://www.hfma.org/topics/article/57212.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hfma.org/topics/article/57212.html\">Healthcare Financial Management Association</a>, respondents to a survey reported the area that most needed improvement was statistics and RVUs. This shows team members are aware of a deficiency and may welcome additional training in this area. </p>\r\n<h3>3. Utilize all available techniques and data</h3>\r\n<p>It is not necessary to develop all the RVUs from scratch. For some services and products, there will be information such as actual cost, industry-standard RVUs, and staffing ratios that allow the RVU to be determined quickly. In many cases, the actual cost of products is known or can be determined easily by contacting the vendor rep. Some factors, such as time spent on a service or clinical skill level required, are also fairly objective and can be used to develop a standardized RVU. In many cases, a minimum cost for these factors already exists, and all that is left to do is determining how much the margin needs to increase to meet the fiscal needs of the practice. </p>\r\n<h3>4. Prioritize</h3>\r\n<p>There should naturally be a large difference in dollar amount between your most costly and least costly RVUs. Instead of determining them by department, alphabetically, or using some other method, it can be a good idea to start with the RVUs that cost the most. Whether they cost more because of the time or resources involved, or because they are used the most frequently, these are often the RVUs that determine the profitability of the practice. For example, if your RVUs are below the national benchmark average, but you have a high patient volume, you may need to take a look at the efficiency of your practice in order to grow. </p>\r\n<h3>5. Get the math right</h3>\r\n<p>Arriving at an accurate RVU is more complicated than simply taking the purchase costs and adding subjective charges to get a number. The base price of a product or service is not merely the cost associated with acquiring the item or performing the service. Other factors that add to the initial cost must be added to determine the true value. The following variables must be taken into account:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Labor costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Building lease costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Equipment costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Office supply costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Malpractice and insurance premium costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Time</li>\r\n\t<li>Necessary clinical skill</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are costs that need to be incorporated into the RVUs to keep a practice profitable. It is also important to adjust for a geographic variance. It is absolutely possible to calculate RVUs manually, and for smaller practices, this can be the least expensive choice. Especially for practices with tenured, experienced team members able to help with determining RVUs, it can be a way to encourage staff involvement and elevate thinking. Larger practices may want to consider investing in software or calculation programs and automating the process as much as possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more practice management best practices</h2>\r\n<p>Cost accounting is just one of many ways to improve the health of your medical practice.
