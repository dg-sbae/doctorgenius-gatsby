However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/what-is-barnacle-seo/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Using the right keywords is important for your business. However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to rank on their own with so much competition. Barnacle SEO is an effective technique in these situations to help such businesses rank for competitive keywords. Here is why this technique is effective and why our team at Doctor Genius prefers to use it.</p>\r\n<h2>An Overview of Barnacle SEO</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008, Search Influence&#8217;s Will Scott coined the term &#8220;barnacle SEO&#8221; to describe the process of smaller businesses attaching their names to larger, more established domains to benefit from their authority. Using established websites that rank for the most popular and competitive keywords can help a small or new business rank higher without doing the same work necessary for traditional SEO.</p>\r\n<p>Barnacle SEO mimics the relationship that takes place in the natural world between barnacles and whales. Barnacles, tiny arthropods no bigger than an inch in diameter, attach themselves to a moving object, like a whale, to gather nutrients from the current. Similar to this relationship, a business can benefit from attaching its name to a search engine whale. The business can go wherever the search engine whale goes, even to the top of the SERPs. The barnacle and whale relationship is a commensal one. The barnacle does not hurt the whale, nor does it help it. However, in order to make the most of the barnacle SEO technique, it is important to act more like a partner to the big websites and less like a parasite.</p>\r\n<h3>Guest Blogging</h3>\r\n<p>Guest blogging is one of the most popular barnacle SEO activities. This particular strategy involves reaching out to websites and pitching a guest blog post. Doing this can seem intimidating for small and new businesses. However, blogs with authority may be willing to work with smaller ones, especially if helping out means adding another article to be ranked on their website. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before reaching out to a website, it is beneficial to research topics that are trending in a particular niche. It is also helpful to consider topics that have not had much coverage but may benefit readers. Identify top blogs and craft an attractive pitch for a guest blog post. If the website is big enough, a guest blog can receive many visitors and shares.</p>\r\n<h3>Types of Websites to Target</h3>\r\n<p>Using barnacle SEO does not always involve asking for a guest blog appearance. Another activity involves targeting websites that people use daily. These websites are online directories and publishing platforms. Some commonly used websites for barnacle SEO are Google My Business, Angie&#8217;s List, Facebook, and TripAdvisor. It is also beneficial to identify websites that specifically cater to one&#8217;s niche. Once the target sites are identified, one can create a profile to list their business and begin using barnacle SEO.</p>\r\n<h3>Leverage Review Sites</h3>\r\n<p>There are several benefits to leveraging review sites. One significant advantage is that it can help with SEO. Review sites like TripAdvisor, Google My Business, Yelp, Angie&#8217;s List, and Foursquare have a lot of search engine authority. Make sure to keep all information up-to-date on each review site. It is also essential to complete a profile and include all the information that potential customers will need, like the business location, hours, and services. </p>\r\n<p>A strong profile with positive customer reviews can help to rank higher for local searches. In addition to boosting online reputation, it is also a great way to get more direct and organic traffic. When creating a profile, it is also necessary to consider the types of terms that typically rank well for review sites. Some examples are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">(Product or service) review</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">(Product or service) alternatives</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Tools like (product or service)</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Writing for Publishing Platforms</h3>\r\n<p>Listing a business on online directories is a popular barnacle SEO strategy, but other options can also yield good results. Writing for any of the many publishing platforms can help expand reach. One of the most popular and effective publishing platforms is Medium. Medium consistently ranks on the first page for competitive key terms in various industries, from business to health. Another benefit of Medium is that its results often include featured snippets.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post\">Publishing on Medium</a> is fairly straightforward. It is acceptable to target an industry&#8217;s most competitive key terms when using barnacle SEO. Here is an overview of the process:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Conduct keyword research</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Select the search intent</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Optimize content so it aligns with the target keyword</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use subheadings and incorporate keywords where possible</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Embed or add creatives, such as images, infographics, and video</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Above all, make sure the writing is of high quality. Medium has domain authority, so write like an authority figure. The content should be easy to read and understand but also informative and factual.

While being professional, a dental office should also encourage a comfortable and relaxing environment for patients. The right design can transform your office and help calm your patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Alleviating Patient Anxiety</h2>\r\n<p>As many as <a href=\"https://www.statisticstats.com/health/dentophobia-statistics-of-dentist-fear-and-anxiety/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statisticstats.com/health/dentophobia-statistics-of-dentist-fear-and-anxiety/\">75% of adults experience fear or anxiety about visiting the dentist</a>. Of those adults, between 5% to 10% have a dental phobia, which is more severe than generalized fear. While the fear of pain is the number one reason for fearing the dentist, a dental office environment can heighten those feelings. Having the right office decor can alleviate tension and anxiety in patients and drastically improve their overall experience.</p>\r\n<h3>Using Decor to Create a Comfortable Atmosphere</h3>\r\n<p>Before decorating an office, think about the way patients feel. Creating a homey atmosphere with decor can calm patients and help them feel at ease. In the past dental offices were characterized by rows of plastic chairs, coffee tables stacked with magazines, and possibly a toy or two for children. Today, this noticeably low-effort decor can send the message of not caring about one&#8217;s patients.</p>\r\n<p>Incorporating elements that one would find in a home can help give patients more positive feelings. Items like a well-stocked mini-fridge, a coffee maker, and comfortable furniture create a more inviting and cheerful atmosphere. As for the artwork, use more unique pieces to make a greater impact. Photos, paintings, and drawings are a great way to inject warmth and personality into the office. Choose pieces that complement the rest of the decor rather than clash with it.</p>\r\n<h3>Adding a Touch of Nature</h3>\r\n<p>Dental offices can easily feel cold, impersonal, and sterile. Adding plants throughout the office can help combat those feelings without buying new furniture or artwork. Flowers and other decorative plants help breathe life into an office and allow patients to feel more at ease. Certain plants like lavender, chrysanthemum, and aloe vera may also have a calming effect on patients. The sight of thriving foliage in a waiting room can make a statement about the level of caring and attention to detail.</p>\r\n<h3>Playing Background Music</h3>\r\n<p>The soothing power of background music is invaluable to dental offices. Studies have shown that slower tempo tunes are great for relaxation and stress management. According to researchers at Stanford University, <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/may31/brainwave-053106.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/may31/brainwave-053106.html\">listening to music has the same effect on brain functioning as anxiety-reducing medications</a>. Offices can play commercial-free, lyric-free background music to help put patients at ease and keep them calm for the duration of their appointments. </p>\r\n<p>Certain types of music are better for stress reduction than others. Celtic, Native American and Indian-stringed instruments are among the top sounds that people respond to favorably. Classical music, light jazz, or other types of easy-listening music are popular choices as well.</p>\r\n<h3>Color Matters</h3>\r\n<p>Although amenities, artwork, and background music are important, color is another significant factor in creating a calm environment for patients. Color is a powerful communication tool that can impact a person’s emotions and physiological reactions. Certain colors are associated with increased metabolism and high blood pressure, while others are associated with calmness and stress release. Using the right colors can help inspire feelings of ease in patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Using the Colors Green, Blue, and Purple</h3>\r\n<p>As the symbolic color of nature, green can evoke calmness and tranquility in patients, making it an ideal color to use as the basis for an office. Some ways to incorporate this color is by painting the walls of patient rooms in a soothing hue of green or adding other green decorations throughout the office. Blue is a popular color in the business world, as research shows that this color can incite feelings of trustworthiness and calmness. Using blue can help patients feel more trusting, which is important for patient retention and helping them feel comfortable. The use of purple can also add a feminine touch to a dental office. Purple combines the calming effects of blue with the energy of red, making it a great accent color for certain types of dental practices.</p>\r\n<h3>Keeping Age in Mind</h3>\r\n<p>It is also important to think about the age group that one&#8217;s practice caters to when decorating an office. Offices that treat adults can use their decor to create an environment where patients can relax. One can also make an office more entertaining for adults by installing televisions to distract patients while waiting or getting a procedure done.</p>\r\n<p>Dental offices that cater to children can incorporate elements to foster a fun and cheerful environment. When designing a dental waiting area for children, one can use bright colors and soft materials with fun toys and games to help keep them entertained and calm while waiting. When serving children, consider adding the following elements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Dedicated play area</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Fun murals and wallpapers</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Healthy snacks and beverages</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Kid-friendly literature</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Kid-sized furniture</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The Modern Patient Experience Begins Online</h2>\r\n<p>Even if an office is calming and comfortable, it is futile if no one sees it.

Reaching your audience,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-connect-to-an-audience-through-social-media/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>It can be difficult to effectively manage your practice&#8217;s social media accounts while taking care of patients. Reaching your audience, building relationships, and creating a good first impression online requires more than just posting an advertisement. Interactive marketing relies on communication and relevancy to make an impact. Here are some tips to boost your online presence and connect with your audience through social media organically.</p>\r\n<h2>Variety and Frequency of Social Media Communication</h2>\r\n<p>Regardless of the social media platforms used, there is a sweet spot for how many times to post. However, there is no hard and fast rule for how often a business should post. It is also essential to create engaging and informative content to get the audience interested in learning more.</p>\r\n<h3>Tailor Each Platform</h3>\r\n<p>It may be appropriate to post on some platforms daily, while others may only require posting a few days a week. Sticking to approximately one post per day is ideal for most social media platforms. This practice is especially true for Facebook and Instagram, where posting one to two times a day is acceptable for most businesses. Posting less than this may cause prospective patients to lose interest, while posting more can overwhelm or even annoy leads. Consistency is key for both platforms.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding Twitter, there is much more flexibility in how frequently to post, as there is often a shorter window for businesses to reach clients just after tweeting. Some businesses can post as many as five times a day with good results. Posting once a day during the workweek on LinkedIn is ideal as business professionals, and older adults primarily use it.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Forms of Engagement</h3>\r\n<p>While there is a limit on how often to post on social media accounts, there is no limit to online engagement with prospective and current clients. If someone interacts with a platform through a comment or question, the business should <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\">try to respond immediately</a>. The sooner the response, the better the chances are of meeting their needs and establishing a relationship.</p>\r\n<p>It can be challenging to keep track of social media communication, so turning on notifications for accounts or assigning an individual to manage the social media page can help one remain consistent. If responding right away is not possible, try to answer at least by the end of the day. Social media interaction with clients is now more important than ever. <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service\">Research</a> has found that 33% of customers prefer to contact companies through social media rather than the phone and that 77% of U.S. online adults say that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide good service.</p>\r\n<h3>Developing a Strategy</h3>\r\n<p>The first step to delivering great content is to design a social media strategy. This plan should identify marketing goals and the target audience. There are many different approaches to social media marketing that a business may take. Still, there are common goals like building brand awareness, growing page likes, generating leads, and increasing website visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Developing Goals</h3>\r\n<p>The first marketing campaign for recently established businesses or ones new to social media should build the target audience&#8217;s awareness. Businesses will often use paid advertisements geared toward a specific demographic to do this. Having a solid understanding of the brand identity and niche can help make this process quicker and more successful. Growing page likes is important as audience engagement is essential to making the most of investments in social media marketing. Encouraging page likes is one way to grow an audience. One way to do this is through doing page-like campaigns to get people to follow a practice on social media.</p>\r\n<p>The primary business goal is to generate sales. In the medical field, this means finding potential patients seeking services and getting them to contact one&#8217;s office. Lead generation is more successful after a business gains a decent level of brand awareness. People are more likely to hear about a practice through social media than to land organically on a page through a search engine. One way to do this is by starting a social media campaign geared towards link clicks. This campaign can increase a website&#8217;s SEO and get more people to visit the website and learn more about the services available.</p>\r\n<h3>Diversifying Types of Content</h3>\r\n<p>Once a social media strategy is in place, the next step is to create content. Creating content that informs and interests people can draw in potential patients. Posts should vary depending on the platforms used instead of relying on the same type of content. Diversifying content through various images, videos, polls, contests, and more can lead to more audience engagement and interest.</p>\r\n<p>Add hashtags to posts and engage the audience by asking questions, sharing pictures of patients (with permission) on social media, and showing engagement in the local community. One can also use the story features on social media to get followers interested in what they do. While a social media marketing strategy can also include advertisements, including content that feels organic helps visitors relate and feel more connected while interacting online.</p>\r\n<h2>Reach More Patients</h2>\r\n<p>Growing your social media presence and connecting with your audience through interactive marketing can help you reach more people.
