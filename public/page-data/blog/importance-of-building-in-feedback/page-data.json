If you are like many business owners, you<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-building-in-feedback/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>To enable comments or not to enable comments, that is the question. If you are like many business owners, you fear that by adding a comment section to your blog or website, you are inadvertently inviting negative feedback. Negative feedback, especially when shared in such a public way, can adversely affect visitors’ perceptions of your practice or brand. Add to this the fact that enabling comments is time-consuming, as commenters often expect responses, and that it requires moderation to deter junk commenters, you may feel that the answer is obvious: Keep the comments off. However, at Doctor Genius, we encourage you to do the opposite.</p>\r\n<h2>Reasons to incorporate a comment section into your site design</h2>\r\n<p>The marketing world has long been in debate over the whys and why-nots of a comments section on a blog. You can check out the for- and against- arguments on <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/\">Optinmonster</a>, but we want to share our thoughts with you below.</p>\r\n<h3>Build a network</h3>\r\n<p>Content marketing serves three major purposes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>To help your site gain rankings</li>\r\n\t<li>To establish your practice as an authoritative presence</li>\r\n\t<li>To build relationships with current and potential patients</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Allowing feedback enables you to do the third by giving you a way to connect with your followers, to develop relationships based on mutual interests and respect, and to turn an otherwise static piece of content in a living conversation. In short, it allows you to build a network.</p>\r\n<h3>Encourage constructive criticism</h3>\r\n<p>You create content for your audience members, so allow them to make suggestions. Turn the comments section on to encourage feedback regarding an article’s content and to invite ideas for improvement and future topics. This type of constructive criticism gives you a tangible sense of how your audience responds to your content, as well as ways you can improve it so that it resonates positively with the intended recipients.</p>\r\n<h3>Contribute to your SEO</h3>\r\n<p>Many website owners who turn off the comments section fail to take into consideration the SEO value it offers. While a handful of comments is unlikely to make a difference for any given page’s rankings, dozens to hundreds of comments can. How? The reason is two-fold.</p>\r\n<p>First, comments contribute to page length. Second, more words on a page gives it an opportunity to rank for more keywords. To determine whether this contributed to increased search traffic, <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/\">Neil Patel</a> conducted an in-depth study. He found two things to be true.</p>\r\n<p>The first was that, on a comments section that added nearly 4,000 words to a page, approximately 26% of keywords that ranked in Google came from the comments section. The second was that the section garnered approximately 16% of the article’s traffic. Though incorporating feedback into your site design may make more work for you, the results can be well worth it.</p>\r\n<h2>The smart way to enable comments</h2>\r\n<p>A section that encourages feedback can help in multiple other ways, such as keeping your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/\">site live</a>, encouraging customer loyalty, and serving as social proof. Of course, there are the drawbacks to consider, but those become a moot point when you have a dedicated account manager moderating comments, responding to feedback, and, of course, dealing with the back-end issues.

Attracting people with eye-catching and informative blogs can help drive potential clients to view the site and eventually to set appointments.</p>\r\n<p>One element that you may hesitate to include on your site is a place for people to provide feedback. However, failing to do so may cause you to miss opportunities to get ranked higher in search results and make improvements to the practice. Discover how asking for feedback can take management at your practice to the next level.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of an open comment section</h2>\r\n<p>Reviews and opinions have become essential resources people consider when viewing a new practice or product. If a company does not ask for feedback, prospective clients may look elsewhere. When devising a site design, the placement of feedback can vary. A link at the footer of each page is one option. Popup feedback prompts at various spots on the site is another way to collect this data. Gathering feedback demonstrates that your practice welcomes opinions, and it gives you the chance to improve the business.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to utilize feedback for the better</h2>\r\n<p>The more you interact with people on your site, the higher the page may rank in search results. This is in part due to the way search engines calculate the trustworthiness of a website. When engines like Google find a site trustworthy, it bumps it up higher in the ranks.

Engaging with those who submit feedback demonstrates management&#8217;s willingness to address issues and make changes. Some simple actions may help improve your business tremendously.</p>\r\n<h3>Reexamine current processes</h3>\r\n<p>When a client provides a negative review or expresses discontent, take a look at the current processes. When you actively work to change things after receiving negative feedback, you increase the chances of attracting new patients. For instance, improving the check-in procedure after getting complaints about it can help the flow of traffic in the office. It may also cut down on unnecessary work for employees.</p>\r\n<h3>Take visible action</h3>\r\n<p>As a manager, it is important to think carefully about what you need to do to rectify a negative experience, especially if it involves addressing an employee&#8217;s actions or behavior. As <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/29/8-ways-negative-feedback-can-lead-to-greater-success-at-work/#5f20f2d32c69\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/29/8-ways-negative-feedback-can-lead-to-greater-success-at-work/#5f20f2d32c69\">Forbes.com</a> points out, the more you focus on the opportunity for improvement, the better workers will handle negative feedback. Aside from taking action within the practice, you must respond to the original post. When potential clients can see that you made a timely response, it increases your authority and legitimacy. Because medical practices rely heavily on word of mouth for new patients, the faster you respond to feedback, the greater the chance people will take note.</p>\r\n<h2>Get help with your site</h2>\r\n<p>Maintaining a successful practice takes a great deal of work.

One strategy that many have not heard of focuses on semantic similarity and semantic distance to promote content based on the words themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Natural language processing</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b\">Natural language processing</a> is a tool that search engines use to help find content that matches a specific search. An AI identifies certain words in a section of text that it deems particularly important — more important than the rest of the text. These words are often nouns or pronouns, like names, businesses, numbers, and locations, and the AI picks them out to determine how a webpage should rank with related search terms. A good content writer can take these words and integrate them as relevant SEO keywords, producing a higher rank overall for a website.</p>\r\n<h3>Scoring term frequency</h3>\r\n<p>In every document, those specific words, called entities, can be matched with certain search words. However, not all-important terms in a document identically match someone’s search. The AI&#8217;s score is based on how often a word or term appears in the text. The more it appears, the higher it is ranked in terms of importance. However, if the same word or phrase appears across many texts online, its ranking may get lowered because its popularity indicates it is simply a general term (and is therefore not as important). Balancing these two factors is key in getting the most out of your document terms.</p>\r\n<h3>Scoring semantic similarity</h3>\r\n<p>&#8220;Semantic&#8221; refers to the meaning of words. When ranking similarities between words, natural language processing considers how two words may fall in the same category when compared to words that do not relate to them at all. This process can be helpful for finding websites that are relevant but may not contain the exact words in a user&#8217;s search.</p>\r\n<h3>Reducing semantic distance</h3>\r\n<p>Semantic distance is how far apart two words appear in natural language processing. By using words that relate to each other and so fall into the same categories, a writer can produce content that is more likely to be picked up by search engines looking for similar words. That said, beyond simply identifying content topics, with semantic similarity there is a greater chance of sites being organized and ranked based on content. This can make the rankings more convoluted, which is why including words that are similar to search terms can rank your site higher in regard to both organization and topic.</p>\r\n<h2>Find more ways to reduce semantic distance in your content</h2>\r\n<p>Reducing semantic distance can be a challenge when you do not fully understand how words and terms play into search engine rankings.
