Washing your<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/positively-impact-your-practice-with-these-simple-steps/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The COVID-19 global pandemic will impact your business even if you do not buy into the media frenzy. Washing your hands might help you keep the virus away, but it will not bring more customers to your business.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping your business moving forward during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>This article will go over tactics you can use to keep your business above water as you navigate around the uncertainty created by the coronavirus. Here are simple ways to positively impact your business and customers.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Use automated lead processes</h3>\r\n<p>Business owners should already have automated lead generation systems in place. If your business does not already have one, now is a good time to start. Such systems can easily help you double your sales and bring in extra revenue that might help keep the doors of your business open.</p>\r\n<p>Businesses without automated ways to generate leads are essentially running up a hill. They often end up spending more money to generate fewer leads. Automating the process allows business owners to sell their products and services even when the business is closed.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Streamline systems and use fewer workers</h3>\r\n<p>It is typically easier to manage a system than it is to manage individuals. People tend to become more unreliable during stressful times, and having a system in place makes it easier to determine which employees are contributing the most. It also allows them to work more efficiently.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Provide safeguards for customers</h3>\r\n<p>With so much uncertainty going around, providing safeguards for customers will make them more likely to purchase your business&#8217;s products and services. Let customers know how your business is adapting to the coronavirus and what will happen if you are not able to fulfill your end of the contract due to the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Understanding how potential customers have been affected by the coronavirus can also help increase your sales. For example, providing payment plans can be helpful when dealing with customers whose income has been limited by COVID-19. Surveys are a great way to get into the minds of potential customers and understand their concerns. The business can then implement safeguards that address these concerns.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Use high-quality copy</h3>\r\n<p>People being quarantined due to the coronavirus means that they are spending more time online. Having a website or web marketing system gives business owners a huge competitive advantage right now.</p>\r\n<p>Marketing tactics like search engine optimization will bring traffic to a business, but that is only half the battle. Engaging copy on your website is what builds trust with the person and prompts them to make a purchase. It involves placing relevant content at the top of the page.</p>\r\n<p>Focusing on the quantity of content on a website over quality rarely ever works out for the business. People will not trust your business if you have poorly written content on your site, and you will not generate much revenue with weak sales pitches.</p>\r\n<h2>Take advantage of new opportunities</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 brings its share of challenges, but it also brings many opportunities that smart business owners can take advantage of for their benefit.

The global pandemic continues to claim more lives as each day passes, and it has disrupted manufacturing and businesses in ways we have never seen before. Many businesses have been slowed down to a halt, while others have to reduce their hours of operation.</p>\r\n<p>Without a doubt, this pandemic will bring significant changes to our lives, as it proves how unprepared the world is for such events. COVID-19 brings the apocalypse for many businesses, but others will be able to use the disruption to their advantage.</p>\r\n<h2>Marketing in a world with COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Figuring out the right ways to market a business might seem like rocket science. Still, the fundamentals of digital marketing can help your business make it through the current economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Here are simple things you can do to ensure that people can find your business online:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Social media marketing</h3>\r\n<p>Social media is where billions of people all over the globe connect on online platforms. Social media marketing might seem intimidating if it is not something you use personally, but many of these platforms are easy to figure out. If you are one of those people who have a hard time navigating the internet, take online classes to familiarize yourself with the social media platform you plan to use or hire a social media manager.</p>\r\n<p>Think of social media as a place you can share your thoughts, products, and services. Consistently post information that provides value, and your following will grow. A huge following allows you to send information about your business to a large number of people in a matter of seconds. You can also use direct messages to market products and services or network with other business owners who might have helpful information.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Create videos</h3>\r\n<p>Video marketing is another great way to market your business. Business owners can do this by making video tutorials targeting keywords relevant to their business. For example, a dentist who runs their practice can create step-by-step tutorials on the proper way to floss. People looking to improve their flossing technique enter keywords into a search engine. The tutorial created by the dentist pops up, and the patient gets the information they need from a credible source. YouTube is a great place to start with marketing videos.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Create a blog with a focus on search engine optimization</h3>\r\n<p>A web-blog also helps you reach a wider audience. Many business owners are hesitant to start one because they feel that the many other pages online will drown theirs out, but that only happens when you do not include search engine optimization as part of your marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<p>A good SEO strategy allows you to drive organic traffic to your blog. There are no limits to how much traffic a business can bring in using SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>The fundamentals will get you past COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Stick to the fundaments of digital marketing, and your business will be more likely to survive the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Call or email Doctor Genius to learn more about how we can help you to keep your business running while the world deals with COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p><em>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

You understand the importance of social<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-do-i-reschedule-all-my-appointments/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>You know that you should postpone elective and preventive care during the COVID-19 crisis. You understand the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve. Still, you worry about finances. You need a full schedule to generate revenue, so rescheduling your appointments is critical. Here are a few rescheduling tips to help your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Tips for rescheduling appointments during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Communication is key to filling waiting rooms once the crisis is over. Health care providers know that shelter-in-place orders could continue for months. Some even expect it could last until 2021 when a possible vaccine may finally be ready. Providers should connect with patients, so they understand what to expect during this time.</p>\r\n<p>Also, this call will help ensure patients return for the rescheduled appointment. The provider can answer any questions patients may have.</p>\r\n<h3>Prioritize based on the needs of the patients</h3>\r\n<p>Health care providers should prioritize patients when rescheduling appointments. Patients who are at the highest risk should get priority when rescheduling. Providers should stay in frequent contact with these patients, providing updates on when it will be possible to see them again. Maintaining contact shows the patients that their health is a priority for the practice. This provides an incentive to reschedule.</p>\r\n<h3>Make rescheduling easy</h3>\r\n<p>Even before COVID-19, most patients prefer scheduling appointments online. Practices can expect to see a spike in rescheduled appointments with online scheduling. The fear of the unknown makes it difficult for patients to know when it is okay to go to a provider. By providing online scheduling, patients can fill those slots when they feel comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>This also lessens the burden on the staff. Staff members are already bogged down with phone calls. Allowing patients to reschedule online allows members to talk to those who need it most. This takes the stress off the staff members’ shoulders. It also makes it easier to keep a full schedule. Patients, employees, and business owners win with this strategy.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider telehealth</h3>\r\n<p>Telehealth and teledentistry have come into vogue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology allows providers to manage basic conditions and offer preventative care. These appointments tend to take less time for both the patient and the provider and are more affordable. They can also take place over the computer or phone. This form of appointment limits in-person visits.</p>\r\n<p>If possible, providers should rely on telehealth to manage some of the burdens. Filling the schedule with telehealth appointments makes it easier to meet the demands of the patients. Providers who use this can begin seeing patients now. These providers do not have to wait until the crisis is over. Also, providers can maintain appointments with telehealth even after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep the books full during and after the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>It is normal to feel worried about the state of your practice during a pandemic. Canceled appointments hurt your bottom line. You need to reschedule those missed opportunities. Fortunately, you can fill your schedule. Communicate with your patients, give priority to those who are at the highest risk, and make it easy for people to reschedule. Also, you can rely on telehealth so you can catch up on rescheduled appointments quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Practices across the country have reduced the hours or shut their doors completely, leaving providers wondering what to do when the pandemic is over. What steps need to be taken to jump back in and see patients again? While it might seem impossible to hit the ground running, you can do just that with a little preparation.</p>\r\n<h2>Steps to keep schedules full after the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>It could take months or even a year before life is back to normal. When that happens, patients will be ready to go to local practices. Practices that take the steps necessary to get up and to run quickly will enjoy an influx of patients. Many will even have stronger practices than ever before.</p>\r\n<h3>Get financial help</h3>\r\n<p>While some practices are closed, others are still open but offer fewer services. In both cases, practices have fewer financial resources available. It is hard to get up and running without any capital, so practices are encouraged to use the available financial resources to put cash into the business. The federal government is currently offering a Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, including medical and dental practices, keep employees on the payroll. Keeping employees on the payroll will make it easier to run on all cylinders when the pandemic is over.</p>\r\n<p>The federal government is offering other financial options for practices that have taken a financial hit during the COVID-19 pandemic. These options include loan advances, bridge loans, and debt relief. Practices can use these resources to stay financially healthy during the pandemic. Then, when the pandemic is under control, practices will be ready to get back to work.</p>\r\n<h3>Expand hours when reopening</h3>\r\n<p>There will be a massive demand for health care providers and dentists when Americans are no longer required to engage in social distancing. Practices are encouraged to expand their hours to meet the demand. Those who do this are more likely to get a larger portion of the patients. If possible, practices should also consider working on weekends until the demand begins to die down. This can help practices generate revenue in the first several months after the pandemic ends.</p>\r\n<h3>Broadcast sterilization techniques</h3>\r\n<p>The aftermath of the pandemic will likely include psychological changes. Americans will be more fearful of germs and viruses. Practices that want to attract patients will need to make sterilization strategies part of their business models. Simply cleaning more often is not enough. Practices need to communicate what they are doing to the patients. Those who go the extra mile are more likely to generate business.</p>\r\n<h2>Get ready to restart your practice</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has changed the way you do business. It might seem like there is no end in sight, but eventually, the pandemic will be contained, and you will go back to business as normal. For that to happen, however, you need to take steps to prepare. Get the financial help you need during the pandemic. Then, consider expanding your hours and adopt sterilization techniques so your patients will not worry about getting sick. Then, you can treat patients like you did before COVID-19 took over.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

While this concept works in all areas of business and<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-implement-kaizen-strategies-to-inspire-teams/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Kaizen is a Japanese concept that refers to continuous improvement. While this concept works in all areas of business and personal growth, many medical and dental practices have particularly enjoyed success using Kaizen. The key is to implement strategies that inspire teams. When everyone is inspired and involved, those small improvements add up and create a healthy practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Kaizen strategies to inspire teams</h2>\r\n<p>Employees should be at the heart of a practice’s Kaizen strategy. This goes beyond the top of the chain employees. Everyone, including janitors and support staff, is needed for this strategy to work. Once everyone is involved, employees will feel inspired. To ensure inspiration, employers must train employees, empower them, and measure the results.</p>\r\n<h3>Train employees on Kaizen</h3>\r\n<p>Before a practice can implement Kaizen strategies, it must ensure that employees fully understand it. All employees must receive training on Kaizen. The strategies are simple and include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Improvements with small, incremental changes</li>\r\n\t<li>The ideas come from the employees</li>\r\n\t<li>Feedback for all changes</li>\r\n\t<li>The results are measurable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Practices should train all current employees. Also, new employees should be trained on Kaizen when hired. Once everyone is on the same page, it is time to implement the strategies. Then, the practice can make small improvements and inspire employees.</p>\r\n<h3>Empower employees and teams</h3>\r\n<p>To truly inspire, practices must empower employees. All employees should be encouraged to share ideas to improve their positions. Employees give suggestions to supervisors, who then empower them to implement the change immediately. This gives employees the freedom to make meaningful changes in the workplace.</p>\r\n<p>Practices should also encourage teams to work together to brainstorm ideas for changes. When working in teams, it is common to have several solutions. The team should select one of the ideas and start with it. Then, if that idea does not provide the desired results, the team can try a different idea.</p>\r\n<h3>Measure the results</h3>\r\n<p>Kaizen works because it is measurable. Supervisors must measure the outcome after the changes are implemented. After the results are tracked, the employee meets with the supervisor to go over the results. If both agree that the results showed a positive outcome, the new practice can be standardized and enforced. It will continue to be the standard mode of practice until someone else comes up with a new way to improve the results.</p>\r\n<p>Employees cannot help but feel inspired after their ideas become standard practice. These employees are making a difference on the practice. That causes employees to work hard to come up with additional ideas as well. It is exciting to have a role in changing a practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Grow your practice with Kaizen</h2>\r\n<p>Significant changes are challenging to implement and often do not provide the results you need for your practice. With Kaizen, you can use small changes to transform your practice. You might not notice huge changes overnight, but after using Kaizen for a few months, you will start to see significant results. Possibly, more importantly, your employees will be inspired and take ownership of their positions. Use these tips to implement strategies that get your employees excited to contribute at work.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most. Digital marketing can help your practice adapt and grow in the aftermath of COVID-19.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Are Here to Help </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unsure if your dental practice is ready for the digital landscape, we can help.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
