In 2015, Google found that 51 percent of smartphone users discovered a new company or product when conducting a search on a smartphone. Similar to how commercials on TV are still relevant to promoting products, having an easily accessible website that works on mobile devices is crucial for any successful practice.\r\n\r\n<h3>Easy access</h3>\r\n\r\nWith the invention of smartphones, society began to rely on these devices for more than a few apps and phone calls. Google also found that in 2015, more Google searches took place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan. A professional practice will greatly benefit from a website that is mobile-first.\r\n\r\nMany people may browse potential dentists or doctors in their local area by searching on their smartphone while watching TV at home. Regardless, mobile searches are a crucial aspect of how potential patients determine which practice they will choose. A website that takes too long to load or is too complex to use will only motivate the patient to search other practices. Also, Google will not rank a website that takes too long to load. Thus, it is crucial to have a mobile first website.\r\n\r\nA mobile first website means that when people search the website on their smartphone or tablet devices with a smaller screen than a computer, the website is responsive or will load proportionately to the screen. At Doctor Genius, our clients can rest easy knowing that we pride ourselves on building mobile first websites to help bring in potential patients.\r\n\r\n<h3>All the necessary information on the go</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-685\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Google also found that in 2015, more Google searches took place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhile cell phones of the past were a technological revolution for providing call services from virtually anywhere without a cord, smartphones are famous for being able to access thousands of search results anytime anywhere. With today’s smartphone, people can have equal or more computing power to a desktop computer.\r\n\r\nProfessionals need to ensure that their website has all of the necessary information readily available and easy to access on any device. If a potential patient looks at a client’s website on a smartphone and finds that the page does not work or load properly, they will probably dismiss it.\r\n\r\nThus, Doctor Genius will set up a mobile first website that works on multiple devices and stands out in the digital market. With our tools and techniques, you can enhance your website and increase the efficiency with which you bring in new patients.

In June of 2017, Facebook reached 2 billion monthly users. Medical professionals who do not utilize social media are missing out on the chance to reach a greater number of patients in the digital landscape. However, professional social media accounts require constant management.\r\n\r\n<h3>The key to effective social media marketing</h3>\r\n\r\nWhile adults will seek out information about dentistry or other medical practice, it is no surprise that younger audiences will not. It is important to know how to use social media to reach your target audience. Having multiple accounts on social media platforms is crucial for medical professionals to reach people of various demographics and backgrounds.\r\n\r\nAfter all, HubSpot found that in 2017, 74 percent of people say they use Facebook for professional reasons. Keeping up multiple social media accounts from Facebook to Yelp, can become difficult with a busy schedule.\r\n\r\nHowever, the key to effective social media marketing is efficient social media management. For instance, a post about proper brushing techniques can contain hyperlinks that take the individual back to your website with more information.\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col m7\">\r\n<blockquote>Facebook, by far, sends a greater volume of readers to both short-form and long-form news. Overall, about eight-in ten user complete interactions with a news article via a social networking site come from Facebook (82% long-form and 84% short-form), while a much smaller portion come from Twitter (16% long-form and 14% short-form). –Pew Research Center, 2016</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col m5\"><img class=\"wp-image-673\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2.jpg 378w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2-300x294.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2-177x174.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>\r\n</div>\r\nYou can have your target demographic reading more content on your website through the proper social media posts. At Doctor Genius, we know how to help reach out to the target audience that will respond best to your content.\r\n\r\n<h3>Keeping up constant posts</h3>\r\n\r\nSocial media accounts that do not keep up consistent posts will find fewer followers and views on their profiles. If you do not have someone to keep an active account, then it is less likely to drive traffic. Thus, having a company that specializes in social media management and marketing to help keep the updates going is a great benefit for your practice.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we will help clients by updating multiple accounts with active content to help them to reach more potential patients. With our services, we can help direct patients from social media to the active content on your website on top of multiple service pages. We will help customize the website to your requests while also ensuring effective content.\r\n\r\nBy seeking the services at Doctor Genius, you can focus on your practice and we can take care of your digital presence online.

When it comes to investing in a medical service or purchasing a product, potential customers may actually avoid websites with too much information or text. Information overload can lead to people seeking services elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<h3>Avoiding too much information</h3>\r\n\r\nIn a study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS, titled “On Making the Right Choice: The Deliberation-Without-Attention Effect,” participants chose between four cars. With one car being better than the rest, the first group of participants was given four facts about each car while a second group was given 12 facts about each car.\r\n\r\nThe results show that the group that had less information chose the better car 60 percent of the time. The group that was given 12 facts about the cars only chose the best care 20 percent of the time. This study is only one example of how too much information can dissuade a potential buyer and the same applies to potential patients for a medical practice.\r\n\r\nWith the advancements of the digital market, a variety of businesses continues to rush to create a website representing their brand, services, products and company information. Medical practices also greatly benefit from having websites. However, overloading a website with too much content will actually have a negative instead of a positive effect on the website’s conversion rate.\r\n\r\n<h3>Quality content for the audience</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-668\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> Thus, professional practice websites need to balance quality with comprehension.<p></div>\r\n\r\nWhile a website does need the right amount of content to describe services and rank online, clogging up pages with too much content or too many complex terms can make it difficult for potential patients to navigate. It is important to remember that the people looking at a medical practice’s website will be people outside of the medical field. Thus, professional practice websites need to balance quality with comprehension.\r\n\r\nIn an article online, Google states that ranking based on numbers and factors that include the freshness, diversity, rich textual and originality of content. Another factor to consider is that keywords can rank higher in search results without requiring a large amount of dense content. This is why it is crucial to have a company who understands the ins and outs of online marketing and content creation.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we can help you reach more potential patients with custom content. We strategically create content that matches your needs while also helping the website rank on search results to bring in more patients. Making a website more complex and dense will lower the conversion for potential patients.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in creating a website for your practice and branching out into the digital market, give us a call today.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
