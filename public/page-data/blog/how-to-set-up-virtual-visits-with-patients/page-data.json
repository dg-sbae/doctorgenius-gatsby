If you<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-set-up-virtual-visits-with-patients/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Setting up virtual visits can be the solution you need to continue seeing patients during the COVID-19 crisis. If you are using telemedicine for the first time, you likely have a few questions. Find out how Doctor Genius can help you set up virtual visits by contacting us at (877) 477-2311.</p>\r\n<p>To help you understand the importance of telemedicine, we will go through the steps for getting started. Below are a few tips on scheduling virtual appointments while we get through this pandemic together.</p>\r\n<h2>Using telemedicine during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Right now, the federal government has relaxed rules regarding HIPAA compliance and telemedicine. Still, providers are encouraged to choose a HIPAA-compliant vendor. First, providers can check with their current EHR vendor to see if it has telemedicine functionality.</p>\r\n<p>For our clients, we now offer a TeleDentistry service. If you work in the dental space, contact our office to discuss setting up this service for your practice. Doctor Genius&#8217; option works as an extension to your site&#8217;s interface, allowing patients to connect directly from your website to you.  </p>\r\n<h3>Get the proper technology</h3>\r\n<p>Once practices select software, it is time to consider equipment. Providers need a high-quality webcam and microphone to offer the service. Most computers have both, but many providers choose to purchase standalone equipment. The right equipment improves the quality of video appointments.</p>\r\n<p>Providers also need a fast internet connection. At a minimum, 5 Mbps upload and 15 Mbps download speeds are required. Providers should check the internet speed by running a speed test. It is easy to conduct a speed test online. Those who use Wi-Fi can speed up the connection by plugging the internet directly into the computer through an ethernet cable.</p>\r\n<h3>Choose a dedicated space</h3>\r\n<p>Patients want virtual visits to mimic in-person visits. That means they expect to have the provider’s full attention during telemedicine appointments. Providers should set up a dedicated space for these visits. After selecting a space for the appointments, providers should check the lighting, ensuring that it is bright but does not cause any glare. It is also wise to check for echoes and noise when selecting a room for these visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Test the equipment</h3>\r\n<p>Providers should not conduct telemedicine visits until they test the equipment. Testing is as simple as having a video chat with another provider. The provider can check the sound and video quality, paying special attention to latency. If the video takes time to buffer, it will be difficult to conduct a telemedicine appointment.</p>\r\n<h3>Inform the patient of technical needs</h3>\r\n<p>Many patients have yet to undergo a telemedicine appointment. Providers should explain what is necessary for these appointments, including access to video chat. Ask the patients to sit in a quiet, private room during the appointment. Some will prefer scheduling appointments when no one else is home, so providers should mention that.</p>\r\n<h3>Contact the patient</h3>\r\n<p>After scheduling a telemedicine appointment, the provider needs to contact the patient with a link. This can be done through an online portal or via text message if the patient has opted in to receive SMS messages. The patient is directed to a virtual waiting room after clicking on the link. Then, when the provider is ready, the appointment begins.</p>\r\n<h2>Get started with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Telemedicine makes it much easier for providers to see patients during this health crisis. If you have yet to use this, consider adding telemedicine software. By providing your patients with this option, you can continue to see your patients during this difficult time. This will allow you to limit your in-person visits while still caring for your patients.</p>\r\n<p>With quarantine continuing to be in effect throughout the country, telemedicine and other techniques like it are becoming the solution that medical practices need to continue providing professional care.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As the pandemic rages on, dentists are on the frontlines. If<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/dental-teams-front-line-commitments/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>COVID-19 is affecting all health care providers, including dentists. As the pandemic rages on, dentists are on the frontlines. If you are a dentist, you are likely to continue conducting emergency procedures at your office. Also, you might find yourself helping at the local hospital. Find out more about the frontline commitments dental teams are facing.</p>\r\n<h2>Dental emergencies and COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Every 14 seconds, <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/Science%20and%20Research/HPI/Files/HPIgraphic_0819_1.pdf?la=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">someone visits a hospital or emergency room for a dental condition</a>, according to the American Dental Association. Dentists and physicians urge patients to go to dental offices instead. Going to dental offices takes the burden off hospitals. Also, dental patients will lower the risk of exposure by avoiding emergency rooms.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, the question then becomes how to know if a dentist is open during quarantine? The American Dental Association has created guidelines for dental emergencies. Patients should reach out to a dental office immediately if they experience one of these emergencies.</p>\r\n<h3>Bleeding or swelling</h3>\r\n<p>Bleeding or swelling in or around the mouth is a dental emergency. Gum infection, trauma, malnutrition, or pregnancy could cause mouth bleeding or swelling. After treating the problem, the patient should feel more comfortable. Also, fast treatment prevents infection from spreading. An infection can be dangerous, so patients should visit the dentist immediately. Failure to do so could lead to a more serious medical issue.</p>\r\n<h3>Tooth or jaw pain</h3>\r\n<p>Pain is a sign that something is wrong with the teeth or jaws. Pain could be caused by a cavity or infection, among other things. Unfortunately, untreated pain often continues to get worse. Patients who have pain should seek treatment quickly before it becomes unmanageable. The dentist can alleviate the pain and treat the condition.</p>\r\n<p>Investing in store-bought medication to relieve pain will only provide temporary relief. A dentist can help patients receive the lasting relief they need.</p>\r\n<h3>Broken or knocked-out teeth</h3>\r\n<p>Patients who have broken or knocked-out teeth need immediate care, even during the COVID-19 crisis. The dentist might be able to save the teeth. If not, the dentist can restore the teeth if needed. Failure to seek treatment will allow the teeth to shift. This could lead to bone loss and other oral problems.</p>\r\n<h3>Post-op care</h3>\r\n<p>Those who underwent dental surgery might want to put off post-operative care. Stitch removal and dressing changes are critical. Dentists still want patients to come in for these services. Offices are taking special precautions during the pandemic. These precautions limit the spread of the virus.</p>\r\n<h3>Dentists in hospitals</h3>\r\n<p>Dentists are also working on the frontlines in hospitals. Some dentists help other frontline workers by donating PPE equipment to fight COVID-19. Others are volunteering at local hospitals. For example, California is asking dentists to volunteer. More dentists will likely be needed in hospitals as the pandemic gets closer to the peak in the following months.</p>\r\n<h2>Providing valuable services during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created an all-hands-on-deck situation. Dentists have answered the call by providing emergency services and helping at hospitals. This crisis has brought dental and medical communities together. Both have the desire to reduce patient exposure and help those that are sick. With dentists joining the fight, hospitals are less overwhelmed and can provide the necessary care during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

With<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/what-you-need-to-know-qualifying-for-sba-disaster-loans/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><strong>Amidst the trying and hectic times, SBA disaster loans can help businesses find a <br/>solution to stay above water.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the nation-wide quarantine in effect, many small businesses are wondering how they can protect their employees, business, and themselves. The Small Business Association has several options and recommendations on how to proceed. This blog will cover what you need to know about what the SBA loan is and how the process works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on this topic or to apply for an SBA loan, visit <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance\" target=\"blank\">sba.gov</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Current SItuation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times reports on March 29, 2020, President Trump stated that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html\" target=\"_blank\">social distancing guidelines from the federal government would last until April 30.</a> While the quarantine on what businesses can or cannot open is a decision of the state’s government, small businesses need a more lucrative solution than waiting around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the number of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed cases in the US reaching 163, 539 as of March 31, 2020, </a> and expected to continue climbing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, it is crucial for businesses to develop a plan. Business owners may not even realize that they do not need to experience a disaster to qualify for an SBA disaster loan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Understanding What an SBA Disaster Loan Is</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The SBA explains on their website that, “The SBA offers disaster assistance in the form of low-interest loans to businesses, renters, and homeowners located in regions affected by declared disasters.&#8221; A major concern for small and large businesses across the country involves being able to pay bills along with employees’ payroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By filing for a <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/EIDL_Information_and_Documentation_-_3-23-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SBA disaster loan</a>, you can use it to:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Pay fixed debt payments</li>\r\n<li>Cover payroll</li>\r\n<li>Cover accounts payable</li>\r\n<li>Pay bills</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are certain stipulations and requirements a company needs to meet for an SBA disaster loan, the loan can cover a max of $2 million for economic injury. This way, businesses can support their employees and their company’s infrastructure during this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Qualifying for a Loan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to qualifying for an SBA disaster loan, SBA.gov states that any business with less than 500 employees in the United States that cannot pay bills due to COVID-19. With most companies and industries on hold, much of the economy’s flow is stopped. This ripple effect is causing a variety of issues for various businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases, the interest rate for a small business will be 3.75% and 2.75% for small businesses. The eligibility for the exact amount of this loan will depend on the size and type of resources. The SBA will also take any financial resources the business has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Applying for The Loan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is possible to fill out a paper form and apply in person, it is faster and recommended by the SBA to apply online at their website. After applying for the loan, you can print it out to keep a copy for yourself. In most cases, it can take anywhere from two to three weeks with a disbursement of $225,000 available within five days of approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need immediate assistance or funds, you can request an emergency advance within three days of receiving the application to the amount of $10,000. The sooner people act and apply for this loan, the more likely they will be able to have the necessary funds for themselves, their business, and their employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Included Loan Forgiveness</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another factor to consider when applying for a loan is the possibility of loan forgiveness. With an SBA disaster loan, there is partial loan forgiveness. Loan forgiveness may be possible with issues involving payroll costs, interest payments on a mortgage, along with rent payments for a lease that was in effect prior to February 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there are limits to the amount of forgiveness for the loan. During the application process, you can request assistance from SBA. Our team can also help provide guidance when necessary.  The SBA also will go into detail about the loan and the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Professional Guidance from Our Team</h3>\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, our team works with finance and lending experts who can help you understand this process. Our team can provide guidance and how to proceed for your practice’s best interests.
