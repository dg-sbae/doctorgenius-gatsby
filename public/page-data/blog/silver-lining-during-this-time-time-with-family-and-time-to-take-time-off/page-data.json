This goes beyond the fear of getting sick. Schools and businesses have temporarily shut their doors, and shelter-in-place orders are in effect in most states. Life seemed to change overnight, and it is hard to process. There is a silver lining in this, though. You can take the time to spend with your family.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of family time during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>American families spend an average of 37 minutes of quality time with each other a day, according to a study by Visit Anaheim. Long hours at work, school schedules, and catching up on chores are the main reasons that families cannot spend more time together. Now, however, families are spending hours together each day, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of togetherness. Lear the biggest benefits of spending time together during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<h3>Boost academic performance</h3>\r\n<p>Children who spend ample quality time with parents tend to perform better in school. During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents have become teachers. Parents work alongside their children, helping them complete schoolwork. Many mothers and fathers also use this time to play educational games and impart wisdom to the kids.</p>\r\n<p>When children go back to school after the pandemic, many will be in a better place academically.</p>\r\n<h3>Improve communication skills</h3>\r\n<p>When parents spend most of the time at work or doing chores, it is impossible to model ideal behavior to the kids. Now, with parents at home, they can help children learn communication skills. Acting as models, parents show children the proper way to communicate and behave. Many parents are using the coronavirus pandemic to help children grow into well-adjusted adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Create positive memories</h3>\r\n<p>Positive memories have a lasting impact on people’s well-being. People reach for positive memories during stressful times. These memories remind them that navigating obstacles is possible. Researchers have discovered that children who form positive memories with parents are more tolerant and have better cognitive skills. This also helps with mental health and well-being. As a bonus, those memories are there long after the parents are gone.</p>\r\n<h3>Build stronger mentoring skills</h3>\r\n<p>Adults who spend quality time with family members build stronger mentoring skills. These adults fine-tune these skills while promoting good behavior during family time, and the skills carry over into the workplace. Business owners and employees benefit from developing mentoring skills. After developing the skills, employees and employers can perform better at work. These skills also help people improve the performance of others as well.</p>\r\n<h2>Getting the most out of family time</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 crisis is an uncertain time but use it as a way to bond with your family. Talk frankly about the pandemic with kids and spouse, but do not dwell on the negative. Remember that this is a great time to bond with the people you love the most. Embrace this newfound family time while it is here. Before long, life will return to normal, and you will look back at this time and appreciate the memories you created.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

After all, you have so<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>During the COVID-19 crisis, you might feel an urge to abandon your social media pages. After all, you have so many other things to focus on, including patient care. Your social media channel is actually an important part of patient care during this pandemic. As a trusted provider, your patients and other members of the community count on your social media channel now more than ever. Find out how you can use social media marketing for good during the pandemic.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep people informed during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Medical and dental practices always want patients to be healthy. This is even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Misinformation runs rampant online, and providers can cut through the noise to ensure patients know the facts. This is easy to do when using social media.</p>\r\n<h3>Advocate for social distancing</h3>\r\n<p>Many people do not understand the importance of social distancing or even what the phrase “flatten the curve” means. However, many listen to community health care providers. Providers can use social media channels, including Facebook and Twitter, to educate patients. Healthcare providers have influence over the people who follow them. Using that influence during a pandemic is critical for the common good and health of Americans.</p>\r\n<h3>Help people who need to get tested</h3>\r\n<p>With flu and allergy season colliding with the coronavirus, there is a great deal of confusion about who needs to be tested. People are sneezing and coughing their way through the season, and many do not know if they have the virus. Health care providers can use social media channels to explain the symptoms of the virus. Then, people will know if those sneezes and coughs are just allergies, the flu, or something more serious.</p>\r\n<p>Also, providers can give directions for people to follow. Do readers need to visit a provider? Should patients try telemedicine? Maybe social media followers need to self-isolate. Providing this information takes the burden off emergency rooms and urgent care facilities. It also helps people stay healthy.</p>\r\n<h3>Show the steps that the practice is taking to keep people healthy</h3>\r\n<p>People are afraid and want to be reassured. That includes knowing that medical practices and dental offices are taking proper precautions to combat the spread of COVID-19. Practices are encouraged to use social media to explain how they are keeping the office clean and free of contamination. That can include sanitation practices and screening policies.</p>\r\n<h3>Educate about telemedicine</h3>\r\n<p>While the world is focused on COVID-19, Americans still deal with other health issues. Some have high blood pressure, while others take medications that must be monitored. Practices can use social media to educate the public about telemedicine as a viable option. Many people are excited to embrace telemedicine instead of exposing themselves while at an office.</p>\r\n<h2>Make social media part of your public outreach strategy</h2>\r\n<p>Public outreach is more important than ever before. Your patients are nervous and unsure of what to expect. Many will turn to you for advice and information. Speak directly to them through your social media channels. By providing resources and information, you can help limit the spread and ensure that people receive the necessary treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Uncertainty hangs in the air as the stock market takes<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/times-of-uncertainty-can-create-value-for-your-customers-in-new-and-necessary-ways/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the entire world into a crisis. Uncertainty hangs in the air as the stock market takes a plunge, oil prices go into free fall, and several businesses panic, not knowing what to expect. The fact is, uncertainty is a constant element. It is always there, and like the weather, it is out of people&#8217;s control.</p>\r\n<p>At this stage, businesses have two options to either get swept up by the uncertainties or take charge and innovate to create value for their customers in new and important ways.</p>\r\n<h2>Handling Uncertain Times as a Business Owner</h2>\r\n<p>During uncertain times, leaders are bound to make reflexive decisions such as halting hiring, reducing investments, cutting marketing and brand investments, and even ceasing decisions completely. These defensive measures are entirely reasonable and may even be necessary for survival in these uncertain times.</p>\r\n<p>However, they could be counterproductive in the short and long term. Such decisions could also put companies at a disadvantage in the aftermath of the crisis when situations improve.</p>\r\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\r\n<p>An effective solution is to adopt the right approach and mindset. Instead of reacting instinctively to the news and situation resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, businesses can act quickly and proactively to change their path and follow another. This path can include focusing on new and innovative ways to add value to their customers. Ultimately, when it comes to value, prospective customers are the ones who can determine what counts as value and what does not.</p>\r\n<p>To create value, business owners need to understand how their customers define value and how they can meet those demands. This means understanding how the current situation is affecting them and thinking innovatively. Customers often have major considerations about value, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cost impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Revenue impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Risk impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Value impact</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Cost impact</b></p>\r\n<p>Customers want to cut down on unnecessary expenses. When developing new solutions, business owners need to consider how much money their customers will save by recognizing and adopting the change over the status quo.</p>\r\n<p><b>Revenue impact</b></p>\r\n<p>The value proposition should offer potential customers an opportunity to increase their revenue. They will be more willing to adopt changes if ignoring the new value offering means that they might miss out on potential revenue.</p>\r\n<p><b>Risk impact</b></p>\r\n<p>When thinking of new ways to deliver value, business owners should look for ways to mitigate or eliminate risk factors that customers may face with the current products or services.</p>\r\n<p><b>Value impact</b></p>\r\n<p>New values should help customers achieve their goals faster and more reliably. This also means allowing customers to realize the impact of adopting new values on functional, corporate, and personal goals.</p>\r\n<h2>Stay Informed</h2>\r\n<p>Business owners need to understand what drives the value determination of their customers and key stakeholders. This also means assessing and exposing the costs, limitations, and risks associated with their present situation. It demands carefully aligning with the most critical aspects of the purpose, approach, and capabilities of the business with the things that matter or are valuable to the customers. With the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, now is the time to get innovative and create new and necessary value.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
