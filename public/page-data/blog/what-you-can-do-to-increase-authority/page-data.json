To effectively strengthen your medical practice’s credibility and expertise in your field, focus your efforts on improving your site’s SEO and developing your brand both online and in the real world.</p>\r\n<h2>How to increase authority online</h2>\r\n<p>When talking about a company’s authority, it helps to think of this term as having a two-fold meaning. In one sense, the word “authority” indicates whether a medical practice is seen as a leader in its field that consumers can readily trust and rely on due to significant expertise and experience. However, in the world of digital marketing, companies are also concerned with website authority, which is closely connected with the site’s SEO.</p>\r\n<h3>SEO and website authority</h3>\r\n<p>One of the main factors search engines consider when producing the search engine results pages for a specific keyword or topic is how trustworthy and well-regarded each website is. The more credible and popular the site, the more likely it is to rank high on the SERP. While there is some level of obscurity even among experts on every feature search engines consider when determining these rankings, there are several factors every company should consider when first creating or enhancing a website:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Quality Content: </strong>While a polished website that neatly lists your practice’s services and contact location is a good start, creating high-quality, relevant content through <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly\">blog posts</a> and other information content can help guide qualified leads to your site and increase your overall authority for SEO.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Backlinks: </strong>Using backlinks to other websites in your content and in turn being linked to on others’ websites are another important way to boost authority. When link building, carefully monitor which sites link to your content. Sites that have low authority can actually hurt your website’s SEO and should be <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en\">disavowed</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reviews: </strong>Having a large number of positive reviews, especially those with well-crafted descriptions, can have a positive effect on potential patients and boost your SEO. For Google, make sure your <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\">Google My Business</a> account is fully set up, and take time to review and respond to any reviews that are left.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How to increase real-world authority</h2>\r\n<p>While an authority medical site is more likely to rank higher on search engines, your practice’s authority extends beyond online presence. Make sure your business is well-branded and as clean and polished in person as it looks on your website. Strive to be a leader in your field, seeking opportunities to be innovative and to offer niche services that set you apart from the competition. Maintain open lines of communication and stay active on social media, taking care to address any questions and concerns from current and potential patients. Use opportunities as they present themselves to establish your expertise in your field of study, whether that means publishing content, creating instructional videos, or taking part in presentations.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn how digital marketing can help you increase authority</h2>\r\n<p>A quality website and strong digital marketing strategy are essential components of an authority medical site.

Knowing exactly<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/understanding-your-brand/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When it comes to having a successful marketing strategy, understanding your medical practice brand is a critical component. Knowing exactly who you are and what you are about as a practice can be a key element to creating and communicating a strong brand presence and increasing your appeal to potential patients. </p>\r\n<h2>Know what makes your practice unique</h2>\r\n<p>There is a reason why you decided to run your own practice. Considering this can help you better understand what defines your brand. The &#8220;why&#8221; behind your process can make your practice more appealing to patients. </p>\r\n<h3>Identify your personality</h3>\r\n<p>Figuring out your personality and company culture as a practice can make it more relatable to your target patients. Do you have an older staff, play soft music, and keep many plants around the office? This personality could be more suited to senior generations. Decisions about office staff and ambiance should not be arbitrary but part of your strategy to communicate your brand and gain patient loyalty. </p>\r\n<h3>Define your voice</h3>\r\n<p>Every practice has a brand voice, whether it is intentionally or unintentionally conveyed. Everything from the demeanor of your staff to the language used on your website sets the tone for your patients&#8217; experience. Is your voice encouraging and empowering? Informative and friendly? Professional and ambitious? Knowing how you want to be perceived by your patients can help you determine which voice to use and be purposeful in expressing it.</p>\r\n<h3>Create a visual identity</h3>\r\n<p>In conjunction with language, the way your office and website look can have a tremendous impact on your brand. Do they have a modern, edgy appearance or a classic, comfortable feel? Everything from the color of the paint and the pictures on the walls to the layout of your webpage communicates the brand of your practice. Tailoring the design of your office and website to appeal to your target patients can help entice them to visit your office as well as make them feel comfortable while there.</p>\r\n<h2>Understand the benefits of branding for patients</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15\">Forbes</a>, the right branding can help you make a lasting first impression that can both attract new clients and impress the ones you have. When you clearly communicate the type of practice you run and what makes it special, it takes that guesswork out of the equation for patients and can put them at ease about visiting your office for the first time. The more comfortable patients feel about their visit, the more likely they are to have a positive experience and become loyal patients for life. </p>\r\n<h2>Reach target patients more effectively</h2>\r\n<p>The Doctor Genius team knows gaining and retaining patients is the lifeblood of your practice.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.
