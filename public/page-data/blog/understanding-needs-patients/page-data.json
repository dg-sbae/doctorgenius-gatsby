Whether you call them customers, patients or clients, they all have one main factor in common: they are at your business for quality service. Understanding the needs of one’s consumers can help to enhance the success of one’s private practice. There is now a national holiday for just such a purpose.\r\n<h3>National Get to Know Your Customers Day</h3>\r\nNational Get to Know Your Customers Day occurs the third Thursday of every quarter, writes nationaldaycalendar.com. The website adds that this holiday is to “Make it a point to get to know a little more about your customers and make each of them feel like they are your most important customer of the day.” While that may not always be possible, understanding the needs of the patient and listening to the patient’s requests before replying can benefit the experience.\r\n\r\nAccess Development gathers statistics of customer loyalty from 2016 and finds that “27 percent of small business owners estimate that 11-20 percent of first-time customers don’t return to their business.” While this applies to a store instead of a professional practice, it stills brings a strong point that people will be more likely to avoid making a return visit if the experience is negative.While people may not enjoy dental checkups in the same way they enjoy a movie, a positive or negative experience at a dentist can lead to the patient deciding to search elsewhere for oral health care. Fortunately, professionals can take a few simple steps to help ensure patients feel more comfortable and valued at the practice.\r\n\r\nWhile people may not enjoy dental checkups in the same way they enjoy a movie, a positive or negative experience at a dentist can lead to the patient deciding to search elsewhere for oral health care.

Utilizing a website to display information for services that people continually look for in a dental practice can help the business. A website that is mobile-first, meaning that it displays well on both computer and phone devices, will also allow people to research a practice from anywhere. A 2016 study by hitwise of Connexity, finds that 68 percent of online searches on a mobile device concerned health.\r\n\r\nBuying customer loyalty is not the key to a successful practice, providing a comfortable and effective experience is the key to success. One method to help build customer loyalty is to ensure that the content on the website matches what the practice offers. For instance, if a dental practice website writes about professional in-office teeth whitening procedures but does not offer the procedure, the patient is going to feel cheated and not return. Consistency is crucial to building trust.\r\n\r\nDoctor Genius can help clients develop an effective website for their private practice and bring in more patients with specialized content.

Professionals are growing more accustomed to patients avoiding treatment until it is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, a new trend may put patients in more danger and more risk of causing permanent damage than they realize with new DIY, Do It Yourself, orthodontic straightening options.\r\n\r\n<h3>DIY needs more than just instructions</h3>\r\n\r\nIn a report from ABC Action News in Philadelphia, PA, available on 6abc.com, the article states “Orthodontists say this alarming trend appears to be on the rise,” adding that, “Most likely it&#8217;s due to the cost and time it takes for professional straightening.” DIY trends are popular for multiple reasons, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Achieving a sense of accomplishment</li>\r\n \t<li>Saving money</li>\r\n \t<li>Personalizing a useful product to use in the house</li>\r\n \t<li>Creating a fun activity to spend time with others</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHowever, a DIY tooth straightening is not similar to an at-home cure for a sore throat or skin moisturizer. There is a reason that orthodontists are required to have two to three extra years of studying in dental school to specialize in orthodontics and patients need to realize that. The DIY teeth-straightening products range from self-placing rubber bands for closing gaps to even using 3D printer technology for creating orthodontic trays. The American Association of Orthodontics, AAO, explains in further detail on their website, mylifemysmile.org that they are “urging consumers to beware of Internet videos and websites which encourage people to try and straighten their own teeth.”\r\n\r\nThe DIY teeth-straightening products range from self-placing rubber bands for closing gaps to even using 3D printer technology for creating orthodontic trays. Orthodontic dentists have the tools, knowledge and skills necessary to safely perform straightening procedures. Self-straightening options will only cause more issues and risk further damage to the individual’s teeth.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-477\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h3>Help patients understand the risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be easy for patients to choose a DIY solution instead of a professional procedure after comparing the cost. Patients need to understand why they need to seek professional treatment as opposed to these cheap and dangerous DIY solutions. One effective method of doing this is to create a website that conveys this message.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The American Association of Orthodontics, AAO, explains in further detail on their website, mylifemysmile.org that they are “urging consumers to beware of Internet videos and websites which encourage people to try and straighten their own teeth.”</h5>\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we can help create and maintain an active website that presents the necessary information of a professional’s practice in a readable and informative manner. The AAO continues to highlight that DIY treatment options can lead to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Permanent tooth loss</li>\r\n \t<li>Lifelong dental problems</li>\r\n \t<li>Spending more money to repair the excess damage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPatients need to understand from a professional’s website and visits to the professional&#8217;s office that DIY solutions are not an effective substitute for professional care. Doctor Genius can also highlight and display the professional’s specialties in such a way as to help inform possible patients about these services. At Doctor Genius, we also help build and maintain social media pages to actively engage followers and patients online.\r\n\r\nBy actively engaging patients and displaying information in an effective manner, we can help professionals bring patients in for the safe and necessary care they need.

With the digital market growing and becoming a prominent factor for all types of businesses, it is crucial for a business to maximize their online presence. This statistic applies to private dental practices as well as various forms of shopping, with more people reading reviews online, researching practice websites, comparing procedure rates and locations before scheduling an appointment.\r\n<h3>Oh, the platforms your practice will end up on</h3>\r\nWhen possible patients search for a practice online, the location is one of the key factors in making a decision. In fact, a common search term is “professional dentist near me.” Thus, many possible patients will end up on Google Maps, searching for a practice near their location that will accept their insurance.\r\n\r\nIn an article written by Raj Nijjer and posted on geomarketing.com, Nijjer lists four ways to drive in-store traffic with Google Maps. The four steps are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Be there when people search for you on Google</li>\r\n \t<li>Happy customers make great promoters</li>\r\n \t<li>Pictures show what’s exceptional</li>\r\n \t<li>Give people an insider view</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAlthough these steps seem basic, they are fundamental in helping to promote a private practice. Google Maps has the ability to display more than simply the location of a company, so companies need to utilize all possible tools. Include the basics on a Google Maps profile with hours, practice title and any promotion deals available. By giving patients a location and images of an actual property, it validates the practice by making it a real website for the patient.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-422\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h3>You control how potential patients see your practice</h3>\r\n<h5>In 2013, GE Capital Retail Bank’s Second Annual Shopper Study found that 81 percent of shoppers research online before visiting the actual store.</h5>\r\nWhile a practice cannot control the thoughts or reactions of patients online and in the office, a practice can control the image that they present online. As Nijjer stated, “Happy customers make great promoters.” Reviews are a crucial part of the decision-making process. While the patient can write whatever they feel like writing, a positive review will go a long way to helping bring new patients into the practice.\r\n\r\nIt is also crucial to respond to a negative review with a professional answer. People may search for a negative review to figure out if the review is real or false. The review needs to have a name and cannot be anonymous. It can also beneficial for the practice to respond to the client’s review.\r\n\r\nAlong with providing patient feedback online, a practice can also provide professional photos of the practice. Similar to how a restaurant produces photos of signature dishes and the dining area, a private dental practice will benefit from posting professional photos of the dental chairs, machinery, waiting room and more.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Doctor Genius can help to provide the digital platform for a private practice and provide quality control for the practice’s website. We will create a new website for the practice and help the practice maintain an active presence online. If you are looking to rank higher on Google searches and develop a stronger online presence, then do not hesitate to seek professional services with Doctor Genius.\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
