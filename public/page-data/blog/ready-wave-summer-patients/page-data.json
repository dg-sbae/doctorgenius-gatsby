With better thoughts of feeling the sand between one’s toes at the beach, going on vacation, relaxing at home, playing video games and spending time with friends outside of school, children do not even consider the idea of visiting the dentist unless they absolutely have to. However, before school starts up, late summer is the perfect time for parents to bring their child to the dentist. Dentists and other medical professionals need to be ready.\r\n<h3>Catch the wave and bring in more patients</h3>\r\nWith any type of medical practice, summer can easily become the busiest season of the year, especially in the end of July and throughout August, when school is fast approaching. Parents are desperate to get their children in for an appointment before school starts back up and schedules become more complex with a large variety of extracurricular activities.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, finds that students lose more than 51 million hours of school each year to oral diseases and other dental-related illnesses. Dentists have an excellent opportunity to provide the necessary checkup and professional cleaning a child needs to remain healthy.\r\n\r\nBy displaying a professional practice in such a way to showcase how parents can prevent their child from missing school and keep their child healthy, a dental practice will be able to begin bringing in more clients. At Doctor Genius, we can:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Create a call-tracking system to help schedule new patients</li>\r\n \t<li>Give the client a website that helps the practice stand out in the digital market</li>\r\n \t<li>Help the client showcase the best qualities of their practice to potential patients</li>\r\n \t<li>Help clients maintain a constant flow of patients throughout the year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEven if the practice presents the benefits of summer appointments on a website, it is in the style and details of the presentation that will truly help a practice stand out.\r\n<h3>Don’t miss out on this opportunity</h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-619\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<div style=\"width: 300px; border-left: 3px solid #666666; margin-center: 1px; padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n\r\nIn fact, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, finds that students lose more than 51 million hours of school each year to oral diseases and other dental-related illnesses.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we have the tools and technology to help you showcase your practice and build a strong digital presence online. With summer in full swing and school quickly approaching, do not miss out on the opportunity to bring in more patients and reach greater levels of success.\r\n\r\nWhile bringing in new patients is great for a medical practice, retaining patients is another crucial step. Doctor Genius can also utilize specific strategies to help with patient retention and generate a healthy annual flow of patients. We know how to target specific patients, such as parents searching for a dentist or other medical practice to help give their kid that checkup before school starts.

With multiple options for almost every medical practice in a single city, the competition can get fierce. While patients can utilize free website builders for a quick one-page site, they do not have the skills or internet know-how to continue maintenance on a website.\r\n\r\n<h3>The tools are only as useful as the skills of the holder</h3>\r\n\r\nAs any medical professional will know, having the tools and knowing how to properly use them are two entirely different things. A dentist can have the latest technology, but lack the skills for the proper use. It is the same way with creating an online platform to display one’s practice. At Doctor Genius, our clients are skilled medical professionals who put in the time for the credentials, but do not necessarily have the prowess to keep an effective online presence.\r\n\r\nAn example of a new tool that has pros and cons is the Website Builder available on Google My Business. In an article on searchengineland.com, Senior SEO Manager and Columnist Tony Edward, reviews the new builder. While this builder can help professionals create a one-page website, there are several cons to the process, including only offering a “One-page site, no option to create additional pages,” Edward writes.\r\n\r\nEdward also finds that there is no ability to add custom page titles, no analytics integration and no ability to add call-to-action buttons. With other cons in the article, it is apparent that this new website builder will not benefit anyone searching for a website that can continue to rank, bring in new patients and continue to expand over time. Doctor Genius can offer the website platform while also providing the services to help truly enhance a practice.\r\n\r\n<h3>We can make the process easy</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-630\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> While this builder can help professionals create a one-page website, there are several cons to the process, including only offering a “One-page site, no option to create additional pages,” Edward writes.</p></div>\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we have a team of web developers, designers and support technicians on-site to help keep our clients’ websites running smoothly and bringing in new patients.

You put together the poster board or create a PowerPoint, gather facts and statistics, and present it to people. When it comes to presenting information in a classroom or on a website, there is one main factor that can make or break a presentation: how one organizes and displays the content.\r\n\r\n<h3>An ever-changing market</h3>\r\n\r\nThe 2017 State of Inbound report finds that the top challenge for 63 percent of marketers is generating traffic and leads. While anyone can make a post or write a blog, the correct quality content will make all the difference. In order to help a professional practice receive an increase of views on a website, the patient needs to have easy-to-access content on the site and ensure that it is the right information people need to find.\r\n\r\nIn a 2015 study, Google finds that 65 percent of smartphone users search for the relevant information, no matter who is providing the information. With at-home products allowing people to utilize voice search instead of typing searches online, patients will use certain keywords or terms that may limit search results.\r\n\r\nWith so many alternative methods for seeking a medical practice and a constantly changing digital market, medical professionals need to know how to navigate the digital market.  Medical professionals have the skills and knowledge to treat patients for a variety of conditions, but may not have the knowledge on how to present and market that skill.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Doctor Genius knows how to present and organize content in an effective manner for better results.\r\n\r\n<h3>Presenting material effectively</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-618\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> The 2017 State of Inbound report finds that the top challenge for 63 percent of marketers is generating traffic and leads.</p></div>\r\n\r\nA website with too much information will make it difficult for people to navigate a medical professional’s website.
