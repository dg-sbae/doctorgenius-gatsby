According to Solution Reach, patient attrition rates<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-retain-patients/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Patient retention is a more significant problem than patient acquisition for many medical practitioners. According to Solution Reach, <a href=\"https://www.solutionreach.com/infographics/6-ways-to-retain-your-patients\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.solutionreach.com/infographics/6-ways-to-retain-your-patients\">patient attrition rates hover between 10% and 30%,</a> on average. However, research shows that making patient retention an integral part of practice management can reduce attrition rates by as much as 70%. If patient retention is not among your practice&#8217;s top priorities, it should be. Read why patient retention is so important and learn some strategies that you can use to improve it.</p>\r\n<h2>Focusing on Patient Satisfaction</h2>\r\n<p>According to the data, 70% of patients leave a practice because of the practice&#8217;s indifference. That means that only 30% of patients leave because of uncontrollable factors like job loss, income reduction, relocation, and other major life events. This information shows that one of the best ways to raise retention rates is to create a better patient experience.</p>\r\n<p>Keeping patients happy by making them feel valued can improve retention. Some ways to do this are treating patients as partners in their healthcare journey and using compassionate bedside manners when interacting with them. Keeping patients informed and following up with them after an appointment can also result in better patient experiences and retention rates.</p>\r\n<h3>Lowering Wait Times</h3>\r\n<p>Patient satisfaction is also affected by the wait time. Medical practitioners with wait times around 60 minutes received an average satisfaction score of 53 from patients. However, those whose wait times no longer than 10 minutes had average satisfaction scores of 77. For every 10 minutes of additional wait time, scores dropped between six and 10 points. Try to keep the office running as smoothly and efficiently as possible to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction.</p>\r\n<h3>Making Healthcare Convenient</h3>\r\n<p>Younger generations value convenience across all aspects of their lives, including healthcare. Convenience is among their top five priorities. Here are some elements of convenient healthcare:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Ability to get test results without seeing a doctor</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Ability to view health information in one place</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Convenient location and hours</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Convenient scheduling</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Easy check-in</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Online bill pay</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Online registration</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Wait time visibility</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Offices that are not doing any of the above may want to update their processes.</p>\r\n<h3>Asking for Feedback</h3>\r\n<p>A practice can not know how its patients feel unless they ask. <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-location-for-feedback-can-solve-management-problems/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-location-for-feedback-can-solve-management-problems/\">Incorporate ways to solicit feedback</a> from patients, both in-office and online.

If you are looking to increase<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/why-google-reviews-can-be-more-authentic-than-yelp/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The number of reviews on Google far surpasses those on other local review sites. If you are looking to increase your practice&#8217;s online reviews to appeal to more patients, it is better to focus on Google reviews over Yelp reviews. Here are some reasons to concentrate your efforts on Google reviews.</p>\r\n<h2>A Better Way To Promote a Practice</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571\">BrightLocal</a>, Google reviews can be the way to go when looking to improve SEO ranking. Using the right review platform can make marketing efforts as productive as possible. Reports from <a href=\"https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/\">ReviewTrackers</a> show 63.6% of people check Google reviews before choosing a business to visit. Putting more time into increasing reviews on other platforms may not receive a favorable investment return. As the average star rating on Google is notably higher than on Yelp, a business is more likely to benefit from a higher rating on Google than Yelp. </p>\r\n<h3>Avoid the Negative Impact of Yelp</h3>\r\n<p>The ReviewTrackers report also notes that most people use filters when searching to eliminate any business with less than a four-star rating. Yelp may exclude one&#8217;s practice from search results before even being viewed since it has a lower average rating. In this case, the practice will be affected by a lack of visibility.</p>\r\n<h3>Encourage Patients To Leave Google Reviews</h3>\r\n<p>While not all reviewers will use Google, it can be beneficial to encourage patients to review one&#8217;s practice on the desired platform. Rather than use vague language when asking for a review, mention Google specifically. Most people tend to follow directions, and because Google is a widely popular platform as well as user-friendly, it should be simple for patients to leave a review on Google.</p>\r\n<h3>Add a Direct Link</h3>\r\n<p>Another tip is to add a website link that leads directly to the Google review form. This addition will make it easier for patients to leave reviews on that site instead of having to pull one up by themselves. Many practices send patients an email after treatment or procedures to ensure they are recovering well and are not experiencing any unexpected side effects. Asking specifically for a Google review and adding a direct link in this type of email can remind patients who may have forgotten to leave a Google review.</p>\r\n<h2>Draw Patients in With Positive Reviews</h2>\r\n<p>Our team at Doctor Genius knows how important it is to get good online reviews.

This strategic<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/sources-of-positive-pr-for-small-practices/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Engaging in public relations is an excellent way for local organizations to grow and promote their small practice. This strategic communications process helps businesses build a positive public image and develop beneficial relationships with the public. Public relations is not just for large businesses but is beneficial for smaller, local practices as well. It is possible to build your practice&#8217;s image without an expensive public relations agency. Here are some public relations activities that you can implement.</p>\r\n<h2>Earning Attention and Trust</h2>\r\n<p>Specialized knowledge or experience can give a practice a leg up on the competition. Share timely and relevant stories across channels to earn people&#8217;s trust and attention. An example of this is developing a list of professional tips to help prospective patients or other medical professionals in the community and publishing it in a local paper, magazine, or <a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6671-public-relations-solutions.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6671-public-relations-solutions.html\">popular online source</a>. </p>\r\n<h3>Knowing the Community</h3>\r\n<p>In small communities, events like sporting games, fairs or festivals, and fundraisers are excellent ways to get one&#8217;s name out in public. Practices can sponsor a sports team or concert, operate a booth at an event, or volunteer with a nonprofit charity. These activities will help with name recognition and also boost reputation. </p>\r\n<h3>Putting Together a Media Kit</h3>\r\n<p>A media kit is a collection of information about a business for the press. This kit provides reporters and editors with the information they need to write about the business. Media kits should be up to date and available at all times, as it is possible to make a connection with someone willing to promote one&#8217;s practice at any time.</p>\r\n<h3>Building Relationships</h3>\r\n<p>Relationships are essential to public relations, whether with reporters, media outlets, or social media influencers. Identify those who have influence and build those relationships. People and outlets like this have already earned their followers&#8217; trust, so the people and products they recommend are likely to be taken seriously. </p>\r\n<h3>Being Patient</h3>\r\n<p>Small practices can be impatient when it comes to producing results from public relations activities. It is important to remain patient as it can take three to six months to reap the benefits. Reputation development is a long-term investment that will build recognition and create trust over time.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a Positive Reputation</h2>\r\n<p>Small practices have very different marketing and public relations needs than large ones.
