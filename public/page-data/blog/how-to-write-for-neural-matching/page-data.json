Although search engine providers do not reveal specific algorithms to the public, the artificial intelligence tools used in programming provide a more specific search experience for users. SEO content creators must take new algorithm changes into account when mapping out <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/\">future strategies</a> to avoid getting stuck with outdated methods and losing vital search ranking positions. </p>\r\n<h2>Neural matching and SEO strategizing</h2>\r\n<p>Modern techniques in search engine content formatting benefit both service providers and search engine users by making it easier to make a connection between the two groups. When formulating a strategy for keyword optimization, SEO content creators should utilize new techniques. </p>\r\n<h3>How does neural matching work? </h3>\r\n<p>Unlike more outdated artificial intelligence, the AI used in neural matching dives deeper into the reasoning behind searches to better analyze the user&#8217;s thought process and retrieve more meaningful and relevant content. By using a more thorough AI analysis, the search engine taps into a more diverse database of content. More diverse content retrieval means the user is more likely to connect with the sought-after results instead of more superficial, though related, content.</p>\r\n<p>To simplify the process, neural matching allows the search engine to better understand what the user is trying to find, resulting in more relevant content. The easiest way for these algorithms to diversify the search is to not only pull in content that has exact or closely related keywords to the user&#8217;s search input but also synonyms to those keywords and the associated content. The reasoning behind pulling in this related information is to help the user reach the intended result even if the search terms were not a perfect match. </p>\r\n<h3>How does neural matching affect SEO strategies? </h3>\r\n<p>Search engines utilizing AI that better understand the reasoning behind a user&#8217;s search keywords leads to a more personalized user experience. To fall in line with a more customized search and maintain high search engine rankings, SEO content writers must adapt to the use of neural matching algorithms. Traditional SEO features strategically-placed keywords and phrases as a part of content formatting.</p>\r\n<p>One of the key adaptation techniques is to anticipate the related keywords the algorithm pulls into searches and integrate them into the writing as well. Using this strategy helps the algorithm make more intelligent connections between keywords and their synonyms without affecting rankings. If a site&#8217;s ranking does slip as search engines adjust, the effect is likely temporary and can be mitigated by using a slightly modified SEO strategy. </p>\r\n<h2>Learn about the latest marketing strategies</h2>\r\n<p>Being able to adjust your current SEO and marketing strategies is the key to remaining relevant in the search engine ranking game.

However, dentists and medical professionals as a whole, need more than simple facts stated on a page. Starting out as a content writer, I strove to find the balance between providing well-researched academic information and speaking to a general audience. Writing for Doctor Genius has only improved my competence in authoring technical and patient-friendly medical content. In turn, my work and time with Doctor Genius have also enhanced our internal writing standards as I have become well-versed in what constitutes industry-best practices.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The three main areas I have learned to consider when writing for Doctor Genius are the sources or facts of the content itself, the SEO terminology, and creating comprehensible content in an easy-to-digest platform. My name is Nick Adams, and I am the Lead Editor at Doctor Genius, going on four years with the Company.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A Bit About Myself and the Content Team</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I started as a content writer at Doctor Genius in 2016, gradually working my way up to lead editor. Starting, I was the only in-house content writer. Now, as the lead editor, I mentor other writers and oversee our final product, creating greater quality control in every piece we produce. While I now focus more on editing and writing specialized content, my goal remains the same: improving our professionalism and readability standards, translating into improved client ranking, connecting more new patients to clients. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While the goal was the same, it was not easy to expand the styles and forms of content beyond what we had. After four years, I have been able to help the content department grow with the help of my manager, Alexander Hess. With his guidance, we continue to focus on quality over quantity while expanding our client’s ranking signals in authority and expertise through adding new digital assets.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One Step in the Overall Process</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Our writers’ editing process is more like a conversation, highlighting any corrections or changes to consider and sending it back to them for review. We strive to help our writers grow in their skills while also expanding their knowledge. Even after our writers complete the training, we encourage them to continue learning. When we assign a writer a custom content order, they will start researching the various keywords, the client’s medical specialty, and anything else they need to know.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even though the content department is only one part of the process, it is crucial to follow any instructions and strive for content that will help boost the client’s online presence. Once the writer finishes the content, I will review it and mark-up any changes they need to see before passing it back. After a final review, the content is ready to move on through to production for installation to the website.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- Start Author Panel -->\r\n<p>\r\n<style>\r\n    .author-panel {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-direction: row;\r\n        font-size: 1.0rem;\r\n        line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel.card {\r\n        padding: 2.5%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel p { line-height: 1.5 !important; }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel .panel-text {font-size: 14.5px !important; }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder {\r\n        width: 25%;\r\n        margin: 1% 2.5%\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder img, .author-info {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        max-width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder img {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        height: auto;\r\n        margin-bottom: 15px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info h5 {\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n        font-size: 100%;\r\n        text-decoration: underline\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info ul {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        padding-left: 0;\r\n        width: 100% !important;\r\n        justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel ul li {\r\n        list-style-type: none;\r\n        text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info li {\r\n        font-size: 75%;\r\n        font-style: italic;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .panel-text { width: 72.5%; margin-left: 2.5% }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel h5 { margin-bottom: 0)\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"author-panel card\">\r\n<div class=\"image-holder\"><img class=\"author-image alignnone wp-image-2430 size-thumbnail\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Adams - Lead Editor - Doctor Genius\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-480x480.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><br />\r\n<div class=\"author-info\">\r\n<h5>Nick Adams</h5>\r\n<!-- Uncomment these to utilize: --><!-- <ul><li><a title=\"Author page coming soon!\" disabled>Posts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\">Bio</a></li>-->\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"mailto:nadams@doctorgenius.com\">Email</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-text\">\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After graduating from Azusa Pacific University, with a BA in English-Writing Concentration, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-adams-27630344/\">Nick Adams</a> utilized his writing skills to build a professional career in writing. While at APU, Nick studied various forms and styles of writing, including journalism and technical writing. Before DG, Nick worked in other technical writing roles before shifting his focus on blogs and webpages associated with the medical field of addiction, mental health, and dual diagnosis treatment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2016, we brought Nick on as a Content Writer. Since then, Nick has written, edited, or overseen upwards of 300 separate custom content orders, written various forms of media text (blogs, video scripts, and press releases), and conducted quality control on written content. In total, he has worked on several thousand sites and clocked-in nearly a million words. His dedication, team spirit, and exceptional talent earned him a well-deserved promotion to Lead Editor last Winter. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Under the direction of the head of Content, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Alexander L Hess</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, MBA, Nick is poised to continue his professional-quality work with Doctor Genius. As he describes, “writing is a passion of mine, and I intend to take that passion into my everyday work. With my skills and experience, I plan to continue guiding our content department on our growth path and ensuring our clients receive the quality content they deserve.”</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Author Panel -->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Quality Content Over Quantity</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Creating quality content and helping oversee the creation of said content involves focusing on three main areas mentioned earlier: resources, SEO terminology, and comprehensible content.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Resources</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A major component of writing and editing content involves searching for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\">professional and credible resources</a>. Not only does this help our writers to learn better and understand the topic, but it also helps to flesh out the web pages for patients. The overall goal is to help patients learn and understand the specific service or treatment before scheduling an appointment. We focus on using .org websites, academic sources, and other information databases with this in mind.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SEO Terminology</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While the client has a list of keywords and terms relevant to their services, we strike a balance between SEO and comprehension. This way, the content is not weighed down with too many keywords to the point of being spam— this practice is often referred to as “keyword stuffing.” However, we still strive to use more technical or precise terms somewhere on a page to increase the chance of a patient searching that term online and finding our client’s website. This balance is struck by understanding <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-explains-the-difference-between-neural-matching-and-rankbrain/299713/\">neural matching</a>, which is writing content that will help a search engine present content that greatly matches a searcher&#8217;s intention. By working with our marketing team, we can determine the best course of action for each patient. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Comprehensible Content</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As an editor, I take the necessary time to read content for more than just errors. The content needs to be understandable for patients so that they are comfortable receiving medical services and are more likely to opt for the right treatment. At the same time, we strive to ensure it is factual and informative. This translates into clearly looking through every piece of content for its ability to reach the intended audience in a way that matches their specific needs. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to Start Getting High-Quality Content Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">By our content team continuing to grow, we will continue to offer more new digital assets that improve client ranking.

It helps to make it as easy as possible for potential patients to make an appointment, and we all know the simplest solution is often the right one. Here are some reasons why a good call-to-action phrase can make a difference in your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Simplifying the process</h2>\r\n<p>Even the most creative websites are not going to convert clients if the clients are unsure about what the next steps are. Here are examples of how a CTA can convert potential patients by making it easier for them to buy something or make an appointment. </p>\r\n<h3>It encourages obedience</h3>\r\n<p>From even the earliest years of life, people are used to being told what to do. This explains why a CTA in the form of a command tends to be more effective than one in the form of a question. For example, someone is more likely to click on a link or button that says &#8220;Purchase now!&#8221; than one that says &#8220;Are you ready to purchase?&#8221; Using an <a href=\"http://www.smbceo.com/2018/02/16/why-ctas-are-the-most-important-thing-on-your-website/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.smbceo.com/2018/02/16/why-ctas-are-the-most-important-thing-on-your-website/\">authoritative command</a> can be very convincing for many potential patients. Without a CTA, they can be unsure of what to do next. </p>\r\n<h3>It promotes conversion</h3>\r\n<p>In most cases, a simple, direct CTA can convert a client because it does not require much thought. For example, &#8220;Click here to schedule an appointment&#8221; is effective because it both tells patients what to do and allows them to set an appointment without having to call the office directly. Without that CTA, clients viewing the website would have to make a decision about whether that office was the right choice for them, track down a contact number, and call to set up the appointment. Many customers <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/#6936250b801b\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/#6936250b801b\">will not take the time</a> to do that and will look elsewhere. </p>\r\n<h3>It draws the reader&#8217;s attention</h3>\r\n<p>On a page full of black and white words, a bright red button or bold red text can effectively stand out and pull the reader&#8217;s gaze where you want it to go. While viewers already interested in a product or service may take the time to search a website for how to take the next steps towards making a purchase or appointment, it can take something more extreme to convince a bored viewer to pay attention and seriously consider taking another step. A distinct CTA button as a content format feature can also be easier for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\">mobile viewers</a> to find. </p>\r\n<h2>Discover how we can help your CTA make an impact on your practice</h2>\r\n<p>Whether this is the first article you have read on CTAs or the 400th, Doctor Genius is here to help.
