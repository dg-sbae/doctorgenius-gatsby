The debate persists partially due to the incorrect assumption that content that appears as duplication will automatically be categorized as spam by search engines. At Doctor Genius, we strive to provide the most up-to-date and accurate information for your business. That&#8217;s why learning more about how content duplication affects your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">rankings</a> can help you make informed decisions about the focus of your marketing and content strategies. </p>\r\n<h2>Should businesses avoid duplicate content? </h2>\r\n<p>When thinking about repetitive content on the web, it&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of believing that if your information is too similar to existing information, it will be automatically be ranked lower on searches. Since somewhere between 25-30% of information on the web is repetitive, it would do a great disservice to consider all of it useless or spam. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZY7EmjbMA&amp;feature=emb_title\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZY7EmjbMA&amp;feature=emb_title\">Search engine programming has evolved</a> to anticipate duplicated information and provide solutions. </p>\r\n<h3>What is duplicate content? </h3>\r\n<p>Content on the internet that is duplicated can be due to the same page being used for multiple locations of the same company or through small parts of existing content being directly reused in blogs as a reference to the original material. Although sometimes duplications are used as manipulation or with malicious intent, such as trying to pass off reused content as new, original content, most of the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en-\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en-\">duplicated content</a> on the web is harmless. Often, multiple variations of the same information end up as duplicate content due to publishing both HTTP and HTTPS versions of websites, pages in different languages, and both www and non-www pages. When the same pages are optimized for both website and mobile use, it can also create repetitive content for search engines. </p>\r\n<h3>How do search engines treat duplicate content? </h3>\r\n<p>Search engines, such as Google, look for identical or very similar pages as a regular part of the content ranking process. Instead of rejecting search results that are the same, the results are instead grouped together under the same search. Similar articles appear as alternative options to the first-ranked article instead of being edited out of the search entirely. Whenever possible, the original source of the content ranks highest along with the webpages that have the most visitors. Google, in particular, has updated algorithms to make sure webmasters aren&#8217;t penalized in the rankings due to content duplication. </p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about SEO content</h2>\r\n<p>The idea that duplicate content on the web hurts companies by negatively affecting rankings is a myth that has been perpetuated by predatory SEO competitors. As confirmed by search engine engineers and major companies, repetitive content is expected and accounted for during the programming process, so it does not cause a problem unless it is purposefully overwhelming to the point of spam or clearly tries to pass off some else&#8217;s original content as their own. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Reach out to us</a> to speak with a team member and learn more about our available services. </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

This program combines our digital marketing solutions seamlessly to drive patients to your practice by leveraging content, utilizing our mobile-first web design, social media, online directories, uploading SEO-centered content, and more. This package can help to benefit your practice in multiple ways and help you continue to experience better connect to your patients for years to come.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of the Patient Experience Package</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your practice may provide the quality treatment that patients need, it is not always easy to have an online presence that reflects that. Along with content that displays the message you want your practice to send patients, it is crucial to create a positive patient experience. A patient’s experience typically begins with visiting your website where they then decide if they would like to proceed to appointments.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>What can the Patient Experience Package do for me?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/px\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Px</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers a plethora of benefits, such as:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instilling and promoting proper staff and patient safety</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping ensure patients have a positive experience</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring HIPAA compliance</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping save time, money, and stress</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promoting effective and continued communications with patients</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PMS integration</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leveraging content along with a mobile-first web design</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping websites provide better user experience for ranking</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting up teledentistry</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b><i>Is the patient experience that important for my website?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simple answer is yes. User experience on a website for any medical practice can greatly influence the number of people that see the website and its success. When the right plan in place tailored to the patient’s needs, a dental practice can experience greater success and patient retention. Even with google’s algorithm constantly being updated, an area with consistent importance for ranking is </span><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improving a website&#8217;s user experience</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an article on Search Engine Land, they explain how Google is working to include user experience on websites as a ranking factor. They explain, “That means if Google thinks your website users will have a poor experience on your pages, Google may not rank those pages as high as they are now.” While Google may not enact this update until 2021, there is no reason to avoid getting ready.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius can help enhance the patient experience on your website. Search Engine Land elaborates that the three areas affecting the patient experience on a website are the load time of pages, first input delay, and the visual stability of a page. In fact, Google states in their Webmaster Central Blog that “Through both internal studies and industry research, users show they prefer sites with a </span><a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">great page experience.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these changes on the horizon, it is crucial to have a website and online presence that provides a positive and comfortable patient experience. We can help you build the practice website you need to boost your patients’ experiences from the website to a checkup in the office.

These can include helping drive patient experience and loyalty, streamlining office operations, providing SEO-Centered content, helping clients stay connected with their patients, and promoting workplace safety. Amidst the post-COVID-19 outbreak world that we live in, people are interested in experiences and interactions with medical professionals that do not require unnecessary physical interaction.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can help to create an online system that promotes a positive experience and more. With the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Practice Recovery Blueprint</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we can focus on adjusting your business to meet the needs of these changing times. We will customize the plan for your needs and utilize the Patient Experience Package benefits for even greater results.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>How can you help to streamline office operations?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way to help streamline office operations involves paperless forms on the website. Patients will be able to fill out any and all forms online before the appointment. This way, there are no issues with printing out the forms, filling them out, or forgetting to bring them to the appointment. This can help make sure there is less chance of traffic in the waiting room, as well.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the website can help to get new patients started with scheduling an appointment, we can also use phone systems to help filter calls. This way, the patient will have everything they need to get started from the comfort of their own home.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>Can teledentistry help me remain in contact with my patients?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Teledentistry helps to make the process even easier for patients, allowing them to remain at home during the initial examination. Doctor Genius can help to set up a teledentistry system that will enhance the patient experience. This way, you can continue to communicate with patients, determine if they need to come to the office for treatment, and maintain oral health. This form of patient retention can also help them continue to reach out to your practice with any questions or concerns.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>Will SEO get in the way of my message?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not at all. While we will use SEO-focused content to help promote search results in Google listings, it is only one part of the solution. In fact, we will combine SEO with the type of message you want to send patients. Now, more than ever, patients need to know what practice is about and what they offer without issue. We will work with you to combine these into an effective and complete presentation online. You can find out more about how we are staying up to date on the latest changes in SEO best practices by reading how the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most recent core update affects your practice</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>How do I promote that we are following health and safety guidelines?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can help to ensure that your office has the proper PPE, and standards in place following the COVID-19 outbreak.

Here are some various opportunities in store for dental practices that take a proactive approach.</p>\r\n<h2>The Opportunities that lie ahead</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies are not sitting idly and watching the situation unfold. They have adapted to the current situation and expanded their business models, reordered their production lines, and focused on new needs. The summary is that they have observed the market trends and taken calculated risks, using COVID-19 as the rocket fuel for growth in some areas and resuscitating dormant potentials in others.</p>\r\n<p>Many establishments are moving online, digitizing most of their processes to increase the speed of executing projects and eliminating backlogs. In terms of productivity, there has been a significant rise in cloud services for work collaborations, solutions to reduce paperwork and physical contact, reimbursement apps and digital solutions for accounting, and the rise of contactless devices in several areas.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can help clients build an effective website and system that focuses on reaching patients. We will help to have a set plan in place for when the quarantine restrictions are lifted. The sooner dentists begin taking proactive steps toward the current situation, the sooner they can begin to prepare for success.</p>\r\n<h3>Business models</h3>\r\n<p>A prolonged crisis like this can force changes in customer profiles. Customers’ behavioral patterns are likely to change due to a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, many people will start ordering more regularly and receive door deliveries, even after the lockdown. Others will possibly increase online transactions. Businesses that pay attention to the customer profile changes can go on to build more efficient business models.</p>\r\n<h3>Remote work and service delivery</h3>\r\n<p>Renting an office space can be expensive, and remote work arrangement is yet to be adopted in the full functional scope. This will create opportunities in several and related sectors, including virtual classrooms, office space redesign, development of remote work platforms, online service provisions, software systems, and cloud-based services. All of these sectors will potentially witness drastic expansion when the world starts to recover from the pandemic, and employers look to reduce the cost of office space if their staff needs to work remotely.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us Today</h2>\r\n<p>The effects of the COVID-19 is under review by many experts, both in terms of medical and business implications. The adverse effects of the pandemic are obvious, but this article seeks to shed light on the opportunities that are available to businesses and other establishments when faced with a crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

The following are potential points to consider.</p>\r\n<h3>Assess the condition of the practice</h3>\r\n<p>Perform a business appraisal and decide what needs to be done urgently. It is crucial to evaluate what a dental practice has and follow current updates with the COVID-19 pandemic. As the U.S. shifts to summer, more and more restrictions will begin to loosen. With that, people will begin returning to their normal routines. Our team can help dentists evaluate what they will need to reopen effectively.</p>\r\n<p>Now is the time to get creative and deal with the situation. The result of the appraisal will provide insights on whatever needs to be adjusted to get the business running.</p>\r\n<h3>Reach out to employees and customers</h3>\r\n<p>While some practices may be open for immediate health emergencies, not every practice can do that. In many cases, practices can reach out to any scheduled patient appointments to re-schedule appointments for a few months in the future. This includes letting them know the delays they might experience with certain services or is available.</p>\r\n<p>Employees need to know if their schedules will change and the nature of work they need to do. They need to know if the practice will be restricting hours or if they will need to work remotely for some time. Our team can help go over teledentistry, what it is, and how it can help practices reach patients at home during COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h3>Reinvent the business</h3>\r\n<p>In fact, it is easier for smaller businesses to modify their business models, switch focus, and get back into the game. Our team will help evaluate how to ensure dentists can effectively reach their patients while also offering advice on how to alter their practice methods during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Pay attention to what customers might need and would buy, and direct business operations toward that. Aside from considering immediate service demands, evaluate past sales for indications of increase, decline, or stagnancy. If sales were declining or stagnant, the downtime might be the time to think about necessary changes to make when the economy gains pace once more.</p>\r\n<h3>Non-equity cash raise</h3>\r\n<p>Seek to raise money from non-equity sources. Develop strategies to get government grants. Consider the SBA initiatives in place to help small businesses. Be inventive about getting sources of cash to stay in business, including making short-term deals that relieve the current crunch.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us to Learn More</h2>\r\n<p>Like virtually everything in life, the COVID-19 pandemic will pass. It is difficult to predict what the economy and the country will look like afterward, but if the company survives this, there are opportunities to grab. Stay alert and get ready to bounce back after the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Fortunately, there is still hope for businesses and private practices. At Doctor Genius, we can help dentists, and other practices maximize their online presence and reach in the digital market. These steps, when done correctly, can help you chart your way toward building a strong, healthy, and resilient practice following the quarantine.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a resilient business after a pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies are creating contingency plans as precautions against COVID-19. Some are implementing or adapting existing plans, while others have to develop new plans. The following are measures that companies can take to build a stronger and healthier business.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider the effect of coronavirus on customers</h3>\r\n<p>Depending on the industry, customers might be experiencing certain difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Business owners need to think strategically about the challenges that customers are facing and what can be done to help them. Using those facts, they can create a new sales pitch and structure their marketing plans to meet those challenges and needs.</p>\r\n<p>Regular business challenges typically worsen during a crisis. Business owners have the role of restructuring their product offerings to address the specific struggles faced by their customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Adopt new sales mediums</h3>\r\n<p>Despite the total lockdown, people will need to make purchases, providing opportunities to offer your products or services through alternative sales channels. For instance, if COVID-19 is halting customer visits to the company’s store, it is time to target and expand eCommerce channels. Business owners need to review their internet marketing efforts and e-commerce sales and see how they provide a boost.</p>\r\n<p>Focus more on conversations on social media and LinkedIn over physical sales meetings. Many B2B companies, especially those who deal with software or digital services and solutions, are already in this realm. The business continues, and more of it might need to go online.</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on long-term investments</h3>\r\n<p>The coronavirus disease situation might be the cue to make long-term investments in the business, especially those in B2B sales. If there is a momentary relapse in sales, then the time is right to reevaluate operations, processes, and existing platforms and get strategic for the long term. If there are major prospects in view, now is the time to dedicate more resources and effort into managing the leads and capitalizing on longer-term opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Monitor the leads, provide reassurances, and let everyone know that there are contingency plans in place and that they can access help when needed. This unparalleled situation is undoubtedly causing many cancellations like concert tickets, airline reservations, and business conferences. Still, high-ticket B2B sales may not suffer as much, unless the crisis continues for longer than anticipated, and companies start to reduce spending and investment.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us to Learn More Today</h2>\r\n<p>Economic recovery might happen earlier than expected. If you fail to position your business strategically, however, you may not be well-placed to build on post-pandemic recovery. Companies can take salient measures now to ensure that they come out of a major crisis like COVID-19 stronger and healthier.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay.

It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
