Knowing exactly<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/understanding-your-brand/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When it comes to having a successful marketing strategy, understanding your medical practice brand is a critical component. Knowing exactly who you are and what you are about as a practice can be a key element to creating and communicating a strong brand presence and increasing your appeal to potential patients. </p>\r\n<h2>Know what makes your practice unique</h2>\r\n<p>There is a reason why you decided to run your own practice. Considering this can help you better understand what defines your brand. The &#8220;why&#8221; behind your process can make your practice more appealing to patients. </p>\r\n<h3>Identify your personality</h3>\r\n<p>Figuring out your personality and company culture as a practice can make it more relatable to your target patients. Do you have an older staff, play soft music, and keep many plants around the office? This personality could be more suited to senior generations. Decisions about office staff and ambiance should not be arbitrary but part of your strategy to communicate your brand and gain patient loyalty. </p>\r\n<h3>Define your voice</h3>\r\n<p>Every practice has a brand voice, whether it is intentionally or unintentionally conveyed. Everything from the demeanor of your staff to the language used on your website sets the tone for your patients&#8217; experience. Is your voice encouraging and empowering? Informative and friendly? Professional and ambitious? Knowing how you want to be perceived by your patients can help you determine which voice to use and be purposeful in expressing it.</p>\r\n<h3>Create a visual identity</h3>\r\n<p>In conjunction with language, the way your office and website look can have a tremendous impact on your brand. Do they have a modern, edgy appearance or a classic, comfortable feel? Everything from the color of the paint and the pictures on the walls to the layout of your webpage communicates the brand of your practice. Tailoring the design of your office and website to appeal to your target patients can help entice them to visit your office as well as make them feel comfortable while there.</p>\r\n<h2>Understand the benefits of branding for patients</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15\">Forbes</a>, the right branding can help you make a lasting first impression that can both attract new clients and impress the ones you have. When you clearly communicate the type of practice you run and what makes it special, it takes that guesswork out of the equation for patients and can put them at ease about visiting your office for the first time. The more comfortable patients feel about their visit, the more likely they are to have a positive experience and become loyal patients for life. </p>\r\n<h2>Reach target patients more effectively</h2>\r\n<p>The Doctor Genius team knows gaining and retaining patients is the lifeblood of your practice.

There are many areas this type of lawyer can help with in addition to litigation, and having a trusted lawyer before you need one can eliminate the stress associated with having to scramble to locate one on short notice.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to find a trusted professional dental lawyer</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to confidential matters and issues that could have a tremendous impact on your practice, the <a href=\"https://ebusiness.ada.org/assets/docs/6850.PDF?OrderID=2104406\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://ebusiness.ada.org/assets/docs/6850.PDF?OrderID=2104406\">American Dental Association</a> recommends choosing your lawyer carefully. Here are methods to use when deciding on a lawyer for your dental practice. </p>\r\n<h3>Consult online resources</h3>\r\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of using a search engine like Google as you begin your query is the ability to see reviews from previous clients. Although some opinions may be a bit extreme, reviews can typically provide a general overview of how professional and successful a lawyer has been in the past. </p>\r\n<h3>Take advantage of your network</h3>\r\n<p>Odds are good you know someone at another practice who has used a dental lawyer before, a friend or relative who is a lawyer in this area, or experience with dental law. Be bold about asking peers for a referral. People are not likely to recommend someone to you unless they know that person will do a good job. </p>\r\n<h3>Use a lawyer referral service</h3>\r\n<p>Many state and local bar associations often have a lawyer referral service. The lawyers these services refer people to are generally well known and respected in their communities and have a proven track record of success. If this is the route you choose to go, it is more about picking the lawyer who is the right fit for your practice than having to decide whether the lawyer is competent. </p>\r\n<h3>Ask your malpractice carrier</h3>\r\n<p>Because all operating medical practices should have a malpractice carrier, this option is relatively simple. You should already have a representative and a phone number or email address handy. Contact your malpractice representative and ask about respected lawyers who have handled cases similar to yours. </p>\r\n<h3>Talk to your state dental association</h3>\r\n<p>Some state dental associations have approved referral lists of law firms and attorneys. Because these lists typically include lawyers from all over the state, it is important to be aware of the location of the lawyers you are most interested in. If you need legal advice in a specialized area, make sure to ask what kind of experience the lawyer has in that area specifically. </p>\r\n<h2>Turn to us for help</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you need a dental lawyer, assistance with <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\">medical marketing</a>, or ideas on how to improve patient retention, Doctor Genius has you covered.

To effectively strengthen your medical practice’s credibility and expertise in your field, focus your efforts on improving your site’s SEO and developing your brand both online and in the real world.</p>\r\n<h2>How to increase authority online</h2>\r\n<p>When talking about a company’s authority, it helps to think of this term as having a two-fold meaning. In one sense, the word “authority” indicates whether a medical practice is seen as a leader in its field that consumers can readily trust and rely on due to significant expertise and experience. However, in the world of digital marketing, companies are also concerned with website authority, which is closely connected with the site’s SEO.</p>\r\n<h3>SEO and website authority</h3>\r\n<p>One of the main factors search engines consider when producing the search engine results pages for a specific keyword or topic is how trustworthy and well-regarded each website is. The more credible and popular the site, the more likely it is to rank high on the SERP. While there is some level of obscurity even among experts on every feature search engines consider when determining these rankings, there are several factors every company should consider when first creating or enhancing a website:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Quality Content: </strong>While a polished website that neatly lists your practice’s services and contact location is a good start, creating high-quality, relevant content through <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly\">blog posts</a> and other information content can help guide qualified leads to your site and increase your overall authority for SEO.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Backlinks: </strong>Using backlinks to other websites in your content and in turn being linked to on others’ websites are another important way to boost authority. When link building, carefully monitor which sites link to your content. Sites that have low authority can actually hurt your website’s SEO and should be <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en\">disavowed</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reviews: </strong>Having a large number of positive reviews, especially those with well-crafted descriptions, can have a positive effect on potential patients and boost your SEO. For Google, make sure your <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\">Google My Business</a> account is fully set up, and take time to review and respond to any reviews that are left.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How to increase real-world authority</h2>\r\n<p>While an authority medical site is more likely to rank higher on search engines, your practice’s authority extends beyond online presence. Make sure your business is well-branded and as clean and polished in person as it looks on your website. Strive to be a leader in your field, seeking opportunities to be innovative and to offer niche services that set you apart from the competition. Maintain open lines of communication and stay active on social media, taking care to address any questions and concerns from current and potential patients. Use opportunities as they present themselves to establish your expertise in your field of study, whether that means publishing content, creating instructional videos, or taking part in presentations.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn how digital marketing can help you increase authority</h2>\r\n<p>A quality website and strong digital marketing strategy are essential components of an authority medical site.
