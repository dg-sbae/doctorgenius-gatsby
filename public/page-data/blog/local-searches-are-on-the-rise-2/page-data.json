This represents a significant increase in the number of people conducting a local search, determined to connect with a business close by. This can benefit your dental practice by connecting you with a prospective patient that is in immediate need of your services.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Nearby Business Listings product</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>To capitalize on this growing trend, Google is offering a new advertising product. The Nearby Business Listings product replaces some of the typical ad copy with features that consumers use on a regular basis. Features like click-to-call and click-for-directions appear in the ad so that when someone is conducting a local search, they can find a nearby business and immediately connect with them. If the search is a mobile search, the convenience of immediately navigating to the business cannot be overstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a dentist, you should also consider how you can use this knowledge in your current marketing plans. As a company that specializes in optimizing for local search, we recommend that you check all of your online business listings to ensure that your information is accurate. Your name, address, phone number, and hours of operation need to be included with your business listings to ensure that someone can find you in a local search. Additionally, you should optimize your website for mobile users. We recommend building a responsive design website that adjusts based on the type of device that is being used to view it. This will allow your site to have built-in features like click-to-call or click-for-directions. Given how many people conduct a mobile search for a local dentist, this is an easy way to ensure that they call you instead of a dentist down the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneously, your website needs to be optimized for local search. When creating your SEO strategy, it is important to include your location in multiple places on your site. Think of the phrase that people will use when searching for a dental office in your area (or better yet – have us pull the analytics for you). For example, if you are in Orange County, California, do people search for an “OC dentist”, “Orange County dentist”, etc.? The terms and phrases that they would use should be incorporated into the content on your website, giving your site the opportunity to show up when someone does a local search for a “dentist nearby”. After all, the search engines know where you are located based on the information that you give them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can audit your website to ensure that it is mobile friendly and that you are optimized to show up in a local search. This way you can benefit from the increase in mobile searches for a dentist “near me”.</p>","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Digital Marketing"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/trend-04-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/a7715/trend-04-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/9dc27/trend-04-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/4fe8c/trend-04-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/a7715/trend-04-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"10d9bdca-af32-5803-a722-8325e9ef457e"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null},"prevPost":{"title":"Social Media Power Tips for Dentists","slug":"social-media-power-tips-for-dentists","excerpt":"As a dentist, there are easy ways to energize your social media efforts so that you can engage more patients.<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/social-media-power-tips-for-dentists/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"As a dentist, there are easy ways to energize your social media efforts so that you can engage more patients. This will grow your practice and gain patient referrals. If you don’t have a lot of time on your hands, don’t worry – most dentists don’t. Fortunately, these social media tips are so easy that you or your office manager can implement them in between patients. As a result, your organic marketing results will improve.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Write a value proposition.</strong> Update your cover image to include your value proposition so that users immediately know what you are about and how you can help them. For example, “healthy smiles for the entire family”. This will increase the likelihood of someone liking or following your Facebook page when they come across it.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Create a call-to-action.</strong> Content marketing is just as important in social media as it is for your website. Write content that inspires people to act, for example, “click here to read more”. While simple, this tip will increase how many clicks you get.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Build fans organically.</strong> It is okay if your Facebook fan page grows steadily over time. This is far better than purchasing a block of fake fans that don’t live near you and could never use your dental services. The power of organic marketing and social media is the ability to expose your practice to those that live within your local area. Focus on the objective, even if it is one fan at a time.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Create awesome blog posts.</strong> You should include blog writing in your content marketing strategy since it gives you the opportunity to share your knowledge, answer questions and provide information for prospective patients. The more often you blog, the higher your chances are for being viewed as a knowledge leader in the community. Through social media, you can posts your blogs and encourage users to read and comment. You can further tie it into your social media by telling people to ask any questions they have that weren’t answered by the blog post. This can increase your user engagement.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Keep it interesting.</strong> Use a variety of post types in order to keep it interesting for your followers. For example, post a video then a picture and a text post. You should also vary the type of content while always staying relevant to your business or community. As an added benefit, you can review your social media analytics to see what type of posts gets the best reaction from users. This will help you to cultivate a more effective organic marketing strategy.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Use interesting images.</strong> There are a variety of free apps that you can download to edit images. If you want to impose a text onto a photo and aren’t sure how, pull out your smartphone. Most of these will let you take a picture, impose text and post directly to Facebook. PicCollage is an easy one to use and completely free.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to improve your content marketing or social media, call and speak with a Dental SEO Sites representative.","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Practice Management"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/recentpost-02-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/9dc27/recentpost-02-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/4fe8c/recentpost-02-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"a3feb621-2bd4-526a-8aa2-73f3bf8a1cff"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null},"nextPost":{"title":"Use Coupons and Events to Drive Client Conversions","slug":"local-searches-are-on-the-rise","excerpt":"Do you offer coupons and if so, how do they impact your conversions?

This is something that every retailer needs to know and plan for as part of their online marketing. Over the past decade, coupon sites have become more and more popular with affiliates offering a variety of ways to buy something for less money. This can be a good thing when you work with affiliates that have high traffic counts and excellent SEO. After all, the coupons offered on their website can drive more traffic and conversions on yours. The challenge becomes managing the process correctly.\r\n\r\nDo you offer coupons and if so, how do they impact your conversions? This is something that every retailer needs to know and plan for as part of their online marketing. Over the past decade, coupon sites have become more and more popular with affiliates offering a variety of ways to buy something for less money. This can be a good thing when you work with affiliates that have high traffic counts and excellent SEO. After all, the coupons offered on their website can drive more traffic and conversions on yours. The challenge becomes managing the process correctly.\r\n\r\nIn our online marketing plan, be sure to consider how you want to work with your affiliates to ensure that when you do use them to promote coupons, you are not giving up commissions unnecessarily. For example, if someone is in your shopping cart and decides to open a new tab to find a coupon code, the affiliate can track that as a sale using cookies. You will in turn pay a commission, even though the person was on your website first. With that in mind, have your web developer create landing pages and separate URL’s that affiliates can direct traffic to. This will help to keep some of your customers separate. In fact, if you have separate landing pages, you may be able to remove the coupon code section entirely from your main shopping cart. This way the shoppers looking for a discount can come from a coupon site while your regular customers can happily continue paying full price.\r\n\r\nOne way to successfully use coupons is to create promotions on social media. Your Facebook page, for example, is an excellent place to create a graphic with a coupon code or let everyone know that your new inventory is in and the first fifty customers get a discount. With social media, you can drive conversions because these are people that are already familiar with your brand and want to hear from you. People performing a local search are likely to find your website or your social media page, so this is an excellent way to capture business from that traffic as well.\r\n\r\nWe also suggest that you create various events to help drive conversions. This can be used in conjunction with local search by optimizing the content on your website. For example, you could have a trunk sale twice a year and incorporate a breadth of content regarding the issue on your website. That way when users search for one in your local area, your website comes up. Next, promote the trunk sale through social media so that your existing customers can participate. Online promotions and events should be fun and creative so keep that in mind and adjust as needed to drive more conversions.","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Practice Management"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/recentpost-04-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/a7715/recentpost-04-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/9dc27/recentpost-04-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/4fe8c/recentpost-04-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/a7715/recentpost-04-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"3a6b315d-1126-55df-8813-716faeeadd65"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null}},"pageContext":{"currentNode":{"slug":"local-searches-are-on-the-rise-2","wordpress_id":222},"currentID":222,"prevNode":{"slug":"social-media-power-tips-for-dentists","wordpress_id":225},"prevID":225,"nextNode":{"slug":"local-searches-are-on-the-rise","wordpress_id":218},"nextID":218}},"staticQueryHashes":["3603905760"]}
