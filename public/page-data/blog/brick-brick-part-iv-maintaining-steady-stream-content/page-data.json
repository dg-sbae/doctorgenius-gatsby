The<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/brick-brick-part-iv-maintaining-steady-stream-content/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Part three of the “Brick by Brick” series, focused on the need for quality content and what that entails. The crucial aspect of content marketing is the rate of published content for a website. The content rate will help keep a website active and up on the front lines of search results. While the quality of content is important, the rate of content is just as important.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keep it running</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Active content that holds some form of relevance for the website can help to bring in more traffic. In 2015, Ascend2 found that 72 percent of marketers agreed that relevant content creation was the most effective content strategy. While quality is still crucial to promoting a website, there needs to be a steady flow of content. Posting a blog once every few months will not be effective. We can post multiple blogs a month on your website and promote them through social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Software engineer, author, and founder of WanderlustWorker.com wrote in a Forbes article that “in the beginning, Google doesn&#8217;t trust you,” adding, “If Google doesn&#8217;t trust you, you&#8217;re not going to rank on those lucrative first-page SERPs*. You&#8217;ll be lost in the fray amidst millions of others who&#8217;re trying to claw their way to the top.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that people cannot take shortcuts in posting content on a website. “Thin content with errors, or duplicate content and spun content can really hurt you,” Adams explains. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can provide clients with effective content that reaches potential patients on the website and on other social media platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Branching out to other platforms</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Branching Out Into SOcial Media\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-959\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">HubSpot found in 2016 that for the previous two years, content consumption on Facebook had increased by 57 percent.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If online content is one thing, it is versatile. Online content can branch out to multiple platforms of social media that all lead back to the client’s website. By utilizing social media platforms to share content on a website, Doctor Genius can help clients gain increased website traffic. In 2016, HubSpot also found that 76 percent of people use their Facebook feed to find interesting content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius will not only post engaging content onto your website, but we will also create posts for social media accounts that lead patients to your website. This way, potential patients will find a post about your practice in their social media feed that can lead them back to your website.

You want the user experience to be positive and beneficial enough that the individual does not leave the website. While it is fairly easy to build a homepage, it is much more difficult to determine what one needs to put on that homepage and where. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Presentation and representation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While many medical professionals may assume that they do not need a website and rely on word of mouth or reviews on platforms such as Yelp!, a website can reach many more potential patients. Not only expanding a medical professional’s reach, a website can also help to create a platform for patient-professional conversation. However, the content on a home page can make or break a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a home page is too difficult to navigate or does not explain what the professional does in an effective way, then the potential patient is most likely to search elsewhere. Here are a few key factors Doctor Genius implements into a client’s homepage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Navigation bar</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An important tool for any website, a navigation bar is crucial for helping people find what they need. While there will be ads and content on the homepage that may direct the user, the user may be interested in a service that is not the medical professional’s main one. We can customize tabs for various services and information for an easier user experience. This way, the user will not leave a website due to confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-968\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Calls to action</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A home page needs at least one call to action but will benefit from several. Since most medical practices cover multiple procedures, highlighting specific services in these procedures can be extremely beneficial for the professional. Website users will then be able to see specific services immediately upon using the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Curatti.com states that 70 percent of small business websites do not have clear calls-to-action on their homepage.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Images</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having images to support the written content will help give a clear indication of the services. Along with that, the images can help create a style for the website and capture the emotion that patients feel after using the service. Images also promote presentation of the homepage. At Doctor Genius, we place images in crucial locations to help tie the text with a visual cue to reach the reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Location, location, location</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can also help ensure that all necessary information is above the fold. Meaning that when a client first views the homepage, all necessary information is there. We also focus on the placement of information based on users’ habit of reading left to right. With this in mind, we utilize the “Z-pattern,” to help highlight the most crucial areas of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

Medical professionals need accurate and engaging information that reaches out to potential patients and captivates them. However, there are several other purposes for online content outside of being a source of information that portrays a message.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Including keywords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Keywords are a particular word or phrase that help a website rank on search engine results. When someone is in need of a specific medical service, he or she will type in a specific phrase or set of words. We can measure which sets of phrases are more common than others and use them within the content of your website. While keywords can help a website rank, they are not enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keeping a website active</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>HubSpot states that about 53 percent of marketers say that blog content creation is their top inbound marketing priority in 2017. By creating, customizing and posting blogs on a monthly basis, we help to keep your website active and appearing on Google’s radar. This helps Google to see that the lights are still on at home and place your website on the search results. By including these steps and other tools, we can help increase the rank of a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Targeting specific audiences</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We can create content that targets specific demographics and age groups of potential patients. After all, HubSpot found that in 2016, about 43 percent of people admitted to only skimming blog posts. It is no surprise that people are not always going to just stumble onto a blog post from a medical professional’s website. Thus, Doctor Genius will create custom content that targets specific audiences to bring in more website views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With titles and phrases that advertise a specific service, we can help identify the most popular demographic to reach. However, there are other ways to help a blog or website appear in search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Effective Online Content\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-945\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">In 2015, eMarketer found that 8 out of 10 marketers worldwide use location targeting in mobile advertising.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Geo-Targeting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Verge, states that in May of 2017, Google has more than 2 billion monthly active devices on Android. Monthly, Google has over 1 billion people using Chrome, Maps and Search. By creating mobile first websites, we can help our clients reach patients over multiple digital platforms. More importantly, we can target people by area. Geo targeting allows us to customize and build content for people in a specific area. With geo targeting, we help our clients reach areas surrounding the zip code they practice in, as opposed to only reaching residents directly nearby.</p>\r\n<p>By using Doctor Genius, you can feel assured in knowing that we are attempting to reach potential patients through multiple electronic devices in surrounding areas for a better chance at a higher ranking and more patients.
