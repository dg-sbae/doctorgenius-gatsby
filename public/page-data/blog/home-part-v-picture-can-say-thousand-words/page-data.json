Most people prefer pictures that describe the story or advertise the product. If a webpage was going to describe the process for dental implants, people will wonder what a dental implant looks like and how it looks in the mouth. Instead of the individual going to Google for answers and leaving the website, give the individual what he or she wants by including informative images on the webpage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Giving your practice a face</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Images on a website can accomplish a variety of tasks with even only a few pictures, including images of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Your location</li>\r\n \t<li>The head medical professional</li>\r\n \t<li>The team members at the location</li>\r\n \t<li>Various tools and rooms of the facility</li>\r\n \t<li>The map view of practice from Google Maps</li>\r\n \t<li>Your logo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Images can put a face to the practice that act as trust signals for potential patients. For instance, an individual is less likely to consider a practice with no image of the medical professional in charge and only text that states the professional’s background. It is also important to take a few quality photos of the team members, outside of the facility and rooms within the facility as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These images can help people get a clear picture of the location they are considering for professional medical care. It is also beneficial to break up the text on other pages of the website with images showing various services or actual patients rather than stock photography. By utilizing quality content with images that promote a happier response from potential patients, you can increase the chance of people spending more time on your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Buzzsumo states that in 2015, Facebook posts with images saw more than double the amount of engagement than those posts without images.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keeping a strong presence on social media</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1060\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Even with the above statistic, text is still important and people still read. However, people surfing social media will spend less time reading a long post about dental hygiene or another medical service if there is no image. In many cases, people will scroll right by the post without even noticing. Thus, it is important to include images or video in social media posts to promote your practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Buzzsumo also adds that in 2015, articles with an image once every 75 to 100 words, received double the number of social shares than articles with fewer images. While this statistic may change in the following years, it is important to note that images only work in the proper location. Without knowledge on where to place them, people may misuse images or oversaturate a webpage with too many images and not enough content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand the crucial locations to place images and how to use them to help promote a website online.

When it comes to reading most forms of text, few people will read it differently. Thus, when people view a webpage, they will read the same way. However, people do not read everything on a webpage and may skim the page, making it crucial to highlight specific details in easy to read places.</p>\r\n<h3>What people want to see</h3>\r\n<p>Reading is becoming less of a social norm than what it used to be. The Pew Research Center finds that in 2015, around 27 percent of U.S. adults did not read a single book within 12 months. The problem is that this lack of reading does not stop at just books, but it continues to any form of reading, including online content.</p>\r\n<p>Most people may skim or click “Accept” without reading the Terms and Conditions of an IOS update, but people may also skim content on a web page. If someone needs information on dental implants, they may only have one question out of hundreds of possible questions. If the individual finds the answer, then he or she is less likely to stay on the specific page and may “bounce,” or move, to another website.</p>\r\n<p>By placing crucial content in specific spots on a page, we can help ensure that the individual sees the most important information about a practice. This is where the “Z-Pattern” can be effective.</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">Brandon Jones states in a blog on envato tuts+, that “The Z-Layout is a great way to start just about any web design project because it addresses the core requirements for any effective site: branding, hierarchy, structure, and call to action.”</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_1069\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1069\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"600\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2-300x206.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2-177x122.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Understanding the Z Layout; http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-the-z-layout-in-web-design&#8211;webdesign-28</p></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Z-Pattern</h3>\r\n<p>The Z-Pattern is a design that follows the projected route of the eyes when an individual reads, left to right and top to bottom. The pattern starts with the top left of the page to the top right, diagonally down the middle to the bottom left and then to the bottom right. Imagine that the reader makes an imaginary line from the top left to the top right and this line is where a practice needs to include the main components the viewer needs to focus on.</p>\r\n<p>The diagonal line will include the body of content, including bits of information that relate to the main focus. The bottom line will contain the call to action at some point. It is important to note that the Z-Pattern is only useful for pages with less content. For the pages with a large amount of content, we will choose to follow the F-Layout instead.</p>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we know when and how to use these layouts properly and help sell the specifics of the page for you. We can help you customize the website for your practice and maximize the level of access for the information that shows off your practice.
