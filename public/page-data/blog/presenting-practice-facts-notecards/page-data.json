You put together the poster board or create a PowerPoint, gather facts and statistics, and present it to people. When it comes to presenting information in a classroom or on a website, there is one main factor that can make or break a presentation: how one organizes and displays the content.\r\n\r\n<h3>An ever-changing market</h3>\r\n\r\nThe 2017 State of Inbound report finds that the top challenge for 63 percent of marketers is generating traffic and leads. While anyone can make a post or write a blog, the correct quality content will make all the difference. In order to help a professional practice receive an increase of views on a website, the patient needs to have easy-to-access content on the site and ensure that it is the right information people need to find.\r\n\r\nIn a 2015 study, Google finds that 65 percent of smartphone users search for the relevant information, no matter who is providing the information. With at-home products allowing people to utilize voice search instead of typing searches online, patients will use certain keywords or terms that may limit search results.\r\n\r\nWith so many alternative methods for seeking a medical practice and a constantly changing digital market, medical professionals need to know how to navigate the digital market.  Medical professionals have the skills and knowledge to treat patients for a variety of conditions, but may not have the knowledge on how to present and market that skill.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Doctor Genius knows how to present and organize content in an effective manner for better results.\r\n\r\n<h3>Presenting material effectively</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-618\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> The 2017 State of Inbound report finds that the top challenge for 63 percent of marketers is generating traffic and leads.</p></div>\r\n\r\nA website with too much information will make it difficult for people to navigate a medical professional’s website.

With better thoughts of feeling the sand between one’s toes at the beach, going on vacation, relaxing at home, playing video games and spending time with friends outside of school, children do not even consider the idea of visiting the dentist unless they absolutely have to. However, before school starts up, late summer is the perfect time for parents to bring their child to the dentist. Dentists and other medical professionals need to be ready.\r\n<h3>Catch the wave and bring in more patients</h3>\r\nWith any type of medical practice, summer can easily become the busiest season of the year, especially in the end of July and throughout August, when school is fast approaching. Parents are desperate to get their children in for an appointment before school starts back up and schedules become more complex with a large variety of extracurricular activities.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, finds that students lose more than 51 million hours of school each year to oral diseases and other dental-related illnesses. Dentists have an excellent opportunity to provide the necessary checkup and professional cleaning a child needs to remain healthy.\r\n\r\nBy displaying a professional practice in such a way to showcase how parents can prevent their child from missing school and keep their child healthy, a dental practice will be able to begin bringing in more clients. At Doctor Genius, we can:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Create a call-tracking system to help schedule new patients</li>\r\n \t<li>Give the client a website that helps the practice stand out in the digital market</li>\r\n \t<li>Help the client showcase the best qualities of their practice to potential patients</li>\r\n \t<li>Help clients maintain a constant flow of patients throughout the year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEven if the practice presents the benefits of summer appointments on a website, it is in the style and details of the presentation that will truly help a practice stand out.\r\n<h3>Don’t miss out on this opportunity</h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-619\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<div style=\"width: 300px; border-left: 3px solid #666666; margin-center: 1px; padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n\r\nIn fact, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, finds that students lose more than 51 million hours of school each year to oral diseases and other dental-related illnesses.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we have the tools and technology to help you showcase your practice and build a strong digital presence online. With summer in full swing and school quickly approaching, do not miss out on the opportunity to bring in more patients and reach greater levels of success.\r\n\r\nWhile bringing in new patients is great for a medical practice, retaining patients is another crucial step. Doctor Genius can also utilize specific strategies to help with patient retention and generate a healthy annual flow of patients. We know how to target specific patients, such as parents searching for a dentist or other medical practice to help give their kid that checkup before school starts.

In order for a client to order the product, contact customer service, inter-office communication, schedule an appointment, you need a phone number. For a professional medical practice, having a call tracking number helps with much more than just scheduling appointments. People are more likely to click call a tracking number online than email the professional.\r\n\r\n<h3>More than just a means of tracking the number of calls</h3>\r\n\r\nIn a 2014 study by Google, the results show that 78 percent of consumers think the local address in an ad is important and 77 percent think displaying a phone number is important. Possible patients want to feel they are contacting a service that will not cheat them out of quality. If patients find it difficult to contact a practice, then they will be more inclined to seek services elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe can help professionals utilize what are known as “trust signals” such as a phone number, address, online reviews and more to help show patients that the practice is real and trustworthy. However, a medical professional may not enjoy the idea of having his or her personal phone as a main point of contact for patients. A call tracking number will be available for future patients and will help to track calls.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p>In the same Google study, 70 percent of participants prefer a call button on a website when using their smartphone.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nIt is important to listen to what consumers enjoy or find easiest to use in communication.
