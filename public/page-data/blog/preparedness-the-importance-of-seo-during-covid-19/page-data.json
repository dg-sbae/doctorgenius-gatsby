It has altered the way many<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted all aspects of our lives. It has altered the way many practices can reach their patients and pushed states to adopt new safety guidelines. While managing your business from home, it&#8217;s essential to know which mediums are still accessible to reach your clientele. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With more people at home, more web searches are happening than before lockdowns went into effect. Many of the businesses that will thrive during this downturn will be the ones who invest in search engine marketing (SEO). While other businesses go dark, an increase in web presence can make you a more prominent voice of authority for organic search. This is especially pertinent for practices vying for local ranking. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Importance of search engine marketing during COVID-19</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Here are four reasons that you should step up your SEO campaigns during this global pandemic:</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">1. SEO brings in customers who are ready to spend</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Having cash flow can be the difference-maker that helps a business survive during tough times. SEO campaigns generate a better return on investment than other marketing techniques. Unlike more general marketing, which may target people by region, search has the power to link a searcher&#8217;s need to their desired service. As </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/on-site-seo-factors/295357/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Search Engine Journal Points out</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, consistent posting, allowing more services online, and designing a user-friendly website will help your online business space overcome changes to Google&#8217;s algorithm. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Since businesses have to operate differently due to COVID-19, Google now permits virtual consultations as a </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/9798848?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GMB listing for telehealth</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> providers.

Scarcity leads to more online searches</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">An increased number of people staying at home means that there will be more people online searching for the things they need. Household items that were once easy to find have virtually disappeared from store shelves. Ranking search terms for any of these hard-to-find products, like toilet paper and hand sanitizer, is a traffic gold mine.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Businesses can also take advantage of the scarcity by ranking for alternatives to these products. This will also lead to a significant increase in traffic during these uncertain times.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3. Search engine traffic can be measured and tracked</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is little guesswork involved when running SEO campaigns. A business&#8217;s analytics gives them detailed information about their users, their behaviors, and the keywords that brought them to their website. It allows owners and managers to tweak their search engine marketing efforts as needed and increase their ROI. Search engine metrics can also help identify poor copy that does not convert. When times are hard, businesses should focus on marketing efforts that can be easily tracked and adjusted.

Things will eventually get back to normal</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While COVID-19 has caused panic globally, it is unlikely to change the way the world works significantly. SEO marketing will continue to be an effective way to reach customers, and businesses that increased their traffic by adapting to the changes the pandemic caused will be better positioned when things get back to normal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even though paid SEO campaigns can lead to positive results in a short amount of time, ranking for hot keywords in your industry takes time. Prime your business to be a winner by getting ahead of your search engine marketing needs and using SEO to generate additional revenue during this pandemic. It is important to follow the trends as </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">online habits are changing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> with more people at home. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SEO Made Easy</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you are looking for a professional&#8217;s understanding of how to boost rankings for your website, we have teams trained in ranking practices online.

It is also an economic crisis, with<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/new-irs-guidelines-from-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Businesses and individuals have realized that COVID-19 is more than a health crisis. It is also an economic crisis, with people and businesses around the country feeling the sting of lost wages and revenue. The IRS has stepped in to lessen the pain by providing some guidelines for individuals and businesses. These new guidelines will help Americans find steady footing during these uncertain times.</p>\r\n<h2>COVID-19 and tax guidelines</h2>\r\n<p>Most people are aware that the IRS extended the deadline to file taxes to July 15, 2020. What many do not realize is that this is just the tip of the iceberg regarding IRS guidelines for the coronavirus pandemic. The IRS is making it easier for employers to pay employees, even those who cannot go to work due to COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the IRS has relaxed guidelines for those who need to take money out of retirement accounts. Learn more about how these guidelines impact individuals and businesses.</p>\r\n<h3>Employee retention credit</h3>\r\n<p>The Employee Retention Credit is one of the IRS’s most exciting offerings. Businesses of all sizes can apply for this credit. In order to qualify, businesses must meet one of two criteria. First, this credit is available to companies that have suspended by a government order as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, businesses with gross receipts that total less than 50% of what they were in the same quarter of the previous year are eligible.</p>\r\n<p>Companies can be eligible for a credit that is 50% of the qualifying wages, which are capped at $10,000. Employees can include the amount they pay in health care when applying for this tax credit. Once approved, employers can reduce employment tax deposits as a method of reimbursement. If employment taxes do not cover the full credit, the IRS can send direct payments. Then, companies can use the money to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<h3>Paid sick leave refundable credit</h3>\r\n<p>Employees who are sick need to stay home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The IRS has announced a paid sick leave refundable credit to ease the burden on employees and employers. Employees who cannot work due to COVID-19 can receive up to 80 hours of paid sick leave, and the employer receives a fully refundable tax credit. The IRS states that the tax credit also covers the Medicare tax and health care expenses the employer has paid.</p>\r\n<h3>Paid family leave refundable credit</h3>\r\n<p>With schools and childcare facilities shut down, parents are having a hard time getting to work. The IRS announced a paid family leave refundable credit for those who have to care for their children. Employees can take up to 10 weeks of paid family leave, and the employer receives a refundable tax credit. The credit includes health care expenses and the Medicare tax.</p>\r\n<h3>Early withdrawal penalty waived</h3>\r\n<p>Hopefully, people will not have to reach into retirement accounts for money during the coronavirus pandemic. Still, those who have been impacted by COVID-19 can withdraw up to $100,000 without paying the 10% early withdrawal fee. Taxpayers must claim the distribution when filing taxes. They can spread out over three years to avoid paying the full tax obligation at once. Also, those who pay the distribution back within three years will receive a refund on any taxes paid.</p>\r\n<h2>Let the system help you during the COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Worrying about your health and your finances is overwhelming. Fortunately, you do have some financial options to soften the blow of COVID-19. If your company is eligible for a tax credit, take advantage of it. These credits can help businesses stay afloat during this difficult time.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Now more than ever, medical practices need to find an effective way to reach patients in homes that will need treatment. It is possible to start rebounding now so your practice will be stronger than ever.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some tips to position your practice as a local leader during and after the pandemic.</p>\r\n<h2>Three ways to thrive during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Even when the pandemic reaches its peak, there will be a need for local practices. Local practices are the backbone of communities and can thrive by adapting to the new normal. This includes embracing technology and increasing the commitment to health standards.</p>\r\n<p>Practices also need to connect with clients via social media and online. Offices that do these three things can be industry leaders well before the pandemic is under control.</p>\r\n<h3>Embrace technology</h3>\r\n<p>Right now, big tech is in the position to come out ahead when the coronavirus pandemic comes to an end. With most Americans engaged in strict social distancing, people are more reliant on technology than ever before. While big tech might take the lead, businesses of all types can rebound by embracing technology. This will help businesses today and well after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>\r\n<p>The medical community is already doing this. Physicians now see large numbers of patients via video chat and phone calls. Even dentists have joined in, using teledentistry to evaluate patients and give second opinions. Businesses that use technology will rebound during the COVID-19 crisis and be on solid footing when it ends.</p>\r\n<h3>Show a commitment to health standards</h3>\r\n<p>People are afraid right now, and that fear will not disappear after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Businesses can start rebounding now by reaching out to clients and telling them what they are doing to prevent the spread of the disease. Also, these businesses should explain that these standards are not just in place for the pandemic. The health of patients is always a priority.</p>\r\n<h3>Stay connected with social media</h3>\r\n<p>Brands like Instacart and Dial have increased social media spend during COVID-19, and that makes sense. Both brands appeal to consumers during this crisis. Still, all businesses can benefit from being active on social media during this time. People spend more time online right now, and social media marketing is a good way to reach customers.</p>\r\n<p>Many people turn to local practices for information regarding COVID-19. Dentists, physicians, and others can use social media to get messages out to the public at large. This can include information about the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve. Doctors and dentists can also use the channel to help people take preventative measures for their physical and oral health.</p>\r\n<p>These practices can also help lighten the mood on social media. With so much frightening information, funny memes can help followers relax. The key is to find the sweet spot between informative and entertaining posts. Practices do not want to make the mistake of always providing humor when followers also need guidance.</p>\r\n<h2>Start rebounding today</h2>\r\n<p>With a vaccine for COVID-19 months away, you cannot wait until the pandemic is over to get to work. If you wait too long, you will have a hard time rebounding. Between technology, a commitment to health, and an online presence, you will stay on people’s minds during this crisis. You can continue to see patients and build loyalty that will last well beyond the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
