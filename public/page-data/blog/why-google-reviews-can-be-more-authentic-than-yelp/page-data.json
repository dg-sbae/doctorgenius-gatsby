If you are looking to increase<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/why-google-reviews-can-be-more-authentic-than-yelp/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The number of reviews on Google far surpasses those on other local review sites. If you are looking to increase your practice&#8217;s online reviews to appeal to more patients, it is better to focus on Google reviews over Yelp reviews. Here are some reasons to concentrate your efforts on Google reviews.</p>\r\n<h2>A Better Way To Promote a Practice</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571\">BrightLocal</a>, Google reviews can be the way to go when looking to improve SEO ranking. Using the right review platform can make marketing efforts as productive as possible. Reports from <a href=\"https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/\">ReviewTrackers</a> show 63.6% of people check Google reviews before choosing a business to visit. Putting more time into increasing reviews on other platforms may not receive a favorable investment return. As the average star rating on Google is notably higher than on Yelp, a business is more likely to benefit from a higher rating on Google than Yelp. </p>\r\n<h3>Avoid the Negative Impact of Yelp</h3>\r\n<p>The ReviewTrackers report also notes that most people use filters when searching to eliminate any business with less than a four-star rating. Yelp may exclude one&#8217;s practice from search results before even being viewed since it has a lower average rating. In this case, the practice will be affected by a lack of visibility.</p>\r\n<h3>Encourage Patients To Leave Google Reviews</h3>\r\n<p>While not all reviewers will use Google, it can be beneficial to encourage patients to review one&#8217;s practice on the desired platform. Rather than use vague language when asking for a review, mention Google specifically. Most people tend to follow directions, and because Google is a widely popular platform as well as user-friendly, it should be simple for patients to leave a review on Google.</p>\r\n<h3>Add a Direct Link</h3>\r\n<p>Another tip is to add a website link that leads directly to the Google review form. This addition will make it easier for patients to leave reviews on that site instead of having to pull one up by themselves. Many practices send patients an email after treatment or procedures to ensure they are recovering well and are not experiencing any unexpected side effects. Asking specifically for a Google review and adding a direct link in this type of email can remind patients who may have forgotten to leave a Google review.</p>\r\n<h2>Draw Patients in With Positive Reviews</h2>\r\n<p>Our team at Doctor Genius knows how important it is to get good online reviews.

It requires planning and money to build a medical practice from the ground up. Getting the financing to start is a crucial element as, according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/05/10/how-to-set-your-medical-practice-up-for-financial-success/?sh=4cbd0032b1d9\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/05/10/how-to-set-your-medical-practice-up-for-financial-success/?sh=4cbd0032b1d9\">Forbes.com</a>, there are many factors to consider. There are various ways to secure the capital needed for starting a medical practice. At Doctor Genius, we want to see your practice become a reality. Find out the basic ins and outs of a medical practice loan to get things going in the right direction.</p>\r\n<h2>The basics of a medical practice loan</h2>\r\n<p>When a provider comes requesting financing, banks want to know about the practice. As a startup, there are no records or statements to supply. Thus, when seeking a loan, you must provide copies of your business plan, financial projections, and insight into how well similar practices perform in the area. Depending on your age and the state of your personal accounts, you may need a co-signer or someone with solid finances to back a traditional loan application.</p>\r\n<h2>Types of loans for medical practices</h2>\r\n<p>As a medical practitioner, you may find there are more types of loans available for you than the lending options for traditional businesses.</p>\r\n<h3>Equipment leasing</h3>\r\n<p>Opening a medical practice often requires expensive and advanced equipment. Purchasing these items outright may not make much sense because the technology is always evolving and <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/\">newer models are introduced frequently</a>. You may want to instead take a look at leasing the equipment you need. Finance companies and equipment retailers may have contracts that allow medical practices to rent any piece of equipment needed. At the end of the lease term, you may choose to purchase the items or lease new models.</p>\r\n<h3>Line of credit</h3>\r\n<p>There are times when the practice may need access to cash quickly. A business line of credit may prove the best option. This financing option allows you open access to a set amount of funds. You use what you need when you need it. Otherwise, the available balance remains accessible only when it is needed. This type of loan can provide peace of mind for emergency situations.</p>\r\n<h3>Short-term business loan</h3>\r\n<p>A short-term business loan is one of the easiest ways you can get cash for your practice. Many lenders have online portals and can provide approval in a short time. These loans are typically best for situational purchases. The information required to get this type of loan is minimal and the money usually is provided quickly. The repayment terms can range from three months to three years, with payments typically auto-debited from your business account.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help calculate costs</h2>\r\n<p>Do not let the worry about securing a medical practice loan overcome the prospect of starting your own business. With so many financing options available, you can surely find something that fits your needs. Keep in mind that there are other requirements for creating a successful business and financial forecast.

According to Solution Reach, <a href=\"https://www.solutionreach.com/infographics/6-ways-to-retain-your-patients\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.solutionreach.com/infographics/6-ways-to-retain-your-patients\">patient attrition rates hover between 10% and 30%,</a> on average. However, research shows that making patient retention an integral part of practice management can reduce attrition rates by as much as 70%. If patient retention is not among your practice&#8217;s top priorities, it should be. Read why patient retention is so important and learn some strategies that you can use to improve it.</p>\r\n<h2>Focusing on Patient Satisfaction</h2>\r\n<p>According to the data, 70% of patients leave a practice because of the practice&#8217;s indifference. That means that only 30% of patients leave because of uncontrollable factors like job loss, income reduction, relocation, and other major life events. This information shows that one of the best ways to raise retention rates is to create a better patient experience.</p>\r\n<p>Keeping patients happy by making them feel valued can improve retention. Some ways to do this are treating patients as partners in their healthcare journey and using compassionate bedside manners when interacting with them. Keeping patients informed and following up with them after an appointment can also result in better patient experiences and retention rates.</p>\r\n<h3>Lowering Wait Times</h3>\r\n<p>Patient satisfaction is also affected by the wait time. Medical practitioners with wait times around 60 minutes received an average satisfaction score of 53 from patients. However, those whose wait times no longer than 10 minutes had average satisfaction scores of 77. For every 10 minutes of additional wait time, scores dropped between six and 10 points. Try to keep the office running as smoothly and efficiently as possible to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction.</p>\r\n<h3>Making Healthcare Convenient</h3>\r\n<p>Younger generations value convenience across all aspects of their lives, including healthcare. Convenience is among their top five priorities. Here are some elements of convenient healthcare:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Ability to get test results without seeing a doctor</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Ability to view health information in one place</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Convenient location and hours</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Convenient scheduling</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Easy check-in</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Online bill pay</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Online registration</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Wait time visibility</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Offices that are not doing any of the above may want to update their processes.</p>\r\n<h3>Asking for Feedback</h3>\r\n<p>A practice can not know how its patients feel unless they ask. <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-location-for-feedback-can-solve-management-problems/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-location-for-feedback-can-solve-management-problems/\">Incorporate ways to solicit feedback</a> from patients, both in-office and online.
