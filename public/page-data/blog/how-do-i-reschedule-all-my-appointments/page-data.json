You understand the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve. Still, you worry about finances. You need a full schedule to generate revenue, so rescheduling your appointments is critical. Here are a few rescheduling tips to help your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Tips for rescheduling appointments during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Communication is key to filling waiting rooms once the crisis is over. Health care providers know that shelter-in-place orders could continue for months. Some even expect it could last until 2021 when a possible vaccine may finally be ready. Providers should connect with patients, so they understand what to expect during this time.</p>\r\n<p>Also, this call will help ensure patients return for the rescheduled appointment. The provider can answer any questions patients may have.</p>\r\n<h3>Prioritize based on the needs of the patients</h3>\r\n<p>Health care providers should prioritize patients when rescheduling appointments. Patients who are at the highest risk should get priority when rescheduling. Providers should stay in frequent contact with these patients, providing updates on when it will be possible to see them again. Maintaining contact shows the patients that their health is a priority for the practice. This provides an incentive to reschedule.</p>\r\n<h3>Make rescheduling easy</h3>\r\n<p>Even before COVID-19, most patients prefer scheduling appointments online. Practices can expect to see a spike in rescheduled appointments with online scheduling. The fear of the unknown makes it difficult for patients to know when it is okay to go to a provider. By providing online scheduling, patients can fill those slots when they feel comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>This also lessens the burden on the staff. Staff members are already bogged down with phone calls. Allowing patients to reschedule online allows members to talk to those who need it most. This takes the stress off the staff members’ shoulders. It also makes it easier to keep a full schedule. Patients, employees, and business owners win with this strategy.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider telehealth</h3>\r\n<p>Telehealth and teledentistry have come into vogue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology allows providers to manage basic conditions and offer preventative care. These appointments tend to take less time for both the patient and the provider and are more affordable. They can also take place over the computer or phone. This form of appointment limits in-person visits.</p>\r\n<p>If possible, providers should rely on telehealth to manage some of the burdens. Filling the schedule with telehealth appointments makes it easier to meet the demands of the patients. Providers who use this can begin seeing patients now. These providers do not have to wait until the crisis is over. Also, providers can maintain appointments with telehealth even after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep the books full during and after the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>It is normal to feel worried about the state of your practice during a pandemic. Canceled appointments hurt your bottom line. You need to reschedule those missed opportunities. Fortunately, you can fill your schedule. Communicate with your patients, give priority to those who are at the highest risk, and make it easy for people to reschedule. Also, you can rely on telehealth so you can catch up on rescheduled appointments quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

The global pandemic continues to claim more lives as each day passes, and it has disrupted manufacturing and businesses in ways we have never seen before. Many businesses have been slowed down to a halt, while others have to reduce their hours of operation.</p>\r\n<p>Without a doubt, this pandemic will bring significant changes to our lives, as it proves how unprepared the world is for such events. COVID-19 brings the apocalypse for many businesses, but others will be able to use the disruption to their advantage.</p>\r\n<h2>Marketing in a world with COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Figuring out the right ways to market a business might seem like rocket science. Still, the fundamentals of digital marketing can help your business make it through the current economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Here are simple things you can do to ensure that people can find your business online:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Social media marketing</h3>\r\n<p>Social media is where billions of people all over the globe connect on online platforms. Social media marketing might seem intimidating if it is not something you use personally, but many of these platforms are easy to figure out. If you are one of those people who have a hard time navigating the internet, take online classes to familiarize yourself with the social media platform you plan to use or hire a social media manager.</p>\r\n<p>Think of social media as a place you can share your thoughts, products, and services. Consistently post information that provides value, and your following will grow. A huge following allows you to send information about your business to a large number of people in a matter of seconds. You can also use direct messages to market products and services or network with other business owners who might have helpful information.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Create videos</h3>\r\n<p>Video marketing is another great way to market your business. Business owners can do this by making video tutorials targeting keywords relevant to their business. For example, a dentist who runs their practice can create step-by-step tutorials on the proper way to floss. People looking to improve their flossing technique enter keywords into a search engine. The tutorial created by the dentist pops up, and the patient gets the information they need from a credible source. YouTube is a great place to start with marketing videos.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Create a blog with a focus on search engine optimization</h3>\r\n<p>A web-blog also helps you reach a wider audience. Many business owners are hesitant to start one because they feel that the many other pages online will drown theirs out, but that only happens when you do not include search engine optimization as part of your marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<p>A good SEO strategy allows you to drive organic traffic to your blog. There are no limits to how much traffic a business can bring in using SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>The fundamentals will get you past COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Stick to the fundaments of digital marketing, and your business will be more likely to survive the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Call or email Doctor Genius to learn more about how we can help you to keep your business running while the world deals with COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p><em>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Practices across the country have reduced the hours or shut<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-get-back-to-the-market-after-covid-19-what-to-know/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a crisis like no other. Practices across the country have reduced the hours or shut their doors completely, leaving providers wondering what to do when the pandemic is over. What steps need to be taken to jump back in and see patients again? While it might seem impossible to hit the ground running, you can do just that with a little preparation.</p>\r\n<h2>Steps to keep schedules full after the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>It could take months or even a year before life is back to normal. When that happens, patients will be ready to go to local practices. Practices that take the steps necessary to get up and to run quickly will enjoy an influx of patients. Many will even have stronger practices than ever before.</p>\r\n<h3>Get financial help</h3>\r\n<p>While some practices are closed, others are still open but offer fewer services. In both cases, practices have fewer financial resources available. It is hard to get up and running without any capital, so practices are encouraged to use the available financial resources to put cash into the business. The federal government is currently offering a Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, including medical and dental practices, keep employees on the payroll. Keeping employees on the payroll will make it easier to run on all cylinders when the pandemic is over.</p>\r\n<p>The federal government is offering other financial options for practices that have taken a financial hit during the COVID-19 pandemic. These options include loan advances, bridge loans, and debt relief. Practices can use these resources to stay financially healthy during the pandemic. Then, when the pandemic is under control, practices will be ready to get back to work.</p>\r\n<h3>Expand hours when reopening</h3>\r\n<p>There will be a massive demand for health care providers and dentists when Americans are no longer required to engage in social distancing. Practices are encouraged to expand their hours to meet the demand. Those who do this are more likely to get a larger portion of the patients. If possible, practices should also consider working on weekends until the demand begins to die down. This can help practices generate revenue in the first several months after the pandemic ends.</p>\r\n<h3>Broadcast sterilization techniques</h3>\r\n<p>The aftermath of the pandemic will likely include psychological changes. Americans will be more fearful of germs and viruses. Practices that want to attract patients will need to make sterilization strategies part of their business models. Simply cleaning more often is not enough. Practices need to communicate what they are doing to the patients. Those who go the extra mile are more likely to generate business.</p>\r\n<h2>Get ready to restart your practice</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has changed the way you do business. It might seem like there is no end in sight, but eventually, the pandemic will be contained, and you will go back to business as normal. For that to happen, however, you need to take steps to prepare. Get the financial help you need during the pandemic. Then, consider expanding your hours and adopt sterilization techniques so your patients will not worry about getting sick. Then, you can treat patients like you did before COVID-19 took over.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
