While this concept works in all areas of business and personal growth, many medical and dental practices have particularly enjoyed success using Kaizen. The key is to implement strategies that inspire teams. When everyone is inspired and involved, those small improvements add up and create a healthy practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Kaizen strategies to inspire teams</h2>\r\n<p>Employees should be at the heart of a practice’s Kaizen strategy. This goes beyond the top of the chain employees. Everyone, including janitors and support staff, is needed for this strategy to work. Once everyone is involved, employees will feel inspired. To ensure inspiration, employers must train employees, empower them, and measure the results.</p>\r\n<h3>Train employees on Kaizen</h3>\r\n<p>Before a practice can implement Kaizen strategies, it must ensure that employees fully understand it. All employees must receive training on Kaizen. The strategies are simple and include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Improvements with small, incremental changes</li>\r\n\t<li>The ideas come from the employees</li>\r\n\t<li>Feedback for all changes</li>\r\n\t<li>The results are measurable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Practices should train all current employees. Also, new employees should be trained on Kaizen when hired. Once everyone is on the same page, it is time to implement the strategies. Then, the practice can make small improvements and inspire employees.</p>\r\n<h3>Empower employees and teams</h3>\r\n<p>To truly inspire, practices must empower employees. All employees should be encouraged to share ideas to improve their positions. Employees give suggestions to supervisors, who then empower them to implement the change immediately. This gives employees the freedom to make meaningful changes in the workplace.</p>\r\n<p>Practices should also encourage teams to work together to brainstorm ideas for changes. When working in teams, it is common to have several solutions. The team should select one of the ideas and start with it. Then, if that idea does not provide the desired results, the team can try a different idea.</p>\r\n<h3>Measure the results</h3>\r\n<p>Kaizen works because it is measurable. Supervisors must measure the outcome after the changes are implemented. After the results are tracked, the employee meets with the supervisor to go over the results. If both agree that the results showed a positive outcome, the new practice can be standardized and enforced. It will continue to be the standard mode of practice until someone else comes up with a new way to improve the results.</p>\r\n<p>Employees cannot help but feel inspired after their ideas become standard practice. These employees are making a difference on the practice. That causes employees to work hard to come up with additional ideas as well. It is exciting to have a role in changing a practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Grow your practice with Kaizen</h2>\r\n<p>Significant changes are challenging to implement and often do not provide the results you need for your practice. With Kaizen, you can use small changes to transform your practice. You might not notice huge changes overnight, but after using Kaizen for a few months, you will start to see significant results. Possibly, more importantly, your employees will be inspired and take ownership of their positions. Use these tips to implement strategies that get your employees excited to contribute at work.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Practices across the country have reduced the hours or shut<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-get-back-to-the-market-after-covid-19-what-to-know/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a crisis like no other. Practices across the country have reduced the hours or shut their doors completely, leaving providers wondering what to do when the pandemic is over. What steps need to be taken to jump back in and see patients again? While it might seem impossible to hit the ground running, you can do just that with a little preparation.</p>\r\n<h2>Steps to keep schedules full after the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>It could take months or even a year before life is back to normal. When that happens, patients will be ready to go to local practices. Practices that take the steps necessary to get up and to run quickly will enjoy an influx of patients. Many will even have stronger practices than ever before.</p>\r\n<h3>Get financial help</h3>\r\n<p>While some practices are closed, others are still open but offer fewer services. In both cases, practices have fewer financial resources available. It is hard to get up and running without any capital, so practices are encouraged to use the available financial resources to put cash into the business. The federal government is currently offering a Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, including medical and dental practices, keep employees on the payroll. Keeping employees on the payroll will make it easier to run on all cylinders when the pandemic is over.</p>\r\n<p>The federal government is offering other financial options for practices that have taken a financial hit during the COVID-19 pandemic. These options include loan advances, bridge loans, and debt relief. Practices can use these resources to stay financially healthy during the pandemic. Then, when the pandemic is under control, practices will be ready to get back to work.</p>\r\n<h3>Expand hours when reopening</h3>\r\n<p>There will be a massive demand for health care providers and dentists when Americans are no longer required to engage in social distancing. Practices are encouraged to expand their hours to meet the demand. Those who do this are more likely to get a larger portion of the patients. If possible, practices should also consider working on weekends until the demand begins to die down. This can help practices generate revenue in the first several months after the pandemic ends.</p>\r\n<h3>Broadcast sterilization techniques</h3>\r\n<p>The aftermath of the pandemic will likely include psychological changes. Americans will be more fearful of germs and viruses. Practices that want to attract patients will need to make sterilization strategies part of their business models. Simply cleaning more often is not enough. Practices need to communicate what they are doing to the patients. Those who go the extra mile are more likely to generate business.</p>\r\n<h2>Get ready to restart your practice</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has changed the way you do business. It might seem like there is no end in sight, but eventually, the pandemic will be contained, and you will go back to business as normal. For that to happen, however, you need to take steps to prepare. Get the financial help you need during the pandemic. Then, consider expanding your hours and adopt sterilization techniques so your patients will not worry about getting sick. Then, you can treat patients like you did before COVID-19 took over.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Whether some practices continue to provide some emergency services during the quarantine or had to close their doors, there are various factors that they will need to know before reopening fully. Thus Doctor Genius is working with NextLevel Practice CEO Gary Kadi to introduce the Practice Recovery Blueprint.</p>\r\n<h3>The Solution You Need in One Place</h3>\r\n<p>As we enter the third month in quarantine, state governments are laying out plans to allow more businesses to reopen with modest new operational guidelines. Professional medical practices of all professions are attempting to determine the next steps for reopening. In a recent webinar session in the series &#8220;Certainty in an Uncertain World,&#8221; Doctor Genius&#8217;s Vice President Phil Lopez and Gary Kadi, join others in breaking down what the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius-1.wistia.com/medias/5yv90rvx3c\" target=\" _blank\">Practice Recovery Blueprint</a> includes for medical professionals and why it is so important.</p>\r\n<p>During the appointment, Phil Lopez and Gary Kadi, list off questions and factors that dentists and other medical professionals need to focus on. Lopez elaborates on the partnership with NextLevel Practice to create &#8220;…an all-inclusive solution that meets the needs of your practice,&#8221; also highlighting that &#8220;Our partnership provides the resources that improve your organization&#8217;s operations and empower teams to create a one-of-a-kind experience for patients.&#8221; This partnership can help our clients determine what they will need to reopen and provide the quality services patients need.</p>\r\n<h3>Following the Search Results</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we are constantly monitoring the search results of our content to determine what services patients are searching for. While there was a dip in search results during the earlier weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now seeing an increase in specific search terms.</p>\r\n<p>The actual change in organic traffic growth for dental practices since stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns, went into effect is represented in the graph below. Organic traffic growth is defined as the growth of visitors who found a website through search inquires alone. As can be seen from the graph below, the number of searches by users is growing each week. When we cross-compared these numbers to yearly averages for late March and all of April for other years, we found this growth in visitors to be atypical. In other words, the data is showing that patients have a growing demand to seek out dentists during the COVID-19 crisis. Numerically, there are about 7% more patients visiting dental sites each week from organic search.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2140\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3.png\" alt=\"Growth in Organic Traffic Since Lockdown for Dental\" width=\"549\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3.png 549w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3-300x166.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3-177x98.png 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" /></p>\r\n<p>Common search terms we see include &#8220;dentist near me,&#8221; &#8220;emergency dentist,&#8221; &#8220;teledentistry,&#8221; and other questions such as &#8220;Can you put a tooth back in your mouth?,&#8221; &#8220;Is a tooth abscess considered a dental emergency?,&#8221; or &#8220;What do you do with a toothache on the weekends?&#8221; to name a few. People are currently in need of treatment and will be once the quarantine lifts. While at this moment, most online inquires show spikes in emergency care needs, we’re also seeing new searches. To prepare for what searches may be relevant going into June and beyond, you may read further into <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/\">our article on changing habits</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Dental practices need to be prepared to provide all of the services patients need. Many of the practices we serve are reporting an increase in customer activity as patients want to put this stall in their work-lives toward staying healthy. Visit <a href=\"https://recoverygenius.nextlevelpractice.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Practice Recovery Blueprint</a> to learn more about how to prepare and reopen with a strong foot forward.</p>\r\n<h3>Starting with The Right Blueprints</h3>\r\n<p>When it comes to providing dentistry in a post-COVID world, dentists will need to consider various factors for providing treatment. Doctor Genius and NextLevel Practice can help dentists find the solutions they need by considering several factors such as:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n\t<li>Implementing new sanitation measures for office staff, guests in the waiting room, and the dental chair</li>\r\n\t<li>Frequency of scheduling appointments</li>\r\n\t<li>Language and message front desk staff members use when communicating with patients over the phone</li>\r\n\t<li>Anticipating specific services online that patients need</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Given how quickly regulations and stay-at-home orders can change under quarantine, Doctor Genius is here to help with short term fixes for sudden issues, which can lead to long term solutions. We will customize the plan to an individual practice&#8217;s needs with relevant content, teledentistry services (to be announced), and specific return-to-work plans. Follow us <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> to see weekly updates in the changing regulations of dental practices and for articles on practice management.</p>\r\n<h3>We Are Here to Help</h3>\r\n<p>If you are unsure of how to help your dental or medical practice back on track and prepare to reopen, reach out to us.
