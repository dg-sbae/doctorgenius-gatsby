Social media is becoming an effective tool for professionals of any field to reach clients.  However, professionals need the social media know-how to navigate the system and gain more patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A strong presence in social media</h3>\r\nFrom Pinterest to Twitter, dental professionals are able to interact with patients and share information about their services online. Social media can give professionals an opportunity to offer their services, promotions and information to potential patients with the click of a button. Twitter is one such platform that allows for quick bits of information.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, the PEW Research Center found in a group of 1,520 adults, 79 percent used Facebook as their main social media platform. Meanwhile, CNN writes on money.cnn.com that Facebook is climbing toward 2 billion active users as of the end of 2016. With the variety of content that people post on any social media platform, there are a variety of tools that people use online. One such tool is known as the hashtag that helps people find the post more easily than before.\r\n\r\nIn another study of the PEW Research Center, they explain that “The hashtag symbol (#) is used before keywords to categorize tweets and helps facilitate searches within Twitter.” By using the hashtag symbol, professionals can help patients find a specific post about dental care. Examples can include #DentalCheckups or #ProfessionalTeethCleaning. The PEW Research Center also finds that “Clicking on a hashtag will show all the tweets in a category.”\r\n\r\nTwitter is beneficial for a quick and small post that appeals to patients who do not need or want a lot of information. However, attaching any word to a hashtag symbol does not guarantee that more people will read the post.\r\n<h3>Let Doctor Genius enhance your practice</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-548\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we understand the mechanics of social media, utilizing Facebook and Twitter to promote a client’s practice. While Facebook is extremely popular, people will frequent other platforms online for various reasons. The PEW Research Center also found that in 2011, around 57 percent of all tweets from The Daily Caller and 21 percent of all tweets from the Washington Post used the hashtag symbol.\r\n\r\nWhile the hashtag symbol can be effective, we will not flood every single tweet, Facebook post or comment with hashtags. We have a team of professionals who can help create, customize and continually monitor online content to ensure that our clients get quality service. Social media has more tools and methods for promoting one’s practice to potential patients. We strive to help our clients’ Facebook pages appear on other people’s feeds, while also reaching out on Twitter.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in more information or in seeking our services, feel free to give us a call. #Specializedonlinecontent\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

In fact, a dental professional may feel something akin to déjà vu in telling patients to keep up regular dental hygiene. Patients may not realize that there are multiple reasons to work with the dental treatment and to continue visiting a dentist. Fortunately, we have the tools to help spread the word about your practice and draw in new patients by displaying a comforting atmosphere online.\r\n<h3>A guiding source of oral health care</h3>\r\nIn all forms of medicine and treatment, people who participate in their treatment find better results. Healthaffairs.org reviews data from a Health Policy Brief, stating that “A growing body of evidence demonstrates that patients who are more actively involved in their health care experience better health outcomes and incur lower costs.”\r\n\r\nMore importantly, patients are beginning to move to these locations that successfully help people achieve higher levels of health. Healthaffairs.org also states that “many public and private health care organizations are employing strategies to better engage patients, such as educating them about their conditions and involving them more fully in making decisions about their care.”\r\n\r\nTo compete, dental professionals need to have a website that engages the patient and acts as a source of information for the patient’s needs. Professionals can engage patients in a positive way before even seeing them in the office with a strong online presence. At Doctor Genius, we can help to do this by displaying important information in a positive manner.\r\n<h3>Create content that matters</h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-541\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/patient-involvement-img2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/patient-involvement-img2.png 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/patient-involvement-img2-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />We not only offer information about the client’s dental practice on the website, but we also offer tips for patients’ overall health. We create content that will help motivate patients to keep up healthy oral hygiene at home and visit the dentist on a regular basis. By creating an informative and helpful website, patients will feel better about remaining with our client instead of going elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHowever, we stress that at-home care will only accomplish so much in terms of keeping teeth healthy. On the website, we point out that the patient needs to seek your services for professional care and treatment. A dental professional can identify any signs of potential infection or disease and treat it before it spreads.\r\n\r\nWith the correct content, patients will refer to your website for information and schedule an appointment. We can help engage the patient to help them become more active in their treatment. It all begins with an effective website, which is what we can offer dental professionals. We have the tools and resources to keep a website and social media page active.
