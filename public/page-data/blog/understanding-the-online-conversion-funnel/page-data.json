The primary goal of your website is not only to get people to see it but also to get them to choose your clinic over others. Converting those views into clients takes a little more effort in this ultra-competitive business. Walking through a conversion funnel allow you to see how page views become in-person appointments by following a user&#8217;s path from website visits through conversion. Take a closer look at how content marketing can help drive traffic through the proper funnels and straight to your front door.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding the stages of the funnel</h2>\r\n<p>The term conversion funnel describes the way people go from browsing the web to becoming your clients. It maps out the path people take from curiosity to appointments to improve your website&#8217;s chances of conversions in the future. There are three basic stages to a funnel:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> This is the first interaction a potential client has with your practice. It often occurs when your website is returned as a search result to a person looking up a medical term or condition.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> At this point, the user is doing some serious perusing on your practice&#8217;s site. Blog posts created to capture the greatest interest are effective ways to pull clients from the awareness stage down into the evaluation or middle funnel. Users who spend quality time in this step are genuinely interested in the services your practice provides.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Your ultimate goal is to get this window-shopper to pick up the phone or click a link to book an appointment. Getting users to drop down into this sector takes know-how of creating content and fine-tuning search analytics to answer relevant questions and earn a certain measure of authority and respect. When a client converts, it is because something about what you presented gained a measure of trust. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Using Google Analytics to transition visitors to clients</h2>\r\n<p>To create a website that maximizes the conversion funnel, it is imperative to track a client&#8217;s journey through your page so you can fine-tune for the kind of content that leads to a higher conversion rate. Using Google Analytics can give you a better understanding of your webpage&#8217;s visitors and how they interact with your content. Breaking down the information can help you refine the way traffic is driven to and through your page.</p>\r\n<h3>Who views your page?</h3>\r\n<p>The Google Analytics page provides a wealth of insight into the type of traffic your website gets. Familiarize yourself with the users who visit your website, or rather, the data associated with them. When people conduct online searches, their IP address is recorded in Google. That address allows Google to track their activity online, including any visits to your website. Google Analytics can generate a report telling you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The average times the same IP address has visited your site</li>\r\n\t<li>The amount of time the user spends engaged with your content</li>\r\n\t<li>The pages visited on your site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Understanding this information can allow you to see if the content you create correlates to repeat visits from users. By tracking user engagement, you can see how many visitors convert to in-house appointments.</p>\r\n<h3>What content gets the most traffic?</h3>\r\n<p>In the past, healthcare practices relied solely on word of mouth to gain new clients. This most often came in the form of friends or family recommending a practice to someone new. However, the internet not only allows clients to find their own providers but also allows you the opportunity to attract people you would not have gotten otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>The content you create can make or break your ability to funnel new users into becoming clients. By analyzing the page hits and time spent on your site, you can make changes to not only the way you present information, but the type of information visitors to your website are most interested in seeing. You may see a pattern emerge that takes your practice&#8217;s web presence in a different direction. For example, if you focus mostly on product awareness but see that users to your site tend to spend the most time reading about signs and symptoms of conditions, then you may want to create more content centered around this.</p>\r\n<h3>What is the bounce rate?</h3>\r\n<p>Your practice&#8217;s website probably has multiple layers and pages to offer the greatest chance that users would remain on a page and eventually schedule an appointment. When looking at Google Analytics, you may notice something called the bounce rate. As explained by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/10/30/seven-google-analytics-metrics-you-need-to-track-to-grow-your-business/#1c66e6fb6180\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/10/30/seven-google-analytics-metrics-you-need-to-track-to-grow-your-business/#1c66e6fb6180\">Forbes.com</a>, this number indicates how often someone opened a single page on your website and then left.</p>\r\n<p>There is no further data available to track these users because they failed to engage with your webpage beyond that single hit. This may be someone who followed a Google search result, such as a featured snippet, to your page, and then closed it without going any further through. A fairly high bounce rate is not necessarily a bad thing unless you notice that certain pages seem to encourage users to leave your site.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, if your homepage gets a high number of quick visits, then there is likely something that is either broken (like a link) or not engaging enough to warrant a user&#8217;s time to investigate further. Consider making your homepage more inviting and personal. Sometimes all it can take to retain a user is to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\">add photos of your office</a> and staff at work. Sometime specific articles may have higher bounce rates, either because the subject matter is not popular or perhaps the content is confusingly presented. A bounce rate analysis can help you figure out what needs fixing to retain users on your page.</p>\r\n<h2>We can provide solutions</h2>\r\n<p>If all of this talk about conversion funnels and bounce rates has your head spinning, never fear!

Dental healthcare may seem scary<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-discuss-treatments-with-patients/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>As a dental practitioner, you understand that you may have to deal with cautious patients. Dental healthcare may seem scary to some. When it comes to speaking to patients about treatment plans, the way you present the options and recommendations is as important as the plan itself. Getting a patient to feel confident enough in your practice to follow through with treatment is critical to your practice&#8217;s financial success. Practice management can help get jittery patients to not only understand their options but also to sign up for the recommendations for overall health improvement.</p>\r\n<h2>Presenting a Treatment Plan</h2>\r\n<p>Once a consultation occurs and all issues are identified, the focus needs to shift to providing a sufficient explanation of what happens next. Your treatment recommendations likely go beyond what is medically necessary in the short term. By having a team member give a clear and concise description of the treatment plan, the patient may be more apt to continue it past the crucial first phase. Learning how to present the treatment plan and the tools your practice uses to do so are critical steps in gaining patient confidence.</p>\r\n<h3>Remain positive</h3>\r\n<p>Patients who put off dental care typically do so either out of fear or lack of finances. One way to overcome the first obstacle is by remaining upbeat during your explanation of the treatment plan. When discussing the dental issues that need fixing sooner, identify and explain the health consequences of delaying treatment. Speak compassionately and empathize with the worry patients may express. This is a good time to educate the patient on the practitioner&#8217;s credentials and how the practice provides superior care before, during, and after treatment plans. Remind patients that according to <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475\">MayoClinic.org</a>, oral health impacts other body systems and may contribute to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Heart disease</li>\r\n\t<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n\t<li>Cancer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Keep it simple</h3>\r\n<p>You use technical terms around the office, but when it comes to patient interaction, less is more. This does not mean you should speak down to patients, but modify your vocabulary to use fewer formal medical terms. Give appropriate examples and scenarios to aid in your explanation. Referring to amalgam fillings as silver is a perfectly acceptable switch that can get your message through on a level understood by the patient. Use online resources through your patient portal to illustrate procedures.</p>\r\n<h3>Present the numbers</h3>\r\n<p>Patients have budgets. When presenting treatment plans, try to have the exact costs. If you can have to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/\">estimate for insurance purposes</a>,  ensure that the patient understands the number may change. A patient will not likely continue onto suggested treatments if the requisite procedures cost far more than initially indicated. Since your practice relies on retaining patients, presenting accurate pricing goes a long way to gaining trust.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us assist you</h2>\r\n<p>Patient management is a priority for the successful growth of your practice.

While it is common for businesses to pay for someone to handle the SEO of a website, this method relies entirely on free, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\">organic strategies</a>. There are several essential components that affect how well a site is optimized for search engines:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keyword optimization: </strong>Choosing the right keywords and phrases and utilizing them effectively is the most important part of on-page SEO. This involves performing keyword research, considering placement of words, and creating content.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Backlinking:</strong> One way to efficiently boost your site’s reputation is by including backlinks to other trustworthy sources throughout your content. You should also manage any other sites that link to your page and consider disavowing any questionable sources.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Crawlability: </strong>A high-functioning backend is also important for SEO. Having a site map, ensuring the server is secure, and hosting pages that load quickly all contribute to the technical crawlability of the site.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>What is SEM?</h3>\r\n<p>Rather than rely on organic content to boost your office’s website, you can also include search engine marketing in your strategy. This practice uses paid advertisements to make a site more visible on search engines.</p>\r\n<p>SEM often refers to paid-per-click advertising, which means you are only charged for the ad if the patient clicks on it. However, like SEO, keyword research is essential for ensuring a large number of high-quality leads encounter the ad.</p>\r\n<h2>How to utilize both SEO in and SEM in a campaign</h2>\r\n<p>Most marketing campaigns benefit from using a combination of SEO and SEM. Knowing how much to use of each depends on your budget, current goals, industry, and website performance.</p>\r\n<p>For new offices with the primary goal of gaining brand awareness and visibility, SEM offers immediate results. Even if the website is not optimized, it can still gain visibility while you finetune those details. If keywords are very competitive for your industry, PPC ads make it easier to appear on the search engine ranking page than it would with SEO.</p>\r\n<p>However, SEO offers long-lasting results that are not limited by a temporary ad. For well-established brands with quality organic content and a strong website, improving SEO has notable benefits.</p>\r\n<h2>Take your marketing efforts to the next level</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand how SEM and SEO work together to make a marketing campaign successful.
