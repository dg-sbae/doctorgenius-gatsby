Until recently, many thought the on-demand economy would be a passing trend, directed toward the young and wealthy. However, recent data shows that is far from the case, with <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy\">30% of on-demand consumers</a> being between the ages of 35 and 54, and another 22% age 55 and older.</p>\r\n<p>As to be expected, the largest sector of the on-demand economy is online marketplaces. This is followed by transportation, with food and grocery coming in third. As a health care practitioner, you may assume you are not a part of this, but you would be wrong. On-demand health and beauty services account for $8.1 billion in consumer spending each year, and analysts anticipate spending will only grow with time. It is important that you adapt your content marketing strategy to accommodate this change and appeal to the on-demand market.</p>\r\n<h2>The power of listicles</h2>\r\n<p>While a strong content marketing strategy utilizes a variety of content types, consumers respond particularly well to lists and bullet points. The most popular women’s magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and Good Housekeeping have included listicles for decades.</p>\r\n<p>Listicles appeal to consumers’ need to lump things into round-numbered groups, a tendency that marketing scholars Robert M. Schindler and Mathew S. Isaac refer to as the “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1\">top 10 effect</a>.” According to the scholars, by lumping items into rounded numbered groups, such as “Top 10,” or “20 Best,” it becomes easier for consumers to process mass amounts of information quickly. Not only that, but it also helps them to make what they deem “more informed decisions” quickly.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, when a list details the “Top 10 On-Demand Health Care Services,” the 10 items within the list get particular notice. Consumers tend to consider other services that do not make the cut as “inferior.” This is true even of services that come in at number 11, even if the cause of that ranking is minimal or unknown. The impression most people get when viewing such a list is that if an item does not rank in the top 10, it is a level down.</p>\r\n<h2>What this means for your practice</h2>\r\n<p>According to Digital Journal, 30% of blog posts are lists, suggesting that you cannot go wrong with this format. In addition to aspiring to be a part of a Top 10 list by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">leveraging technology</a>, you should create lists of your own. At Doctor Genius, listicles are one of our go-to content formats for driving engagement and guiding readers through the sales cycle. On behalf of our clients, we create lists on everything from the top dental restoration procedures to ways patients can improve heart health to the benefits of clear braces.</p>\r\n<h2>Leverage listicles to boost your rankings</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we are familiar with the most effective strategies for marketing health care and dental practices online.

Among those challenges is your ability to incite trust in prospective patients, demonstrate competency of care, and encourage prospects to choose you over your competitors — all before they ever set foot in your office. While an up-to-date website, strong content, and patient reviews can go a long way toward helping you overcome several marketing challenges, original photos and detailed imagery may be just what you need to overcome the unique three.</p>\r\n<h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>\r\n<p>You can invest all your resources into beautiful web design, informative content, and strategic SEO, but without supplementing your efforts with high-quality imagery, your efforts may be for naught. According to Solve, websites that feature “good images” receive <a href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\">94% more views</a> than those without photos or with low-quality images. Moreover, substandard photos may hurt your practice more than a lack of photos, as low-grade pictures send the impression that your brand is cheap, impersonal, and untrustworthy. The right photos, however, can do the opposite and help your practice overcome challenges one, two, and three.</p>\r\n<h3>Build trust</h3>\r\n<p>Original photography is one of the best ways to build trust in prospective patients. Real images give prospects a glimpse of who you are as a provider and what type of community you have created in-office. Genuine smiles on the faces of real patients and team members help prospects feel reassured that you operate a warm, welcome, and caring environment and that people are happy to be in your care.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, before and after photos of real patients let you live up to the adage of “show, don’t tell.” It is easy enough to state on your website that you specialize in full-mouth restorations, but convincing patients that this is true requires proof. An image gallery with clearly labeled before and after photos can serve as all the evidence you need, though it cannot hurt to accompany images with patient testimonials as well.</p>\r\n<h3>Demonstrate competency of care</h3>\r\n<p>Trust and competency go hand in hand. If a prospect does not trust that you can competently manage his or her care, he or she will not choose you despite your other redeeming qualities. Use imagery to provide a comprehensive and visual overview of your services, procedures, and outcomes, such as what we did with our <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\">new Doctor Genius video</a>. If you use high-tech equipment in your practice, go beyond original photos and use videos to demonstrate how it works. Do not be afraid to play with photos and video to guide prospects through the patient journey so they know what to expect. Finally, use imagery to educate patients on your services, address common health issues, and provide tips for how patients can protect their health.</p>\r\n<h3>Differentiate your brand</h3>\r\n<p>Last but not least, original photos are an effective way to set yourself apart from the competition. Whereas many brands still rely on stock imagery, whether because of time, cost, or unawareness, you can set your brand apart by offering a wholly transparent and honest look at your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Attract more patients with tailored solutions</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we focus solely on developing comprehensive digital marketing solutions for health care professionals.

So long as providers could fulfill potential patients’ needs on those two factors alone, there was little reason for them to differentiate themselves from the competition. Today, however, that is no longer the case.</p>\r\n<h2>Web design strategies to set your practice apart from the competition</h2>\r\n<p>Today, if health care providers wish to attract new patients and keep existing ones, they must set themselves apart from the competition. While a big portion of the patient experience takes place in office, it really begins online. These digital marketing strategies can help your site stand out from the rest:</p>\r\n<h3>Play with format</h3>\r\n<p>Some types of content prove more effective than others in terms of engagement and rankings, but at Doctor Genius, we know from experience that no single type of content will appeal to every visitor. It makes sense to vary your content from time to time, even if doing so goes against the status quo for your industry. As a health care provider, you likely use long-form articles, short blog posts, original research, and case studies as the foundation of your strategy. However, you can expand your reach and grow your audience by incorporating one or more of the following formats as well:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Infographics</li>\r\n\t<li>Quizzes and polls</li>\r\n\t<li>Podcasts</li>\r\n\t<li>Webinars</li>\r\n\t<li>Email newsletters</li>\r\n\t<li>Video</li>\r\n\t<li>Health checklists</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Fill the gaps in competitors’ messaging</h3>\r\n<p>To differentiate yourself from the competition, Forbes suggests <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3\">stalking your competitors online</a>. Visit their websites, follow their blogs, like their Facebook pages, sign up for their email newsletters, and listen to their podcasts. Make note of the topics they routinely discuss and identify gaps. By either expanding on tired topics or broaching new ones, you can position yourself as an industry thought leader, an invaluable position to hold in the health or dental field.</p>\r\n<h3>Offer virtual tours</h3>\r\n<p>The health care industry has the unique challenge of helping potential patients overcome their phobias before they even schedule an appointment. One effective way to do this is through <a href=\"https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.\">virtual tours</a>. These allow potential patients to get to know every facet of your practice and to familiarize themselves with the environment before they set foot in your office. They also let you showcase special amenities you may have, such as X-ray machines, special kids’ activity areas, and recovery rooms. Live tours, especially those that contain voiceover narration, can give website visitors much-needed reassurance that you prioritize their comfort.</p>\r\n<h3>Use real photos</h3>\r\n<p>Visual elements are such an important part of any website, but not all imagery is created equal. According to findings from a Marketing Experiments study, prospective customers are <a href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested\">35% more likely to convert</a> when presented with real imagery as opposed to stock photos. While there are several reasons behind this, the takeaway is simple: Always use real photos when possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn about the PX, Patient Experience Package</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we pride ourselves on our ability to help clients build a custom branding and patient experience through digital marketing efforts.

This increases the chances that more people will read your post, which in turn increases the chances of gaining new patients. At Doctor Genius, we can help improve your content management to attract more clients. Along with using the right keywords, it is also important to understand what a salience score refers to.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding salience</h2>\r\n<p>Salience refers to the importance of a language feature within a text. In other words, the language that the writer uses in the web copy helps a search engine understand the true nature of the website. Machine learning technology helps to predict which words or concepts are deemed more important by those reading the text, and writers should strive to incorporate them.</p>\r\n<p>These days, writing content is about more than just getting leads. The content must be helpful and of high quality, which is why <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-speaking-to-a-general-audience/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-speaking-to-a-general-audience/\">tailoring the information</a> is important.  </p>\r\n<h2>How to improve the salience score</h2>\r\n<p>A salience score is what language processors assign to language and words in web copy. The higher the score, the more important it is.</p>\r\n<h3>Use entities in the copy</h3>\r\n<p>To improve the salience score and, ultimately, search ranking, Inc.com talks about how you must <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/david-amerland/a-smart-trick-to-help-your-business-rank-in-google-searches.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.inc.com/david-amerland/a-smart-trick-to-help-your-business-rank-in-google-searches.html\">include entities</a> in one way or another. Doing this causes a search engine, such as Google for example, to calculate the text differently. It may be challenging knowing what words to use, but Google does have an Application Programming Interface that writers can use to see what score the copy would be assigned. Just insert your text into the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\">API demo</a> to see if you should make any changes.</p>\r\n<h3>Position text properly</h3>\r\n<p>Readers tend to place more importance on the beginning of a sentence. To improve your salience score, make sure the topic’s focus is at the start.

However, dentists and medical professionals as a whole, need more than simple facts stated on a page. Starting out as a content writer, I strove to find the balance between providing well-researched academic information and speaking to a general audience. Writing for Doctor Genius has only improved my competence in authoring technical and patient-friendly medical content. In turn, my work and time with Doctor Genius have also enhanced our internal writing standards as I have become well-versed in what constitutes industry-best practices.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The three main areas I have learned to consider when writing for Doctor Genius are the sources or facts of the content itself, the SEO terminology, and creating comprehensible content in an easy-to-digest platform. My name is Nick Adams, and I am the Lead Editor at Doctor Genius, going on four years with the Company.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A Bit About Myself and the Content Team</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I started as a content writer at Doctor Genius in 2016, gradually working my way up to lead editor. Starting, I was the only in-house content writer. Now, as the lead editor, I mentor other writers and oversee our final product, creating greater quality control in every piece we produce. While I now focus more on editing and writing specialized content, my goal remains the same: improving our professionalism and readability standards, translating into improved client ranking, connecting more new patients to clients. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While the goal was the same, it was not easy to expand the styles and forms of content beyond what we had. After four years, I have been able to help the content department grow with the help of my manager, Alexander Hess. With his guidance, we continue to focus on quality over quantity while expanding our client’s ranking signals in authority and expertise through adding new digital assets.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One Step in the Overall Process</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Our writers’ editing process is more like a conversation, highlighting any corrections or changes to consider and sending it back to them for review. We strive to help our writers grow in their skills while also expanding their knowledge. Even after our writers complete the training, we encourage them to continue learning. When we assign a writer a custom content order, they will start researching the various keywords, the client’s medical specialty, and anything else they need to know.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even though the content department is only one part of the process, it is crucial to follow any instructions and strive for content that will help boost the client’s online presence. Once the writer finishes the content, I will review it and mark-up any changes they need to see before passing it back. After a final review, the content is ready to move on through to production for installation to the website.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- Start Author Panel -->\r\n<p>\r\n<style>\r\n    .author-panel {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-direction: row;\r\n        font-size: 1.0rem;\r\n        line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel.card {\r\n        padding: 2.5%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel p { line-height: 1.5 !important; }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel .panel-text {font-size: 14.5px !important; }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder {\r\n        width: 25%;\r\n        margin: 1% 2.5%\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder img, .author-info {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        max-width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder img {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        height: auto;\r\n        margin-bottom: 15px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info h5 {\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n        font-size: 100%;\r\n        text-decoration: underline\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info ul {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        padding-left: 0;\r\n        width: 100% !important;\r\n        justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel ul li {\r\n        list-style-type: none;\r\n        text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info li {\r\n        font-size: 75%;\r\n        font-style: italic;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .panel-text { width: 72.5%; margin-left: 2.5% }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel h5 { margin-bottom: 0)\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"author-panel card\">\r\n<div class=\"image-holder\"><img class=\"author-image alignnone wp-image-2430 size-thumbnail\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Adams - Lead Editor - Doctor Genius\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-480x480.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><br />\r\n<div class=\"author-info\">\r\n<h5>Nick Adams</h5>\r\n<!-- Uncomment these to utilize: --><!-- <ul><li><a title=\"Author page coming soon!\" disabled>Posts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\">Bio</a></li>-->\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"mailto:nadams@doctorgenius.com\">Email</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-text\">\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After graduating from Azusa Pacific University, with a BA in English-Writing Concentration, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-adams-27630344/\">Nick Adams</a> utilized his writing skills to build a professional career in writing. While at APU, Nick studied various forms and styles of writing, including journalism and technical writing. Before DG, Nick worked in other technical writing roles before shifting his focus on blogs and webpages associated with the medical field of addiction, mental health, and dual diagnosis treatment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2016, we brought Nick on as a Content Writer. Since then, Nick has written, edited, or overseen upwards of 300 separate custom content orders, written various forms of media text (blogs, video scripts, and press releases), and conducted quality control on written content. In total, he has worked on several thousand sites and clocked-in nearly a million words. His dedication, team spirit, and exceptional talent earned him a well-deserved promotion to Lead Editor last Winter. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Under the direction of the head of Content, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Alexander L Hess</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, MBA, Nick is poised to continue his professional-quality work with Doctor Genius. As he describes, “writing is a passion of mine, and I intend to take that passion into my everyday work. With my skills and experience, I plan to continue guiding our content department on our growth path and ensuring our clients receive the quality content they deserve.”</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Author Panel -->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Quality Content Over Quantity</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Creating quality content and helping oversee the creation of said content involves focusing on three main areas mentioned earlier: resources, SEO terminology, and comprehensible content.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Resources</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A major component of writing and editing content involves searching for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\">professional and credible resources</a>. Not only does this help our writers to learn better and understand the topic, but it also helps to flesh out the web pages for patients. The overall goal is to help patients learn and understand the specific service or treatment before scheduling an appointment. We focus on using .org websites, academic sources, and other information databases with this in mind.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SEO Terminology</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While the client has a list of keywords and terms relevant to their services, we strike a balance between SEO and comprehension. This way, the content is not weighed down with too many keywords to the point of being spam— this practice is often referred to as “keyword stuffing.” However, we still strive to use more technical or precise terms somewhere on a page to increase the chance of a patient searching that term online and finding our client’s website. This balance is struck by understanding <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-explains-the-difference-between-neural-matching-and-rankbrain/299713/\">neural matching</a>, which is writing content that will help a search engine present content that greatly matches a searcher&#8217;s intention. By working with our marketing team, we can determine the best course of action for each patient. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Comprehensible Content</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As an editor, I take the necessary time to read content for more than just errors. The content needs to be understandable for patients so that they are comfortable receiving medical services and are more likely to opt for the right treatment. At the same time, we strive to ensure it is factual and informative. This translates into clearly looking through every piece of content for its ability to reach the intended audience in a way that matches their specific needs. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to Start Getting High-Quality Content Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">By our content team continuing to grow, we will continue to offer more new digital assets that improve client ranking.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge.
