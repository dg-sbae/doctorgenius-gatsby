Since then, however, search technology has evolved to incorporate artificial intelligence, which enables the search engine to deliver the most accurate results based on several variables, with keywords being just one of them. Google refers to this new and improved search as “semantic search” and scores websites based on their “semantic distance.”</p>\r\n<h2>The introduction of semantic search</h2>\r\n<p>Semantic search is not a new idea, though many brands are only just now incorporating the concept into their content marketing strategies. Back in 2013, Google realized that because <a href=\"https://envato.com/blog/semantic-search/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://envato.com/blog/semantic-search/\">people communicate through conversations, not keywords</a>, it was time to make some serious changes. As a result, it released the Hummingbird algorithm, which was designed to improve the search engine’s understanding of users’ search queries and deliver more accurate results faster.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike previous algorithms, which returned results based solely on keywords, Hummingbird understood that words have multiple meanings. Thus, it used AI to gather information about a user’s location, search history, spelling, and context to better understand the intent behind a search term. Google then used this data to quickly analyze full questions and rank results based on a particular user’s previously indexed content. Content that ranks higher is deemed to have a better “semantic score.”</p>\r\n<h2>Improving your semantic distance score</h2>\r\n<p>Regardless of industry, optimizing content for semantic search is essential. However, because you are in the medical field, it is even more so for your content.</p>\r\n<p>One of the simplest ways to optimize your medical content for semantic search is by using potential patients’ natural language. Medical professionals use highly technical language that is difficult to understand, much less spell or pronounce. Moreover, the medical field is replete with clinical jargon and acronyms with which the average person is unfamiliar. For instance, as a dentist, you may refer to a deep cleaning as “dental prophylaxis.” However, chances are low that anyone other than another dental professional searches for a dentist by that term. By simply describing these services as “teeth cleaning,” you can drastically expand your audience base.</p>\r\n<p>However, improving your semantic score is not as simple as speaking your audience’s lingo. Google considers several variables when delivering results. Below are additional <a href=\"https://blog.alexa.com/semantic-search/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://blog.alexa.com/semantic-search/\">strategies you can use to make semantic search work for you</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Create highly targeted and useful content that <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-neural-matching/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-neural-matching/\">turns the keyword into the topic</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Optimize content for featured snippets (e.g., clearly answer questions in your content in concise ways and while targeting long-tail keywords)</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search\">Optimize your content for voice search</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Use companion keywords, linguistic variations, and synonyms</li>\r\n\t<li>Add schema markup, or structured data, to the backend of your content to tell Google what your content is about</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Improve your semantic searchability</h2>\r\n<p>Artificial intelligence may be what makes semantic search possible, but improving the semantic searchability of your site does not have to be so technical. In fact, all you really have to do to succeed with Google’s latest algorithms is to offer highly valuable content.

Clients rely heavily on reviews and site content when choosing<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/why-simple-and-concise-sentences-matter/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Creating valuable website content is a priority for medical practices. Clients rely heavily on reviews and site content when choosing a new provider. Separating your practice from similar ones may come down to content design and website readability. Keeping things such as language and sentence structure simple may not only boost your SEO ranking, but it can also capture more business. Find out how keeping things simple can make all the difference when trying to attract more clients.</p>\r\n<h2>Readers have a short attention span</h2>\r\n<p>The world runs at a quick pace, and building a practice page that caters to this is imperative. With the demands of work and family obligations, readers do not want to spend time conducting extensive research to find a provider. Websites that present information in a concise and precise manner tend to top the list in search results, in part due to the ease with which readers can get the information they want. The quicker visitors find what is needed from your site, the more likely they are to return or, better yet, make an appointment. Simplifying website content to make it user-friendly may result in more conversions than you might think.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing tools that simplify content</h2>\r\n<p>A website has only a few seconds to grab a potential client&#8217;s attention and keep them on the page. One way to do this is by creating content that is user friendly, eye-catching, and relevant. Using a more simplistic writing style is beneficial as it tends to reach a wider audience and keep them engaged longer.</p>\r\n<h3>Short sentences</h3>\r\n<p>For a medical practice, you may believe that using an elevated vocabulary and complex sentence structure makes you sound like more of an expert. However, these things lead to fewer conversions because visitors cannot get the message fast enough. Long sentences can prove hard to follow and process. When readers need to read something more than once to understand it, they will likely move on to another site.</p>\r\n<h3>Headings</h3>\r\n<p>With the barrage of information available on the internet, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">readers tend to skim articles</a> to find what they want. Making content easy to scan is crucial for keeping readers engaged with your practice&#8217;s website. Shorter sentences are faster to read. Paragraph headers make finding information at a glance easier by breaking up content in a concise and organized fashion. Headings, along with short sentences, make navigating a webpage for relevant insight quicker.</p>\r\n<h3>Graphics</h3>\r\n<p>People like visually appealing web pages. Using graphics on your practice&#8217;s page allows potential clients a peek inside your office. Pictures can also draw the eye to other areas you wish to highlight. According to <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm\">washington.edu</a>, website graphics should:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Guide readers to focus on essential portions of the text</li>\r\n\t<li>Conform to the design of the site</li>\r\n\t<li>Not bog the site down with longer loading times</li>\r\n\t<li>Not take away from the content of the page</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Help is at the ready</h2>\r\n<p>The task of creating relevant and easily digestible content for your practice&#8217;s website may feel overwhelming, but we can help.

As experts from the University of Illinois have found, the mouth is the leading entryway to the body and is known as the window to a person&#8217;s general health. A complete health dentist understands the connection between oral and overall health, running their practice on the application of modern dentistry with a focus on systemic relief.</p>\r\n<p>Patients who take proper hygiene measures to ensure their oral health is up to par may have fewer general health problems. Although many conditions, illnesses, and diseases are genetic, it is possible to combat others through proper oral hygiene. Understanding and applying the oral-systemic link can profoundly enhance patients’ health and well-being and provide new fundamentals that can improve your practice’s profitability.</p>\r\n<h2>Dental Conditions That Can Be Detected</h2>\r\n<p>Regular dental checkups provide dentists with information regarding a patient’s oral health and any problems they may have. A complete health dentist considers the oral-systemic link and conducts a more intensive, thorough examination of not just the mouth but the entire face, neck, and throat. This allows them to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a person’s health and come closer to diagnosing any dental conditions.</p>\r\n<h2>Cavities and Cracked Teeth</h2>\r\n<p>Cavities and caries are the root causes of initial tooth decay caused by a breakdown of the tooth&#8217;s enamel. Cavities are also the leading cause of tooth decay and tooth loss. According to the CDC, &#8220;Untreated tooth decay can lead to [an] abscess (a severe infection) under the gums which can spread to other parts of the body and have serious, and in rare cases fatal, results.&#8221; Infections include gum disease, and, in more severe cases, periodontal disease, which can both impact the body systems, especially the digestive and respiratory tracts.</p>\r\n<p>Cracked teeth can occur in a variety of ways: craze lines, cracked cusps, cracked teeth, and split teeth. Cracked or broken teeth can cause many oral and general health problems, as cracks give way to bacteria and infection. The Oral Health Foundation finds that &#8220;If they are not treated, cracked teeth can lead to the death of the nerve, and an abscess might grow.&#8221; An abscess is full of pus and bacteria, allowing bacteria to travel through various tracts to the body upon breaking open.</p>\r\n<h3>Gum and Periodontal Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Gum disease is the leading cause of tooth decay, tooth loss, and, in severe cases, periodontal disease. Gum and periodontal disease, characterized by sensitive and inflamed gums, are linked to decay, resulting in tooth and bone loss when left untreated. Complete health dentists can detect early signs of gum disease and treat patients before it progresses to periodontal disease or general health conditions that are harder or less likely to treat.</p>\r\n<h3>Oral Cancers</h3>\r\n<p>Complete health dentists screen for oral cancer during routine dental visits in an attempt to find lesions and signs of cancer or precancer symptoms. According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, 35,000 Americans will be diagnosed with oral cancer each year. Identifying sores, cysts, lesions, and other conditions of cancer early greatly aids in recovery benefits.</p>\r\n<h2>Medical Conditions That Can Be Detected</h2>\r\n<p>Many oral and systemic conditions and diseases coincide, simultaneously affecting one another. Complete health dentists are aware of these conditions and the signs that would appear in the mouth, face, neck, or throat with such conditions. At the same time, oral conditions that can affect or cause general health conditions are also apparent and discussed to prevent or treat other conditions.</p>\r\n<h3>Heart Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Poor oral health increases the risk of bacteria and infection entering the bloodstream, particularly affecting patients with artificial heart valves. The Mayo Clinic found that &#8220;heart disease, clogged arteries, and stroke might be linked to the inflammation and infections that oral bacteria can cause.&#8221; Periodontal disease, a severe form of gum disease, is associated with an increased risk of developing a heart condition.</p>\r\n<h3>Diabetes</h3>\r\n<p>Diabetes is another common condition that both affects and is affected by gum disease. The Mayo Clinic suggests, &#8220;by reducing the body&#8217;s resistance to infection, diabetes puts your gums at risk.” Gum and periodontal care can help manage diabetes while maintaining stability in blood sugar can also help mitigate gum and periodontal disease.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Conditions Affected by Oral Health:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Endocarditis</li>\r\n\t<li>Pregnancy: premature birth and low birth rate</li>\r\n\t<li>Thyroid</li>\r\n\t<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Medications That Affect Oral Health</h2>\r\n<p>Through extensive research, clinical trials, and experience, researchers have found that many medications for various health conditions affect patients’ oral health. Therefore, complete health dentists have a record of each patient’s medical history along with a list of all medications they have taken or are currently taking. They can also alter certain medications to fit the patient&#8217;s needs and help curb their symptoms or side effects while offering guidance in navigating general health conditions during dental treatment.</p>\r\n<p>A few of the most common medications that affect the mouth include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cancer medications</li>\r\n\t<li>Diabetes medications</li>\r\n\t<li>Regulatory medicines (i.e., cardiovascular or thyroid)</li>\r\n\t<li>Antidepressants</li>\r\n\t<li>High blood pressure medication</li>\r\n\t<li>Pain relievers and sedatives</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>NextLevel Practice Partnership</h2>\r\n<p>Complete health dentistry not only changed the way in which dentists view and treat patients, it also gave health professionals and patients across the board an enhanced idea of the extent to which dental and general health are connected. It allows patients to better care for themselves and dentists to provide better dialogue in terms of how conditions are being affected and the prevention or treatments required. Treating patients comprehensively also enables good patient-doctor rapport and builds stronger communication, which helps treat patients more accurately.</p>\r\n<p>Many dentists and practices are aware of the oral-systemic health connection and interested in converting their practice but may not know how to start. With its growing popularity, we have extended our knowledge and expertise about complete health dentistry through our collaboration with NextLevel Practice (NLP), led by visionary Gary Kadi. Now, we work with clients on curating a Complete Health Practice Plan alongside Kadi’s NextLevel Practice and its various products and programs to provide the framework and a plan. Coupled with the NLPs programs, Doctor Genius customizes clients’ sites to be both visually-appealing and address the complete health philosophy that informs patients of the health services they provide.</p>\r\n<h3><br />\r\nLearn About Complete Health Dentistry</h3>\r\n<p>With Kadi’s expertise in this specific field and our ability to create new branding through site recreation and SEO strategic implementation, your practice can gain tremendous success and new patient outreach.</p>\r\n<p>If you are ready to join the growing number of health professionals practicing complete health, <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">reach out</a> and we can help you learn more, answer any questions, and help you get started.
