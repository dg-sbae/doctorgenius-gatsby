While you may have<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/marketing-funnel-for-patients/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>In general, the marketing funnel describes the process of generating leads and converting them into customers. While you may have a clear idea of what this progression looks like from the perspective of a medical practitioner, visualizing the funnel from the viewpoint of the patient can help you understand why each step in the process is essential and focus on strategies that your target audience is more likely to respond to.</p>\r\n<h2>The stages of the marketing funnel</h2>\r\n<p>There are several different representations used to explain the steps of the marketing funnel, which can range from three to eight stages or more. However, no matter the number or label used, the process typically covers awareness, consideration, and purchase. Each of these steps affects the patient experience in a unique way and depends on the other to guide the individual towards making a purchase.</p>\r\n<h3>Awareness</h3>\r\n<p>The first part of the marketing funnel, often called lead generation from an advertiser’s point of view, is the moment when the patient first becomes aware of your medical practice and services. There are several ways a person can come to this step, including exposure through viewing an advertisement placed on a social media site, seeing your practice on the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/\">search engine ranking page</a> after searching for a related keyword such as “family dentist near Roseville,” or hearing about your practice from a friend or family member. While there is much more that goes in advertising and targeting from your end as the medical practitioner or owner of a medical office, the introduction should feel natural and simple to the patient.</p>\r\n<h3>Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>After patients become aware of your brand, they transition into the consideration stage. For people who do not connect with your practice or are not in need of the services you offer, the interaction may end here. For those who are part of your target audience or within your scope of influence, this step is critical for securing a conversion.</p>\r\n<p>The patient wants to know that you offer the needed services, have a good reputation, and are qualified to do the job at hand. While some patients may be ready to employ your services quickly, others may need more time in the consideration stage. These individuals may explore your website for reviews and testimonials, browse through any <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/\">educational content on your site</a>, search for your educational background and areas of expertise, or ask questions and engage with your office to determine if it is a good fit.</p>\r\n<h3>Purchase</h3>\r\n<p>Next, the patient makes the choice to call your office and sent up an initial appointment. Even after deciding to get your services, however, patients may hesitate or forget to follow through. Automated email reminders, calls from a staff member, free consultation offers, or invitations to a special webinar can all help guide them to finalizing the appointment.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you master the marketing funnel</h2>\r\n<p>Knowing how to effectively guide potential patients through the marketing funnel takes significant expertise and practice.

Because the<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/5-cost-accounting-tips-for-a-medical-practice/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Although it is a newer concept, cost accounting can be very beneficial for medical practices of all sizes. Because the demand to lower the cost of health care is becoming more urgent, it can be helpful to streamline the process of eliminating unnecessary expenses by understanding and implementing this type of accounting system. </p>\r\n<h2>What is cost accounting?</h2>\r\n<p>A cost accounting system focuses on recording, classifying, and allocating the expenses of a company to help determine the actual cost of services and products. The idea is when the exact uses of funds are known, costs of services and products can not only be clearly defined but also reduced. This accounting method can also help pinpoint the profitability of specific ventures or expenditures so more well-informed decisions can be made about future purchases or endeavors.</p>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/healthcare-cost-accounting-8-strategies-to-streamline-implementation-and-quickly-achieve-measurable-results.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/healthcare-cost-accounting-8-strategies-to-streamline-implementation-and-quickly-achieve-measurable-results.html\">Becker&#8217;s Hospital CFO Report</a>, the main obstacle to overcome when trying to implement a cost accounting system is creating an accurate Relative Value Unit without being overwhelmed or confused by the math. Because the RVU ultimately helps to determine the costs associated with the charge description master, which can be extensive and complex, it is important to establish clear, correct RVUs before proceeding further. It is also crucial to have the cooperation of everyone involved with the practice since efficient communication of data can be a large part of the process. </p>\r\n<h2>5 ways to make cost accounting work for a medical practice</h2>\r\n<p>There are differences between how a traditional company and a medical practice operate, but an accounting method like this can work particularly well in a service industry where costs are tied more to time and expertise than products. Here are some tips to help your medical practice implement an effective cost accounting system. </p>\r\n<h3>1. Delegate to responsible team members</h3>\r\n<p>Rather than having one person attempt to figure out all the RVUs alone, it can be helpful to get other staff members involved. Especially for larger practices with multiple departments, tasking a tenured, capable staff member from each department with compiling specific RVUs can speed the process up quite a bit. Even for smaller practices, enlisting the assistance of staff members who are familiar with the services and products can help establish these amounts more accurately. When deciding who to select for the assignment, take into consideration factors such as how well the employee knows the CDM codes, resource consumption, and operating procedures. </p>\r\n<h3>2. Ensure the correct CDM codes are being used</h3>\r\n<p>Aside from their importance for cost accounting, correct CDM usage is beneficial for patients and medical practices alike to ensure proper billing and insurance charges. Because CDM codes play a significant role in defining the RVUs, CDMs used incorrectly can result in inaccurate numbers. Charges are also becoming increasingly automated, and some software does not require individual service codes to be entered manually. Before relying on CDM codes to help generate RVUs, it can be important to revisit how the codes are being applied to get the most accurate RVUs possible. According to the <a href=\"https://www.hfma.org/topics/article/57212.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hfma.org/topics/article/57212.html\">Healthcare Financial Management Association</a>, respondents to a survey reported the area that most needed improvement was statistics and RVUs. This shows team members are aware of a deficiency and may welcome additional training in this area. </p>\r\n<h3>3. Utilize all available techniques and data</h3>\r\n<p>It is not necessary to develop all the RVUs from scratch. For some services and products, there will be information such as actual cost, industry-standard RVUs, and staffing ratios that allow the RVU to be determined quickly. In many cases, the actual cost of products is known or can be determined easily by contacting the vendor rep. Some factors, such as time spent on a service or clinical skill level required, are also fairly objective and can be used to develop a standardized RVU. In many cases, a minimum cost for these factors already exists, and all that is left to do is determining how much the margin needs to increase to meet the fiscal needs of the practice. </p>\r\n<h3>4. Prioritize</h3>\r\n<p>There should naturally be a large difference in dollar amount between your most costly and least costly RVUs. Instead of determining them by department, alphabetically, or using some other method, it can be a good idea to start with the RVUs that cost the most. Whether they cost more because of the time or resources involved, or because they are used the most frequently, these are often the RVUs that determine the profitability of the practice. For example, if your RVUs are below the national benchmark average, but you have a high patient volume, you may need to take a look at the efficiency of your practice in order to grow. </p>\r\n<h3>5. Get the math right</h3>\r\n<p>Arriving at an accurate RVU is more complicated than simply taking the purchase costs and adding subjective charges to get a number. The base price of a product or service is not merely the cost associated with acquiring the item or performing the service. Other factors that add to the initial cost must be added to determine the true value. The following variables must be taken into account:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Labor costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Building lease costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Equipment costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Office supply costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Malpractice and insurance premium costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Time</li>\r\n\t<li>Necessary clinical skill</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are costs that need to be incorporated into the RVUs to keep a practice profitable. It is also important to adjust for a geographic variance. It is absolutely possible to calculate RVUs manually, and for smaller practices, this can be the least expensive choice. Especially for practices with tenured, experienced team members able to help with determining RVUs, it can be a way to encourage staff involvement and elevate thinking. Larger practices may want to consider investing in software or calculation programs and automating the process as much as possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more practice management best practices</h2>\r\n<p>Cost accounting is just one of many ways to improve the health of your medical practice.

This number measures the size of outstanding accounts based on average sales days instead of units of currency. The DSO can be quickly calculated by dividing the total of accounts receivable from a certain period of time by the complete sum of credit sales during that same amount of time, then dividing the answer by how many days were in that period.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/d/days-sales-outstanding-dso\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/d/days-sales-outstanding-dso\">Investing Answers</a> suggests the DSO is crucial because it is a measure of how quickly a company collects money, which directly correlates to the efficiency and profitability of the company. A medical practice is no exception. Comparing the DSO of several practices can show which ones are better at managing credit and efficiently using receivables to foster growth. A practice can also compare its DSO numbers over time to tell whether it is becoming more or less efficient. </p>\r\n<h2>Ways to reduce the DSO for your practice</h2>\r\n<p>If your practice has a high DSO, there are several ways both the staff and patients can help lower it.</p>\r\n<h3>Examine customer payment terms</h3>\r\n<p>A practice with looser payment terms generally has a higher DSO than one with very strict terms. How long do patients have to pay a bill once they leave the office? Is payment required at the time of service? Establishing a balance of common industry standards, the DSO of your practice and the needs of the patients can help pinpoint the necessary terms to offer. </p>\r\n<h3>Switch to automated billing</h3>\r\n<p>Particularly for practices with a high ratio of patients to staff members, it can be a good idea to have an automated billing process. This helps ensure bills are sent out on time and do not get lost in the shuffle. Simply put, the faster patients receive a bill, the faster they can pay it. If your practice still sends out paper statements and bills, you may want to consider electronic billing. Online invoicing and billing make it possible for a patient to receive and pay a bill the same day it is sent out instead of days or weeks later. This method also allows payments to be easily tracked as opposed to checks and payment stubs that can be more labor-intensive to monitor. </p>\r\n<h3>Pay attention to invoicing</h3>\r\n<p>Even if your billing is already automated, it is important to be detailed when inputting patient and invoicing information. A bill sent to the wrong patient or address will not get paid. Are the invoices accurate and being sent out on time? Even small errors in amounts due or account numbers can end up costing the practice significant amounts of money. Spot-checking invoices is a good way to find and fix common errors that can delay payments and increase the DSO. </p>\r\n<h3>Offer multiple methods of payment</h3>\r\n<p>The fastest way to get paid is obviously to ask the patients for payments upfront. However, there are cases where patients may not be able to pay the full amount at once and need to spread out payments. Rather than sending out monthly statements and bills and relying on the patient to mail a check or call and make a payment over the phone, consider having an online payment portal. A well-planned internet payment system can allow patients to view statements and make payments quickly and easily. The less work involved with paying a bill, the more likely and faster a patient is to pay it. </p>\r\n<h3>Consistently follow up with patients</h3>\r\n<p>Following up can be one of the most effective ways to make sure patients do not ignore invoices. Email reminders and text message reminders typically work well, and phone call reminders can be even better because of the personal touch of talking directly to another human being. This can be particularly helpful with bills that are past due. To keep your practice&#8217;s DSO where it should be, which is ideally 10-15 days beyond the terms of sale, staff members need to be proactive about sending reminders or making phone calls. </p>\r\n<h3>Offer incentives</h3>\r\n<p>Far from costing the practice money, offering early payment discounts can be a smart way to keep cash flow in the practice instead of tied up in accounts receivable. It can be a win for both the practice and the patientd, because the patients pay less and the practice gets the capital sooner. Having a faster cash flow, getting better rates from creditors, and saving interest on loan fees are just a few ways receiving faster patient payments can improve the balance sheet of a practice. Charging a late payment penalty is another option to help offset some of the costs the practice incurs when the billing moves to a collections department. </p>\r\n<h3>Stay committed</h3>\r\n<p>Lowering your DSO does not happen overnight. If your goal is to reduce it by 20 days, it can take several months to see significant progress. While it can be motivating to see that number drop, the initial excitement of making a difference can wear off quickly. Effecting significant improvements and sustaining them long-term requires a change of habits in everyone from the executives to the billing department. Setting expectations for the staff regarding accounts receivable and regularly discussing DSO metrics can help maintain focus and ensure all the effort put into lowering the DSO is not wasted. </p>\r\n<h2>We can help you improve practice management</h2>\r\n<p>There are many ways to take your practice management skills to the next level.
