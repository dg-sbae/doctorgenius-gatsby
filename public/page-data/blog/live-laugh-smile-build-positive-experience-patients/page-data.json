Unfortunately, a dental visit is most likely not on that list for many people. A dental practice needs to create a positive experience for patients. Fortunately, there are a variety of methods to do just that.\r\n<h3>Build a positive experience for patients</h3>\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, finds that only 62 percent of adults between the ages of 18 to 64 visited the dentist in 2014. The CDC also finds that 83 percent of children ages 2 to 17 visited the dentist at least once the same year. It is apparent that adults do not view dental care with the same level of importance for themselves as they do for their children. While adults may have a variety of reasons for a lack of dental checkups from financial difficulties to busy schedules, adults need regular dental care as much as children do.\r\n\r\nHowever, many adults may avoid necessary checkups due to the negative stigma surrounding dentistry. People associate a dental visit as painful, even though technology has advanced to the point where dentistry is comfortable. Patients may not always remember that a dentist can help keep a smile beautiful and healthy. By creating a positive environment for the patient, a practice can help patients feel more comfortable and welcome during the appointment. A practice can also educate the patients on the available methods and technology, helping patients understand that appointments can virtually be pain-free.\r\n\r\n<h5><em>&#8220;63 percent of the children indicated that they preferred a decorated dental clinic over a plain clinic.&#8221;</em></h5>\r\n\r\nTo do this, professionals need to begin by presenting a comforting office from the waiting room to the dental chair. Having magazines for adults and activity books for kids is one example of how to at least begin to lighten up a room. A practice needs to be responsive to the patient’s need from scheduling the appointment to dealing with insurance coverage and payment after the appointment. A patient wants a great smile, but may not always want to go through the process for the smile if it is a negative experience.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-413\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>Don’t worry, be happy</h3>\r\nA study published online in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, conducted by Maha Al-Sarheed, Ph.D., at King Saud University, had 583 children answer a questionnaire. The child participants ranged in age from 9 to 12 years and attended public schools. The study finds that &#8220;63 percent of the children indicated that they preferred a decorated dental clinic over a plain clinic.&#8221; Even a simple change as some decorations on the wall can have a positive effect on younger patients.\r\n\r\nWhile there is not too much that a professional can do to change a dental procedure, a professional can educate their patients on the procedure prior to beginning. For instance, a dental practice can break down the steps of the checkup process for the patient to understand. The professional can also take some time to ask how the individual is doing since the last checkup. For new patients, the professional can introduce the other members of his or her practice and go over what the practice is about.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the possible methods for creating a positive experience at a dental practice.

With the digital market growing and becoming a prominent factor for all types of businesses, it is crucial for a business to maximize their online presence. This statistic applies to private dental practices as well as various forms of shopping, with more people reading reviews online, researching practice websites, comparing procedure rates and locations before scheduling an appointment.\r\n<h3>Oh, the platforms your practice will end up on</h3>\r\nWhen possible patients search for a practice online, the location is one of the key factors in making a decision. In fact, a common search term is “professional dentist near me.” Thus, many possible patients will end up on Google Maps, searching for a practice near their location that will accept their insurance.\r\n\r\nIn an article written by Raj Nijjer and posted on geomarketing.com, Nijjer lists four ways to drive in-store traffic with Google Maps. The four steps are:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Be there when people search for you on Google</li>\r\n \t<li>Happy customers make great promoters</li>\r\n \t<li>Pictures show what’s exceptional</li>\r\n \t<li>Give people an insider view</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAlthough these steps seem basic, they are fundamental in helping to promote a private practice. Google Maps has the ability to display more than simply the location of a company, so companies need to utilize all possible tools. Include the basics on a Google Maps profile with hours, practice title and any promotion deals available. By giving patients a location and images of an actual property, it validates the practice by making it a real website for the patient.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-422\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15b-TheStudy-Google-Map-markeing-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h3>You control how potential patients see your practice</h3>\r\n<h5>In 2013, GE Capital Retail Bank’s Second Annual Shopper Study found that 81 percent of shoppers research online before visiting the actual store.</h5>\r\nWhile a practice cannot control the thoughts or reactions of patients online and in the office, a practice can control the image that they present online. As Nijjer stated, “Happy customers make great promoters.” Reviews are a crucial part of the decision-making process. While the patient can write whatever they feel like writing, a positive review will go a long way to helping bring new patients into the practice.\r\n\r\nIt is also crucial to respond to a negative review with a professional answer. People may search for a negative review to figure out if the review is real or false. The review needs to have a name and cannot be anonymous. It can also beneficial for the practice to respond to the client’s review.\r\n\r\nAlong with providing patient feedback online, a practice can also provide professional photos of the practice. Similar to how a restaurant produces photos of signature dishes and the dining area, a private dental practice will benefit from posting professional photos of the dental chairs, machinery, waiting room and more.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Doctor Genius can help to provide the digital platform for a private practice and provide quality control for the practice’s website. We will create a new website for the practice and help the practice maintain an active presence online. If you are looking to rank higher on Google searches and develop a stronger online presence, then do not hesitate to seek professional services with Doctor Genius.\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
