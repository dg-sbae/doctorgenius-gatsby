By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.

Without the requisite knowledge to inform<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>As a medical provider, staying on top of new advances and developments is crucial. Without the requisite knowledge to inform patients of options and effectively treat them, you will not only suffer a loss of business, but you also may suffer a loss of professional integrity. While it is essential to stay grounded in older routines and those products that are still relevant, newer tools may provide more opportunities to attract new clients and offer new options to existing ones. Understanding what happens from the time medical products are introduced until they become irrelevant may help when it comes to medical marketing.</p>\r\n<h2>Staying informed of new trends</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to providing the best options for patient treatment, technological trends and developments are crucial. The ability to introduce patients to a full array of potential solutions to health problems results in a higher rate of successful recovery. Keeping an eye on medical journals, doing independent research on clinical trials, and speaking with an equipment representative may prove sufficient to stay abreast of trends.</p>\r\n<h2>The stages of medical products</h2>\r\n<p>Once a new medical product becomes available, company reps strive to reach relevant practices. The more medical providers use it and prescribe it, the higher the chance that it will gain notoriety. According to <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534\">thestreet.com</a>, typical product lifecycle management contains four benchmarks: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Each of these stages requires unique marketing strategies to remain competitive.</p>\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Bringing a new medical product to the market can prove difficult, especially if the first phase of the lifecycle is not successful. In the introduction, the company is trying to gain some awareness of the product. Activities during this time include promotions geared towards those medical practices that have patients who may benefit from the new product. </p>\r\n<h3>Growth</h3>\r\n<p>Once the product finds a measure of success, the distributor will want to broaden its horizons and target other areas of the medical community that might utilize it. The distributor may start to change the branding of the product to make it more appealing to a broader audience. Something used primarily for one health condition may be pushed for aiding with another. As long as the data backs up the claims, providers may give it a try.</p>\r\n<h3>Maturity</h3>\r\n<p>Business strategy changes the more successful a product becomes. When product sales plateau, it is a signal that it has reached maturity. To keep the company&#8217;s name at the forefront of the medical community, it now has to make some clear changes to the product or its marketing. In some cases, this results in a 2.0 version of the same item.</p>\r\n<h3>Decline</h3>\r\n<p>When competitors introduce rival products, and sales start to decrease, the lifecycle is declining. This means that a company must either completely reformulate and reintroduce the product or come up with something new.</p>\r\n<h2>Help when you need it</h2>\r\n<p>Convincing clients that your practice is on top of the latest medical products and trends gives them confidence that you are looking out for the best avenues for treatment.

Too often, businesses focus on how a site looks when they should construct it with search engine optimization and information flow in mind. By building your website with clientele needs and <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\">SEO keywords</a> as the driving point, you are more likely to attract a larger target audience.</p>\r\n<h2>Steps to successfully build site architecture</h2>\r\n<p>Site architecture refers to every aspect of your website, including the smallest details that most visitors will not even see: design, layout, easy-to-read content, social media links, contact information, email list sign-ups, etc. Before jumping into design, start by identifying your goals and your customers. What do you want people to discover when landing on your homepage? What kind of visitors do you want your site to attract? Once you have defined these measures, you are ready to work on the following steps for building out your site architecture.</p>\r\n<h3>Find your keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Keywords are the essential tool customers use to find websites that are relevant to an online search. By incorporating the most commonly used keywords into your site, it is more likely to rank higher on the list of results. Consider using tools like Keyword Discovery or Wordtracker to explore keywords that fit your business and audience. Research the competitiveness of each keyword (how often it is used by others in your business), the frequency that each word or phrase is typed into search engines, and the specificity of them (if they are broad terms for customers beginning a search or specific terms for those who are looking for an exact product).</p>\r\n<h3>Create a site map</h3>\r\n<p>A site map is made up of the layers within your website that generate a natural flow of information and link one page to the next. The map is usually designed based on a hierarchical structure, with categories, tags, and backlinks that separate out information in a logical order. The map should be easy to navigate so that a visitor can quickly find the information they are looking for.</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on aesthetics</h3>\r\n<p>Now it is time to focus on your <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#395646be7645\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#395646be7645\">website’s appearance</a> and how well it functions for your audience. This is just as important as establishing keywords and a site map since this is the part the customer actually pays attention to. A website that is confusing to navigate or lacks a clear, concise message on the landing page is more likely to lose viewers quickly. Use headlines and a short blurb at the top of your homepage to inform people about your business and guide visitors toward relevant information. Pictures can help break up text and make a page easier to read.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more ways to improve site architecture</h2>\r\n<p>Building a website right the first time is essential to establish a loyal customer base and grow your business.
