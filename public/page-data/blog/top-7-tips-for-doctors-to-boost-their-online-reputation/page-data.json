Whether proactive or reactive, doctor reputation management<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Online reputation for doctors has become a critical component to a practice&#8217;s success. Whether proactive or reactive, doctor reputation management uses techniques to boost a doctor&#8217;s reputation online. Are you recovering from a malpractice lawsuit or negative press coverage? Have you received too many negative patient reviews? Or perhaps you have very little online presence at all? Try some (or all) of these top tips for doctors who want to improve and manage their online reputation.</p>\r\n<h2>Request Patients Give Google/Yelp Reviews</h2>\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/how-patients-use-online-reviews/\">recent survey</a> found patients&#8217; use of online reviews continues to increase. Ninety-four percent of respondents reported using online reviews to evaluate doctors, and nearly three-fourths (72 percent) say they use online reviews as their first step in finding a new doctor. Establishing a robust online presence in terms of reviews, then, is good practice.<br />\r\nAdditionally, if you are suffering from negative online reviews, then more reviews overall will help. You can flag negative reviews, but you can dilute their impact by encouraging patients to leave positive reviews. Since nearly <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/factsheet\">80 percent of Yelp reviewers</a> leave five-, four-, or three-star ratings, your patients&#8217; reviews are more likely to lean toward the positive end of the spectrum.<br />\r\nMore reviews also factor into Google&#8217;s algorithms and are likely to improve <a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091\">your business&#8217; local rankings</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Respond to All Online Reviews</h2>\r\n<p>Seventy percent of respondents to <a href=\"https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/how-patients-use-online-reviews/\">a recent survey</a> claimed that providers responding publicly to online reviews is “very” or “moderately important.” So, responding in a timely, professional manner to online patient reviews, whether positive or negative, is a key component of most doctor reputation management strategies. For one, responding to reviews demonstrates that you care about your patients. For two, addressing negative reviews helps neutralize its impact, and the reviewer is more likely to retract or edit. Since some <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Yelp-reviews-privacy-laws-hamstring-doctors-9975030.php?psid=h62n1\">medical professionals report</a> experiencing about a 30 percent loss in business after negative Yelp reviews, you should not take bad reviews lightly. And for three, Google&#8217;s algorithms assign higher rankings when businesses respond to users&#8217; reviews.<br />\r\nSimply responding to patient reviews, though, is insufficient and could backfire if not done correctly. To remain compliant with HIPAA privacy standards, you must not confirm that the reviewer is a patient. Your answer must be vague about the patient or specific situations, but you can be specific about your office policies or standard operating procedures. Yelp suggests you privately contact reviewers about concerns. You can contact reviewers with direct messaging if you <a href=\"https://writers.scripted.com/writer/jobs/28472a5c-ac9f-4751-b969-91a6001ea0b0/www.biz.yelp.com\">claim your business on Yelp</a>.<br />\r\nAvoid responding when emotional, or have a designated staff or online reputation management partner respond.</p>\r\n<h2>Maintain an Up-to-Date Website</h2>\r\n<p>When done properly, a <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/the-study/start-new-year-off-right-part-functioning-website-practice/\">doctor-focused website</a> provides several benefits. The website likely will appear first or near the top of a Google search for your name. A website should provide all pertinent information about you, your values, your experience, and your practice. It is your personal digital forum, and you own how you are presented. Even if people searching find less than stellar reviews, your website likely gives a positive first impression, at least.</p>\r\n<h2>Write Blog Posts</h2>\r\n<p>Write blog posts directed to your patients. A regularly updated blog helps you rank higher in Google search results and brings more patients. Great blog content that ranks high for specific keywords drives more clients to your website. Through your blog you can showcase your expertise. Your blog also provides a forum for you to discuss your services.<br />\r\nAlso write guest blog posts for other sites when possible. Not only does doing so help establish thought leadership and generate referral opportunities. Creating new content on other sites is the easiest way to bury negative reviews or press coverage. <br />\r\nClaim Your Google Business Listing <br />\r\nClaiming your business listing on Google, providing business information, and updating your details in a timely manner in <a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091\">Google My Business </a>can help your business’s local ranking on Google. This enhances your business&#8217; presence in Search and Maps. When users search for your name or sometimes just your specialty, they are more likely to see your business listing in local search results.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep Profiles / Listings Updated and Accurate</h2>\r\n<p>Be sure to keep your online information consistent and updated across profiles, locations, and directories, such as Google My Business, Yelp, Facebook, and Apple Maps. Consistent and accurate listings on multiple sites and search engines not only makes you appear engaged and improves Google page ranking, it reduces frustration of patients when trying to learn about your practice. Check for accuracy of hours, addresses, and contact details especially.</p>\r\n<h2>Actively Use Social Media</h2>\r\n<p>Seventy-two percent of people in the United States regularly use at least one <a href=\"https://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/\">social media platform</a>, especially Facebook. If you are not actively engaging on social media, then you are missing countless opportunities to interact with existing and potential clients. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/social-media-seo/196185/\">social media activity impacts </a>Google&#8217;s search results rankings. Consequently, creating and using social media accounts that post regularly strengthens your online reputation.<br />\r\nYou also can use social media to tune into current issues important to your patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jmir.org/2019/3/e10170/\">Recent research</a> indicates that patients are more likely to consult with physicians who show greater effort. Online this means providers who regularly revise their information, publish educational articles for patients, and answer questions posed by patients. Doctors who proactively manage their online reputation, then, increase their opportunities for attracting new patients or maintaining relationships with existing clients.Though your business operates in face-to-face encounters, your virtual interactions significantly impact your practice&#8217;s reputation and the likelihood of expanding your patient base.<br />\r\nBoosting your online reputation requires targeted strategies, routine review, and timely responses. For many doctors, partnering with a third-party expert makes the most sense.

However, they may change their mind and find another practice when they are not greeted with adequate customer service.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the text below, we delve deeper into how proper phone etiquette has the power to book more new patients and earn more referrals for your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Critical Importance of Front Desk Staff</h2>\r\n<p>The front desk serves as the communication hub of your practice. Patients typically spend more time interacting with the support staff at a medical practice than anyone else. In many ways, the waiting room influences patient engagement more than the exam room. Only four percent of <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/patients-no-1-complaint-front-desk-staff.html\">patient complaints</a> focused on the quality of medical care, with 96 percent of complaints related to customer service.</p>\r\n<h3>Impact on Patient Perception of Practice</h3>\r\n<p>Patient satisfaction affects your ratings with insurance plans, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/online-reputation-management\">online reviews</a>, and the likelihood that patients will return. When it comes to satisfaction, patients focus on <a href=\"https://www.medicaleconomics.com/business/3-ways-improve-patient-experience?utm_source=bibblio_recommendation\">a few key areas</a>, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Poor experiences with office staff</li>\r\n\t<li>Impersonal interactions, where they feel more like a number than a person</li>\r\n\t<li>Scheduling difficulties</li>\r\n\t<li>Poor communication with the practice</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Unsatisfied patients are less likely to remain at the practice. One survey reports at least a third of patients would switch to another provider after just one negative experience with the office staff.</p>\r\n<h3>Influence on Patient Referrals</h3>\r\n<p>When patients have an unpleasant experience with a service provider or company, then they are more inclined to speak poorly about that service provider and not likely to make a referral. In a recent industry survey, <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/patient-engagement-health-care-consumer-survey.html\">39 percent</a> of respondents said a practice&#8217;s reputation is one of the top four factors considered when looking for a new doctor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother one-fourth listed a friend or family member&#8217;s recommendation and 20 percent cited high user reviews as deciding factors. Patients&#8217; opinions of your practice, then, play a critical role in gaining new patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Suggested Best Practices to Improve Patient Experience</h2>\r\n<p>Many opportunities for improvement exist. One often overlooked area is how your practice answers (or does not answer) phone calls. As the first entry point into a practice for most patients, your phone system plays an important role. Inefficiencies and inadequacies in your phone system can lead to caller irritation, staff frustration, lost calls and lost patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Availability of Live Person to Answer Calls Promptly</h3>\r\n<p>Even as more healthcare interactions move online, 88 percent of healthcare appointments are still made over the phone. Phone calls should be answered by a live person. If someone calls your office during typical business hours (Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., which allows for busy people to make calls before or after work, or during a lunch break), staff should be available to answer that call. If someone is calling to schedule a first appointment, reaching voicemail instead of a person may lead to that potential new patient simply calling another practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Training of Front Desk Staff</h3>\r\n<p>All staff in your practice require customer service skills, but your front desk and phone answering staff especially need the proper training. They need to understand the important role they play in the patient experience and your expectations when engaging with the public. Courteous language, a friendly demeanor, and a patient-centric orientation are some of the training topics needed.</p>\r\n<h3>Greetings to Use When Answering the Phone</h3>\r\n<p>While answering the phone is essential, how the staff answers the phone is even more so. If staff are abrupt, speak with a flat tone, or act rudely, then patients will feel unwelcome. The greeting staff use when answering a phone call is influential. Scripts can be helpful in guiding staff on proper phone etiquette.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, here is an <a href=\"https://www.dentaleconomics.com/practice/patient-communication-and-patient-financing/article/14039590/dental-practices-must-make-a-good-impression-with-friendly-phone-etiquette\">outstanding greeting</a>: &#8220;Thank you for choosing Premier Dental. This is Paula. With whom am I speaking? Hello, Stephanie. How may I assist you today?&#8221; This greeting thanks the caller for choosing your practice. Giving and getting names forms a personal connection. The last sentence provides a patient-centric, service orientation and projects a professional image.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst impressions matter. Don&#8217;t let your first also be your last.</p>","date":"October 3, 2019","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Practice Management"}],"author":{"name":"Doctor Genius Marketing"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/7887283252a234d4aaaea274a59e4595/47498/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7887283252a234d4aaaea274a59e4595/9dc27/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg 300w,\n/static/7887283252a234d4aaaea274a59e4595/4fe8c/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg 600w,\n/static/7887283252a234d4aaaea274a59e4595/47498/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"}}},"id":"9f756e48-5282-5f5b-8fc1-49bae3f8aa2b"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":["Marketing and branding do wonders for bringing potential patients to your practice.

This event is a weekend full of the latest advancements in dentistry with courses on effective dental practice techniques, over 550 exhibitors from all areas of the dental market and a plethora of speakers &#8211; among which, Doctor Genius will be present.</p>\r\n<h3>Offering the Marketing Solutions Every Dental Practice Needs</h3>\r\n<p>Dental practices can greatly benefit from having a strong online presence and an active website. Doctor Genius not only offers professionals a chance for a stronger online presence, but we also keep the website active by using key marketing techniques to help professionals extend their reach online. Doctor Genius will be at booth #244 at the CDA event to go over the marketing solutions and available technologies. Here is a list summarizing our services.</p>\r\n<h3>Website</h3>\r\n<p>We create custom content and personalize websites for each client. At Doctor Genius, the client can feel safe knowing that the website contains all of his or her services in one place.</p>\r\n<h3>Branding</h3>\r\n<p>We also deliver effective brand strategies to help give practices a major edge in competitive markets. We will use the proper branding to highlight the client’s services and areas of expertise.</p>\r\n<h3>Search Marketing</h3>\r\n<p>We can narrow down the list of keywords to the words that most frequently appear in people’s searches online. With a list of keywords for each client, we can work to yield higher numbers of new patient inquiries into one’s practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Review Management</h3>\r\n<p>We can highlight positive and easily-readable reviews of a client’s practice on the website. After reading the reviews, patients will be more likely to consider a practice for dental care.</p>\r\n<h3>Hyper-Local Targeting</h3>\r\n<p>We will increase the focus of a client’s website to the local area and enhance the client’s reach to possible patients there. By targeting the local area, we can help the client rank higher online in the local area.</p>\r\n<h3>Social Media</h3>\r\n<p>We will not only help monitor and create regular posts for the client’s social media pages, but we will also ensure that the social media pages remain active and engage followers.</p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Voice Search Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p>We will properly optimize your website for voice search as Google is shifting from a search engine to an “answer engine.” Voice search drastically improves user experience – and because of that, by the year 2020, 50% of all online searches will be made through voice search.</p>\r\n<p>With HIPPA compliant voice technology features, devices such as Amazon Alexa have developed their technology to allow patients, caregivers and healthcare members to provide better patient experiences. You might be asking, “why?” The answer is that these voice features help patients perform healthcare-related tasks, access their health data and interact with their providers. Voice search optimization can certainly impact practice revenue, improving brand awareness, and attracting more new patients online.</p>\r\n<p>The main reason your Healthcare SEO strategy should continuously refine and evolve is because of how different text and voice searches actually are. Since users of voice search are essentially having a conversation with their personal assistant device, your content should fit this context. Answering questions promptly and accurately is key for ranking but most importantly, will further enhance your online digital marketing efforts.</p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Start with a Strong Foot Forward</span></h3>\r\n<p>We help clients build trustworthy relationships with their patients by providing strong online content. We also provide ranking reports and help maximize the client’s website for better results.
