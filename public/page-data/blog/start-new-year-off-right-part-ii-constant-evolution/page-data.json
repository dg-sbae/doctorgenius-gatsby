In the beginning, things seem to work out and the website attracts more patients. Over time, less and less new patients contact the practice. Looking online, the professional finds that the website is broken on certain pages and does not appear in the first few pages of most Google searches. This professional needs a company like Doctor Genius to provide constant maintenance for any issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Constant maintenance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for a website to run smoothly, there needs to be constant maintenance from a skilled professional. At Doctor Genius, we have a team of professionals who can provide the necessary website maintenance to help our clients receive the benefits of a website for their practice. If there is ever an issue with the website, we have professionals available to help fix it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also continue to help monitor other mechanisms within the website and ensure that they are running properly. One of the main functions of a website is to bring in new patients. While a website can offer patients a system for scheduling an appointment online, many offer an office phone number for the patient to contact the practice. However, a call tracking system can help keep track of what is working and what is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">According to Invoca, 65 percent of people prefer to contact a business by phone as opposed to the 24 percent who prefer to fill out a form online.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1089\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Call tracking system</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Professionals may not realize that the importance of a call tracking system. A call tracking system can help to analyze all marketing efforts of a website and determine which are the most effective. At Doctor Genius, we can help determine what is bringing in new patients and what is not. We can then change the website for these needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Invoca states that 73 percent of marketers prefer to feature phone numbers in marketing emails if they can effectively track the data. While texting is a more common form of communication in other situations, people want to be able to speak with a professional representative about the available services. At Doctor Genius, we can track if the emails with a phone number are effective or if the social media page is the source of new patients calling in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our call tracking system, other services and website maintenance, we can help you reach new patients in an effective manner while also help with patient retention. If you are interested in building a website for your practice or updating your current one, do not hesitate to give us a call today.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

While a post may not be necessary every day, it is important to have regular posts that display the website is active. Google sees this as a “freshness signal” that boosts your ranking and will be less inclined to put a website that only posted once in the last 6 months anywhere near the top of search results. Thus, custom blog posts can help to keep a website active.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Content marketing for a medical practice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By uploading content on a regular basis, the website can remain active and help a website be more present in Google searches. In fact, even social media can help to promote a practice. HubSpot finds that in 2017, around 74 percent of people say they use Facebook for professional purposes. While other forms of social media can also be effective, medical professionals can use a social media account to promote new content on websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we can help create blogs to post on our clients’ websites each month. The number of blogs will vary per package but can all aim to achieve the same goal of promoting the client’s practice. We also understand how to craft blogs that utilize keywords to help promote a specific service or type of treatment from the client. The content that Doctor Genius posts on a website can also help bring in new patients and increase the conversion rate; the rate at which people click through a link to the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">HubSpot states that in 2017, at least 53 percent of marketers stated that blog content creation was their top inbound marketing priority.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan18-2-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1107\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan18-2-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan18-2-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan18-2-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>The necessary maintenance and support</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand that while many dental practices provide the same general services, there are specialized services that only certain professionals offer. Thus, we can help customize the content to match those specific services. Our Support Team is available to help make changes to website content in order to help it function at its full potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our content can also help bring in new patients to your practice. In fact, in 2016, Econsultancy found that only about 22 percent of businesses were satisfied with their conversion rates. With constant support and regular content uploads each month, we can help you rank higher in Google search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in enhancing your website, give us a call today.

Fortunately, the team at Doctor Genius can underscore your skills and expertise with our website framework effectively. We can also help to provide maintenance and ensure that your website is functioning properly. The first step is to ensure we customize the website to your desires.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding an effective structure for your content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to have quality information on a page that breaks down a professional’s practice. However, it is also important to have a website that functions properly in attracting new patients. The call to action, CTA, is one example of a tool that helps draw patients into the service from the website. The other benefit of a CTA is that it can be more than a simple “Call Now” message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People can customize or personalize a CTA to promote specific products and services. At Doctor Genius, we can help do just that by customizing the CTA for patients, depending on the practice. Out of 93,000 CTAs, Hubspot.com states that targeted CTAs convert 42 percent more visitors than untargeted CTAs. Along with the call to action, we can also help to customize the website to your requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1080\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h3>Build your website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we can customize the color, logo and overall style of a website to your needs. By working with our Support Team, you will be able to go over all functions of your website and any potential designs. It is important to note that while you can customize your website, there will be specific tools and structures that we implement for the overall functionality of the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">Hubspot.com found that placing an anchor text CTA on a page, increased the view-to-lead conversion rate of website visitors by 121 percent.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>We can identify the key location for a CTA and the other page content. An example of a smart CTA is to highlight a specific medical service or special on the page with similar content, such as a CTA about investing in dental implants on a dental implants page. Another example is highlighting a CTA with a deal for teeth whitening on a teeth whitening page. We can also provide slider images and text on the homepage based on your services and desires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since setting up an effective website can take some time, do not hesitate to give us a call for more information or to schedule a consultation.
