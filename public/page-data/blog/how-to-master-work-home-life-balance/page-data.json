While working from home has its benefits, especially in terms of productivity, not every business can benefit from this setup. In fact, dentists and medical practices are finding themselves in unique situations.</p>\r\n<p>This is where Doctor Genius can help. Our goal is to help you utilize a practice website and digital platform to maximize your reach online while also helping patients when needed and allowed. For instance, many patients are unsure of what constitutes a dental emergency. Along with that, there are constant developments with teledentistry.</p>\r\n<p>With teledentistry, dentists can provide consultations to patients via video and voice chat, while they remain in their homes. However, it is essential for dentists to establish a work-home-life balance.</p>\r\n<h2>Work-Home-Life Balance</h2>\r\n<p>The key to finding a balance between work and daily routine lies in time management. The following tips help with time management and communication to make the day more productive:</p>\r\n<h3>Plan activities adequately</h3>\r\n<p>Specify the time for work. An alternative might be to stay flexible and divide time between work responsibilities and other tasks. It is advisable to inform colleagues of working hours for better coordination of work hours yet ensure effective collaboration. Identify long and short-term goals and meet set deadlines.</p>\r\n<p>Our team at Doctor Genius can help to outline how dentists can adjust to this new work format, and learn how to balance the new schedules. In some cases, practices may offer emergency or immediate dental services for severe issues.</p>\r\n<h3>Work in a different area from the rest of the home</h3>\r\n<p>Designate an “office space” that is solely dedicated to working. The workspace should be clean and free of clutters to prevent distractions. Everyone in the house should know about this space, so they know not to disturb throughout work hours. If there are kids around, parents can explain to them that sitting on a particular desk on an area means work, and they should only come around for important things. Letting family members understand the need to respect work time and space will allow healthy boundaries, regardless of the size of the workspace.</p>\r\n<h3>Adopt office routines</h3>\r\n<p>Working from home can affect productivity. Therefore, one can stick to the same work structure that exists in the office setting, including meetings with colleagues over video conferencing tools. This encourages a healthy routine to ensure productivity and successful work completion. The communication tools can promote relationships with colleagues, reduce loneliness, and preserve the team spirit. It would help to document work progress and share it with the rest of the team.</p>\r\n<h3>Create time for breaks</h3>\r\n<p>Working from home can make it hard to divide time between personal matters and work. There should be time for breaks to increase productively. Such breaks can be dedicated to favorite tasks such as exercising, cooking, or reading. Planning such activities provides something to anticipate after work. Exercises and mental breaks are important for health and well-being during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn More About Doctor Genius</h2>\r\n<p>The tips above emphasize the importance of maintaining a level of discipline and structure as the day passes. By forming habits that promote effective time management and communication skills, you will be able to create a balance between your work and personal life. These routines might be hard to follow at first, but with persistence, you can make the remote work enjoyable while the COVID-19 pandemic lasts.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

For many parents who now have to work remotely, they may face additional challenges concentrating on work, and dealing with their kids as coronavirus disease continues to be a problem. Parents need to implement a setup that allows them to work undisturbed and keep everyone happy.</p>\r\n<h2>Maintaining a safe and happy WFH space</h2>\r\n<p>Here are five creative ways to work productively at home by keeping the Work-From-Home, WFH, space safe and happy:</p>\r\n<h3>Develop a schedule</h3>\r\n<p>Creating a strict schedule that is identical to a normal school day can be helpful. The kids will continue to wake up, eat, and get dressed as usual. Then they can stay busy with assignments. When they are engaged, parents can focus on getting their work done. During productive hours, the kids should be distracted with playtime.</p>\r\n<h3>Use technology</h3>\r\n<p>Provide toys for the kids to play with and set time for them to use technology, away from the work area. Kids love movies or computer time, so maximize that. Educational websites are available to improve a child&#8217;s creativity. When on a strict deadline, a new movie could work like a charm.</p>\r\n<h3>Use door signs</h3>\r\n<p>There should always be a private space, though; it could be the bedroom, closet, basement, guest room, or an area where one can have undisturbed quiet space. Separating the space makes drawing the line much easier. In the WFH space, there can be a sign on the door, so when they see the &#8220;stop&#8221; sign, they know not to come in unless there is something important going on. If the sign shows &#8220;enter,&#8221; then they can come in.</p>\r\n<h3>Set boundaries for the children</h3>\r\n<p>It is necessary to set boundaries for kids when working from home, especially if they are of school age. Parents can allow their kids to watch more TV and play games than usual to stay occupied. The kids need to understand that it is temporary, however. While they are at it, parents can tell them when they do not want to be disturbed. Even if there is no designated office space in the house, establishing clear boundaries with the kids can help.</p>\r\n<h3>Old-school activities</h3>\r\n<p>Before gadgets came around, puzzles and scrapbooking were the cool stuff. They can still work to keep children busy and keep the WFH space safe and happy while the COVID-19 lockdown lasts. These activities can be interesting, and more importantly, they tend to be time-consuming. So, encourage the kids to channel their inner craftmanship during workhours.</p>\r\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\r\n<p>It is normal for children to desire attention. If both parents are working from home, creating shifts can make remote work much easier. If a parent works early in the morning, their partner can wake up the kids and handle tasks around the house. Switching shifts will allow parents to work uninterruptedly throughout the day. If switching shifts between partners are not feasible, especially for those whose partners cannot work remotely during the COVID-19 crisis, creating a strict schedule and planning could help optimize the day.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

When it comes to dental practices, patients still need dental treatment, urgent services, and information on what constitutes a dental emergency. It is the same way with all forms of medical care.</p>\r\n<p>People are wondering how and when to reach out to medical professionals or businesses for how and when they can seek services. While the government is taking the time to iron out the details of re-opening the economy, medical practices can benefit from understanding what is going to happen and what the plan is for small businesses.</p>\r\n<h2>When and how to support local businesses</h2>\r\n<p>Local businesses play essential roles in the nation’s economy. Communities grow and experience more innovations due to local establishments by creating jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities and support the community. They care about the community making the town stand out among others.</p>\r\n<p>Such businesses are dealing with financial strain currently and face uncertainty about the future. The following are ways to support local businesses during the COVID-19 crisis:</p>\r\n<h3>Order from local stores</h3>\r\n<p>For those who can afford to, it would certainly help if they tried their local stores or restaurants first when they need to buy something. Many restaurants now offer pickups and deliveries. Other places like the local toy store, spas, hair salon, hardware store, and childcare provider may not be selling from their physical stores, but they could be offering delivery and curbside pickup options.</p>\r\n<p>Buy gift cards or credit for future use from them. Some of these local stores may have adjusted their services to meet up demands in this period. For instance, local cleaners may now offer disinfecting services, and the toy store may have added homeschool supplies. For those who still have the financial means, it might help to keep paying workers like the hairstylist, nanny, and cleaners. They are usually hit the hardest because fewer people will be requesting their services.</p>\r\n<h3>Avoid refunds and continue subscriptions</h3>\r\n<p>Check online to see if any of the services are now available online. Service providers like tutors, personal trainers, yoga instructors, financial planners, coaches, music teachers, and lawyers — all of them can continue to render their services online via videos or online conferencing.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to pay for memberships and subscriptions, even if the services have been stopped temporarily. If payment has been sent for a canceled class, one may consider donating the money to the organization instead of requesting a refund. Alternatively, one can postpone booked services to a later date instead of canceling.</p>\r\n<h3>Share the services online</h3>\r\n<p>If a local business is offering special promotions or ideas, sharing it online might help increase its reach. Since local businesses do not often have great marketing efforts, their customers can help them share the news over social media. Those who are website designers, developers, or social media experts can render their services to local businesses without an online presence to promote their deals and sales online.</p>\r\n<h3>Give tips</h3>\r\n<p>When ordering takeaway goods from local restaurants, try to be more generous than usual, if possible. The extra funds, no matter how little, can help businesses and their staff who still have to work, as well as delivery people who typically work on a contract basis and have unstable wages.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us To Learn More Today</h2>\r\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and self-isolating rules are critical for curbing the spread of the disease but devastating for local businesses.
