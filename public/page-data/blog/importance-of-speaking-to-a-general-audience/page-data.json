In fact, according to HubSpot, more businesses actively invest in <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">online content creation</a> (70%) than those that invest in search engine marketing strategies (64%). Because so many brands focus on content creation, the online landscape is more saturated with content than ever before. To break through all the noise and ensure your brand comes out on top, you need to take a deep dive into your audience’s habits and behaviors to gain a better understanding of the type of content it really wants to see.</p>\r\n<h2>Top 3 reasons to tailor your online content to your general audience</h2>\r\n<p>In the early days of content marketing, brands used content simply as a means of funneling leads to their sites. Rarely did brands focus on filling their landing pages with quality and helpful content. While this tactic may have worked way back when, it will not fly today. Today, speaking to one’s general audience is more important to online success than ever. Below are the top three reasons this is true.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Identify more appropriate keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Though SEO takes a backseat to targeted content, there is still value in keyword research and placement. After all, if you do not use the right keywords, you will struggle to reach your target audience. While an SEO agency can help you perform thorough keyword research, a large part of <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/key-prosperous-practiceare-using-effective-keywords/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/key-prosperous-practiceare-using-effective-keywords/\">identifying appropriate terms and phrases</a> entails knowing your audience.  </p>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/audiences-vs-keywords/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/audiences-vs-keywords/\">Neil Patel</a>, the best way for brands to sabotage their content marketing strategy is to target everyone. By targeting everyone, brands attract no one. Instead, companies should seek to understand what words and phrases their unique audiences use to search for their products and services. In doing so, they may limit the number of searches in which they show up, but they increase their odds of showing up in searches conducted by more serious leads.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Increase engagement</h3>\r\n<p>Attracting leads to your website is only half the battle. The other half entails engaging visitors enough to convince them to do business with you. If your visitors do not care about what you have to say, it is highly unlikely they will care about what you have to sell. The best way to engage audiences is to identify their unique pain points, wants, and concerns, and craft content around those.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Build relationships</h3>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most important reason to speak to your general audience is to build relationships and brand loyalty. Remember, online competition is fierce. For consumers, supply is not the problem. The problem lies in deciding in which brand to place one’s loyalty.</p>\r\n<p>Set your business apart from the competition by communicating with your audience on an intimate and authentic level. Though doing so will require considerably more effort than merely pumping out generic content, your efforts will pay off, as defined audiences are quicker to dedicate their loyalty because they feel as though they are truly appreciated.</p>\r\n<h2>Start defining your target audience today</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is ranked No. 1 in new patient acquisitions for a reason: We understand the health care industry, the digital realm, and patients’ wants and expectations.

Content that is optimized specifically for mobile users is a vital addition to the marketing plan of businesses in every industry. </p>\r\n<h2>Reaching mobile users through mobile marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Finding innovative ways to reach mobile users is not just a short-lived marketing trend. To remain competitive in a generation of mobile-focused consumers, businesses and health care practices must continuously rethink online strategies. </p>\r\n<h3>Mobile optimization</h3>\r\n<p>In the past, businesses focused on webpages that would likely be viewed on a computer. Building an option for the mobile view was secondary and, in most cases, did not include the same amount of information, often requiring the customer to view the full site for more material and additional details. Users want a mobile site that loads quickly, offers easy navigation, is pleasing to the eye, and provides engaging content. This makes it important to check back frequently for mobile site errors and review for user-friendliness using test groups. </p>\r\n<h3>Search engine optimization keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that when building a mobile-optimized site, SEO keywords are still just as crucial as on a traditional website. Since most Google searches are now completed on mobile devices, the Google Webmaster Central Blog reports that the <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html\">search engine indexing</a> system has evolved to prioritize these searches. Whereas website users are willing to browse through several options in the search queue, mobile users rarely select options beyond the first few that become available. This trend in preference makes SEO keyword selection and use more vital than ever. </p>\r\n<h3>Voice command popularity</h3>\r\n<p>Mobile users are no longer relying solely on text and images to gain information. The rising popularity in voice command technology has made SEO keyword usage a priority for mobile site design. When users activate voice command and make a request, the keywords are analyzed and search results index accordingly. Making sure related keywords are present on the mobile site or app means a higher likelihood of coming up on that index. </p>\r\n<h3>App design and utilization</h3>\r\n<p>For some mobile users, an optimized site is not enough to stay engaged. Repeat customers benefit from the development of an app that is user-friendly and interactive. Along with an app that stands out, the integration of SEO keywords using terminology that is specifically reserved for apps increases the likelihood of the app coming up in a search. App store optimization keywords are a new frontier that many businesses are just now learning to explore, so during the design process, it helps to research the ASO keywords most frequently used in the specific business field. </p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about mobile marketing for your business</h2>\r\n<p>Flexibility in your marketing techniques is essential for maintaining relevance with your target audience as technology rapidly changes.

But when you step<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When your practice struggles financially, the initial urge might be to reduce costs, including marketing expenditures. But when you step back and view your practice more objectively within the broader economic conditions, you might recognize the need for a more thoughtful strategy and a different approach. Historical trends provide lessons to medical practices seeking ways to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on their bottom line. Winners happened to be those businesses and practices that went against the current, either maintain marketing expenditures or increasing them. Therefore, your medical practice&#8217;s key to successfully emerging from the recession is continued investments in marketing and, more significantly today, digital marketing.</p>\r\n<h2>Cyclical Nature of the Economy</h2>\r\n<p>Over time, a country&#8217;s economic activity experiences periods of expansion and contraction. Determining which stage an economy is in requires analysis of the gross domestic product (GDP), national rates of employment, level of retail sales, and amount of personal income. Business cycles progress through a set pattern, but the length of each phase in this pattern varies. These cycles are demarcated by periods of economic expansion and contraction: also referred to as peaks and troughs, respectively. Historically, U.S. business cycles average about six years.</p>\r\n<p>Closely tracking the trends in cycles reveals that there are six stages an economy goes through.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Expansion</em></h3>\r\n<p>During the expansion period, employment levels, business profits, wages, and overall demand and supply are high. The money supply moves continuously and uninterrupted. Consumer confidence is high, and so is spending.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Peak</em></h3>\r\n<p>At some point, the economy reaches its maximum growth level, known as the peak.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Recession</em></h3>\r\n<p>At the end of the peak, a recession begins, and economic activity shrinks. Recessions typically experience high unemployment, negative economic growth, fewer sales as consumer demand declines, stagnation or drop in income, and less production output.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Depression</em></h3>\r\n<p>Depression furthers the declines of recession, with significant decreases in employment, investment, production, and consumer confidence.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Trough</em></h3>\r\n<p>The trough represents the lowest point in the economy.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Recovery</em></h3>\r\n<p>The recovery phase begins the improvement in the economy, as economic activity begins to increase. Low prices contribute to increased levels of demand, and production and employment levels start to rise. Investment, confidence, and spending also start to increase. This is the final stage of a complete business cycle.</p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The economy predictably experiences ups and downs as it progresses through multiple stages: expansion, peak, recession, depression, trough, and recovery.</li>\r\n\t<li>These stages make a complete business cycle.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Signs of Economic Recession</h2>\r\n<p>In the United States, the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/cycles/june2020.html\">National Bureau of Economic Research</a> (NBER) maintains a chronology of business cycles. The NBER tracks various indicators every month to determine the economy&#8217;s point in the business cycle. According to the NBER, the United States entered the beginning of a recession in March 2020, based on the significant decline in economic activity throughout the economy, including record-level unemployment and a sharp drop in industrial production.</p>\r\n<p>The peak in the U.S. economy&#8217;s monthly economic activity occurred in February, marking the end of a 128-month period that was the longest expansion in the history of U.S. business cycles.</p>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 public health emergency inspired a decline in employment and production of unprecedented magnitude that reaches across the entire economy. This recession has different dynamics than prior recessions, due to the pandemic, and might last for a briefer time. But the disease&#8217;s progression, governmental responses to the pandemic, and individual behaviors cannot be known with any certainty. What is known is that the expansion stage is an economy&#8217;s normal state, with most recessions brief, lasting from six months to a year or two.</p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The United States entered a recession, fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Marketing Spending During a Recession</h2>\r\n<p>When a recession begins, overall spending tends to shrink. Businesses&#8217; finances start to suffer. Thus, to balance less revenue, the budgets begin to allocate less spending. Perks and plans for expansion are among the first areas that a company cuts, along with marketing. <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/what-marketers-and-agencies-might-expect-if-recession-happens/2195251\">Ad spending dropped</a> about 12% in 2009, the last year of the most recent recession. Some experts estimate that <a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/mark-ritson-marketing-spend-recession-coronavirus/\">ad spend likely will shrink by 30 to 60</a>% through 2020. A survey of marketers found that <a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/marketing-campaigns-delays-rise-coronavirus/\">90% either are delaying or revising their marketing budgets</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Most business managers tend to believe that spending funds on marketing efforts during a time when customers are spending less just cuts into profits. In the short term, this could be accurate. Reducing marketing spending in a recession might protect immediate profits, but only briefly. But neglecting marketing during an economic downturn results in a weakened brand and fewer profits post-recession.</p>\r\n<p>Savvy business owners realize that marketing expenditures have the potential to contribute to profits in the longer term. The evidence clearly and consistently shows that it pays to maintain or even increase investments in marketing during an economic downturn. The rationale is that while others reduce their spending on marketing, there is a greater opportunity to have a share of voice when competitors go silent. Expert marketing consultants often teach their clients to actually increase advertising spending during recessions to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2019/09/05/when-a-recession-comes-dont-stop-advertising/#3675901a4608\">take advantage of the lower cost.</a> </p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Most businesses reduce marketing spending during economic downturns, though continuing or increasing marketing would be better for the long term.</li>\r\n\t<li>Increasing spending can help increase awareness and take advantage of cheaper marketing costs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Counter-Cyclical Strategy for Advertising and Marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Most people and businesses follow a pro-cyclical approach to spending and investment. Their behaviors correspond with the stage of the business cycle. For example, when there is economic expansion and prosperity, many individuals and companies will engage in behavior that falls in line with that growth and serves to extend the period. Consumers buy more things, and companies invest more in areas like marketing. During an economic recession, the majority pro-cyclically cut their spending and reduce their investments.</p>\r\n<p>A counter-cyclical strategy does not cut spending during times of economic contraction, and businesses that use a counter-cyclical strategy are more likely to survive. (At Doctor Genius, we follow a counter-cyclical strategy.) A century of research supports this approach. For example, a <a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/when-the-going-gets-tough-the-tough-dont-skimp-on-their-ad-budgets/\">McGraw-Hill Research study</a> examined 600 companies from 1980 to 1985. The businesses that maintained or increased their level of advertising expenditures during the recession experienced significantly higher sales when the economy recovered than companies that decreased ad spending. Specifically, aggressive advertisers during the recession had sales 256% higher than the companies that chose not to advertise.</p>\r\n<p>A few examples follow.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Kellogg&#8217;s triumph over Post</em></h3>\r\n<p>Post entered the Great Depression as the category leader in the <a href=\"https://spinsucks.com/communication/what-kelloggs-and-the-great-depression-can-teach-you-about-pr-and-marketing/\">ready-to-eat cereal market</a>. During the depression, Post significantly cut its advertising budget while Kellogg&#8217;s followed a counter-cyclical approach, doubling its advertising spend. Kellogg&#8217;s heavily invested in radio advertisements and introduced a new cereal, Rice Krispies. Kellogg&#8217;s overtook Post as the category leader, growing its profits by 30%.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Toyota&#8217;s rise to the top imported carmaker</em></h3>\r\n<p>The energy crisis triggered a 17-month recession from 1973-75. Toyota&#8217;s sales of its fuel-efficient cars were strong, but the company resisted the temptation to reduce its ad budget when the economic downturn came. By 1976, <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/news/ten-things-learn-70s-recession/131670\">Toyota surpassed all competitors</a> to become the top imported carmaker in the United States.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Target&#8217;s recession success</em></h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2010/03/roaring-out-of-recession\">Harvard Business Review</a> analyzed the strategies and corporate performance of thousands of companies during three global recessions, finding only about 9% flourished after a slowdown in terms of sales and profits growth. These companies balanced cutting costs to survive the recession and investing for the post-recession. The companies most successful after the recession focused more on operational efficiency improvements and spent more on marketing, research and development, and new assets.</p>\r\n<p>One example of a company that successfully balanced short-term needs with long-term planning is Target. Target responded to the 2000 recession with a reduction in its operating costs, narrowing distribution margins, and a 20% increase in its sales and marketing budget. The company&#8217;s sales grew by 40% over the course of the recession, and its profit margin increased to 10% in the three years after the recession.</p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A counter-cyclical strategy does not cut spending during a recession.</li>\r\n\t<li>Research from several recessions in U.S. history demonstrates that companies following a counter-cyclical approach to marketing are more likely to succeed than competitors who cut advertising spending.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Why a Counter-Cyclical Marketing Strategy Works</h2>\r\n<p>A counter-cyclical approach that increases marketing spending during a downturn makes sense and is effective for several reasons.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Gain market voice and market share</em></h3>\r\n<p>A recession provides opportunities to gain market share and market leadership. Businesses that maintain their marketing budget while competitors cut theirs automatically increase their share of voice. Share of voice leads to gaining market share and long-term benefits. Additionally, your message is more likely to be heard when fewer competitors advertise. You can <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">amplify your online presence</a> and market voice through several means, which Doctor Genius can help you utilize.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Keep brand current in consumer minds.</em></h3>\r\n<p>Maintaining or increasing marketing efforts keeps your company in the forethought of consumers. When purchase decisions are made, a customer is more likely to choose your brand, since it is more easily remembered in consumer minds.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Retain brand loyalty.</em></h3>\r\n<p>The primary source of cash flow and practice growth is a loyal customer base. Developing and then maintaining a strong brand, one that patients recognize and trust, is one of the best ways to minimize business risk. Continued marketing outreach even during an economic downturn works to keep loyal customers.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Convey confidence and stability.</em></h3>\r\n<p>When consumers observe a company that continues to advertise during a down economy, the impression usually made is of a stable and confident company. Business decision-makers feel more positive about that company&#8217;s commitment to its products and services. </p>\r\n<h3><em>Increase relative spending.</em></h3>\r\n<p>During a recession, the cost of advertising space falls, the battle to appear in search results becomes less aggressive, and fewer companies invest in a good SEO content strategy. Even if your marketing spending remains the same, your relative spending will increase. You will get more advertising distribution, with less competition. A recession is a good time to invest in marketing because you get more for your money.</p>\r\n<p>A cyclical approach, in which the business cuts marketing costs in economic recessions, damages the business&#8217;s long-term chances for success. Not advertising decreases brand awareness, lowers search result rankings, and diminishes brand loyalty. These are very expensive to regain once lost, especially once the economy recovers and competition again increases.</p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Counter-cyclical marketing investment brings a greater share of voice and market share, builds brand recognition and loyalty, conveys confidence, and increases the amount of relative spending.</li>\r\n\t<li>Cyclical marketing weakens a company&#8217;s market position and makes regaining that position after the recession more challenging and more expensive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Marketing Steps to Take During a Recession</h2>\r\n<p>Spending alone does not bring benefits. Rather, the spending must be strategic. Benefits come to the practices that are responsive to the market fluctuations and changes in their patients&#8217; circumstances and behaviors.</p>\r\n<p>During the COVID-19 crisis, patients&#8217; daily activities have changed, and so too must medical practices. Small offices&#8217; marketing strategies must adapt to changes in circumstances and behaviors. For example, as the majority of Americans sheltered in place with limited physical interactions, the reliance on virtual networks grew. More and more people are spending greater amounts of time in front of a screen. Conventional marketing tactics will not work in unconventional times. To reach your patients, you need to go where they are spending much of their time: online.</p>\r\n<p>Help your patients find you online by following some <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">fundamentals of digital marketing</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Focus on gaining social media presence and engagement.</li>\r\n\t<li>Create videos useful to your patients and potential patients.</li>\r\n\t<li>Improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of your website and blog.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Adjust your SEO strategies. To more easily be found during online searches, your practice requires good SEO practices that are up-to-date to reflect not only Google&#8217;s<a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\"> changes in its ranking algorithms</a> but your patients&#8217; and potential patients&#8217; shifting needs.</p>\r\n<p>During a recession, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2009/04/how-to-market-in-a-downturn-2\">consumer spending and priorities shift</a>. You need to recognize the changes in your patients&#8217; interests and intentions, and you must adjust your marketing strategies and messaging. The pandemic behind the recession further complicates efforts, adding an additional layer of concerns and considerations.</p>\r\n<p>One should also increase the frequency of posts and the range of content published. As Nielson reports, <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/covid-19-tracking-the-impact-on-media-consumption/\">time online has increased by 215%</a>. This is true despite a reported decrease in online marketing by traditional retails. In other words, this means that there is an opportunity to increase one&#8217;s share of voice during this downturn that has the capacity to reap demonstrable growth. As we&#8217;ve reported on during previous blogs, our clients have seen record highs in views. Clients at our higher tiers have seen this effect amplified as they post content more frequently and in a wider breadth of formats. </p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Having a marketing plan that bolsters the frequency and category of content during this time can improve ranking substantially during the COVID recession.</li>\r\n\t<li>Your marketing budget should remain the same or increase during the recession.</li>\r\n\t<li>Your practice needs digital marketing, including social media and website with an SEO focus.</li>\r\n\t<li>Understand how patients&#8217; priorities have shifted and adjust marketing accordingly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is the digital marketing and software company that can help medical and dental practices get an edge over competitors.
