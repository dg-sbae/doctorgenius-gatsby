When that person leaves without<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/techniques-for-reducing-bounce-rate/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When people visit your website, you want them to stay for as long as possible. When that person leaves without exploring the site past the page originally clicked on, this is called a bounce. The bounce rate is calculated based on the number of people who exit your webpage before clicking on any of your other pages. The more people who leave prematurely, the higher your website’s bounce rate is.</p>\r\n<p>Higher bounce rates are bad for business because they mean fewer visitors are converting. Converting can involve completing any number of actions, such as sending a digital message, filling out the newsletter signup form, or buying a product. By decreasing bounce rate, you can increase your audience and business.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to reduce bounce rate</h2>\r\n<p>A great bounce rate is around 30-50%, while a poor bounce rate can land above 80%. You can view your overall bounce rate and the bounce rate of specific pages on Google Analytics or another <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close\">analytic alternative</a>. Identifying which pages have the highest rate on your website can give you a specific area to focus on instead of trying to rework the content design and SEO strategy of your entire site at once. Here are changes you can make to a page to decrease bounce rate.</p>\r\n<h3>Make content easier to read</h3>\r\n<p>Large blocks of text are much harder to digest than text that is broken up and formatted to please the eye. Using subheadings, bullet points, images, charts, and occasional bolded keywords can make it easier for people to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">scan your content</a> and find links to other pages. If you have various types of pages (blogs, articles, contact pages, etc.), create style guides for each that make sure all posts adhere to the right format and are easier to read.  </p>\r\n<h3>Employ strong calls to action</h3>\r\n<p>Experiment with calls to action to see what attracts readers to click on services you offer and engage more with your site. Some may stand stronger above the rest, and you may find that others do not receive as much attention. By establishing a powerful call to action, you entice visitors to sign up for newsletters and explore more parts of your site.</p>\r\n<h3>Improve usability</h3>\r\n<p>Your site should be appealing from the first second a visitor lands on it. Anything that looks clunky, jarring, or confusing is likely to lose newcomers quickly, and in an age when online attention spans last mere seconds, creating a captivating hook is essential. Double-check that your site is easy to navigate and that finding information is not a hassle. Your site should also be able to translate smoothly from any device and screen size. A majority of users browse the internet on a mobile device, so the last thing you want is a site that looks terrible on a small screen.</p>\r\n<h2>Reach out for more great ideas</h2>\r\n<p>Every website is different, and the creation of user-friendly, attractive pages should be tailored to individual business needs. Discover new ways to improve your site’s aesthetic and minimize bounce rate, and <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">contact us</a> to see how to change your site to fit the latest marketing trends.   </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

These terms cover different aspects of using search engines to gain visibility online and guide patients to your website, where they hopefully make the choice to learn more about your services.

While it is common for businesses to pay for someone to handle the SEO of a website, this method relies entirely on free, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\">organic strategies</a>. There are several essential components that affect how well a site is optimized for search engines:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keyword optimization: </strong>Choosing the right keywords and phrases and utilizing them effectively is the most important part of on-page SEO. This involves performing keyword research, considering placement of words, and creating content.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Backlinking:</strong> One way to efficiently boost your site’s reputation is by including backlinks to other trustworthy sources throughout your content. You should also manage any other sites that link to your page and consider disavowing any questionable sources.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Crawlability: </strong>A high-functioning backend is also important for SEO. Having a site map, ensuring the server is secure, and hosting pages that load quickly all contribute to the technical crawlability of the site.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>What is SEM?</h3>\r\n<p>Rather than rely on organic content to boost your office’s website, you can also include search engine marketing in your strategy. This practice uses paid advertisements to make a site more visible on search engines.</p>\r\n<p>SEM often refers to paid-per-click advertising, which means you are only charged for the ad if the patient clicks on it. However, like SEO, keyword research is essential for ensuring a large number of high-quality leads encounter the ad.</p>\r\n<h2>How to utilize both SEO in and SEM in a campaign</h2>\r\n<p>Most marketing campaigns benefit from using a combination of SEO and SEM. Knowing how much to use of each depends on your budget, current goals, industry, and website performance.</p>\r\n<p>For new offices with the primary goal of gaining brand awareness and visibility, SEM offers immediate results. Even if the website is not optimized, it can still gain visibility while you finetune those details. If keywords are very competitive for your industry, PPC ads make it easier to appear on the search engine ranking page than it would with SEO.</p>\r\n<p>However, SEO offers long-lasting results that are not limited by a temporary ad. For well-established brands with quality organic content and a strong website, improving SEO has notable benefits.</p>\r\n<h2>Take your marketing efforts to the next level</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand how SEM and SEO work together to make a marketing campaign successful.

More practices are moving toward this approach to retain current patients and establish relationships with new ones. By designating a specific area of your site to communicate with patients, you are increasing beneficial information flow between your business and patients while improving your SEO strategies. To take full advantage of your website, you must understand the various forms of communication you can implement and how to optimize usage.  </p>\r\n<h2>Communication options</h2>\r\n<p>There are many ways you can communicate daily with patients. In fact, offering an online communication service usually opens your business up to optimal 24/7 service for anyone who needs help. It also provides more <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\">access to mobile users</a>, who make up about half of all online interactions. You can incorporate more than one of these options into your site to increase accessibility.</p>\r\n<h3>Online messaging</h3>\r\n<p>Those familiar with social media will know that online messaging is a common form of communication across apps and websites. Almost all banks, law offices, and online stores have turned to online messaging to quickly and concisely interact with customers. You can create a segment in the sidebar of your website or a popup message window that allows visitors to send a message immediately — whichever your site architecture accommodates. By putting a place for messages at the forefront of your site, you provide an easy and effective route for customers to reach you.</p>\r\n<h3>Email</h3>\r\n<p>With so many other communication options available today, it can be easy to think that emails are going out of style. This is far from true, and many companies actually generate a large amount of business through a regularly scheduled email newsletter. While many people may not yet be familiar or comfortable with online messaging, emails are simple and reliable. Extra security measures may be needed to ensure patient privacy to help patients and physicians feel more at ease. Overall, email is cost-effective, and you can include your address on a contact information page on your site for customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Integrated online messaging</h3>\r\n<p>Similar to regular online messaging, the integrated system goes a step further to include patient information for the physician during a live communication. A physician can view the patient’s medical record while talking to them, and all messages automatically become a part of the patient’s record as the conversation progresses. This gives patients necessary connectivity while providing physicians with the tools for a successful engagement.</p>\r\n<h2>Why online communication matters</h2>\r\n<p>Many people, especially those of younger generations, feel more comfortable communicating via online sources than over the phone. Broadening the number of opportunities patients have to connect with you makes it easier to accommodate different schedules and lifestyles. Of course, simply having an online communication system is not enough — you still need to incorporate an <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2017/02/09/how-to-build-strong-customer-relationships-online/#57f492341295\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2017/02/09/how-to-build-strong-customer-relationships-online/#57f492341295\">inviting personal touch</a> to make a human connection even though the interaction is through a screen.</p>\r\n<h2>Reach out for a greater understanding of online communication</h2>\r\n<p>Never let a lack of knowledge about online tactics prevent you from getting the most out of your website. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for more insights on expanding your online audience and generating engaging content to increase communication with your patients.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
