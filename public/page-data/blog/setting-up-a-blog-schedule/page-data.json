Blogging has transformed from a niche hobby to an essential marketing strategy that companies successfully use to engage current consumers and draw in new traffic. However, simply creating a blog is not enough. Developing an effective and beneficial blog requires constant management, SEO tactics, new content, and adaptations to current trends.</p>\r\n<h2>Key steps to increase blog credibility</h2>\r\n<p>With so much bad information only a click away, more and more consumers are searching for sites that have been proven to be trustworthy and credible. Consumers want to know that a blog is offering dependable content with fresh ideas regularly (that are, of course, entertaining and appealing to read). Here are key steps to focus on to build credibility and reach more viewers.  </p>\r\n<h3>Post regularly</h3>\r\n<p>Blogging regularly is a must if you want to stay in your industry’s top contenders. Consumers constantly crave new content, and generating professional, helpful blog posts on a regularly maintained schedule is one of the easiest ways to develop a trusting relationship with them. The more reliable content a blog produces, the faster it will build an audience — a crucial step for many businesses trying to get off the ground. Many consumers have a sharp eye for a live site, and it is usually obvious when a site has not been updated recently, which can bring reliability into question. Posting regularly also helps build a site’s <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-eat-misconceptions/333875/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-eat-misconceptions/333875/\">E-A-T</a>, or Expertise, Authority, and Trust, which is a tool Google uses to identify and promote proven trustworthy blogs.</p>\r\n<h3>Use hyperlinks and backlinks</h3>\r\n<p>Hyperlinks create a hidden web of connectivity within the blogging world. By hyperlinking information in one post to another creator’s content, you are building connections with that creator. Hyperlinking can also develop your site’s credibility, so long as you are using <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/\">reliable sources</a>. On the other hand, backlinks are also beneficial in connecting other sites to your own, and they can help your site perform better in search engine results.</p>\r\n<h3>Include keywords</h3>\r\n<p>In brief, search engine optimization is a practice that broadens a site’s audience by bringing new consumers to it naturally through a search engine. When a consumer types certain keywords into Google, the top results contain those words. This is why incorporating keywords into each post is crucial. Your post, and therefore your website, is more likely to be discovered if it includes occasional keywords that might get entered into a search engine. Using them in the content, taglines, and tags of a post will make it easier for consumers to find.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about building a successful blog</h2>\r\n<p>There are many other detailed ways to gain more credibility for your business through successful blogging.

People are in need of quality health care that is compatible with their current insurance plan, perhaps more than ever in recent history. In addition, now is the ideal time to encourage both current and potential patients to prioritize health and wellness through routine care and the prompt diagnoses of illnesses and developing conditions. As a result, dental and medical practices may need to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\">adjust website content</a> to bring those potential clients through the front door.</p>\r\n<h2>The problem with incomplete insurance information</h2>\r\n<p>When a prospective patient begins searching for a new health care provider, browsing websites is often a starting point. While there may be several factors that influence the decision to make an appointment, patients ultimately need to know that your office accepts their current insurance plan. Your site may offer stunning visuals, excellent content, and stellar reviews. However, if you are missing this key component in the patient&#8217;s decision-making process, you could be losing numerous potential clients. Individuals searching for something new will likely be tempted to keep searching until they find the answers they need.</p>\r\n<h2>The benefits of adding insurance listings to your site</h2>\r\n<p>If you want to bring more patients to your practice, providing a complete, up-to-date list of accepted insurance plans is a good place to start. This eliminates wasted time on both ends, preventing the patient from enduring inconvenient wait times just to get the answer to a simple &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; question. At the same time, your office personnel can avoid the hassle of unnecessary phone calls and stay on task with other responsibilities. When your website provides the patient with all of the essential information up front, the need to continue the search is significantly reduced, if not eliminated altogether.</p>\r\n<h3>Counting on customer loyalty</h3>\r\n<p>The insurance plans and policies you choose to accept will change from year to year based on your business&#8217;s needs. Fortunately, keeping updated insurance listings on your website can help you hold onto devoted patients in spite of a potential drop in coverage. For many people, loyalty to a particular doctor, dentist, or office is far more important than loyalty to the current insurance company. When you combine an atmosphere of <a href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/early/2020/08/10/bjgp20X712349\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/early/2020/08/10/bjgp20X712349\">trust and respect</a> with quality care, there is a good chance your patients will be willing to make things work.</p>\r\n<p>By providing access to this useful information, you can also enable patients to switch plans during open enrollment or a <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/\">major life change</a> to join or stay with your office. In addition, those who are simply shopping for new coverage can be influenced based on the plans your office accepts, especially if it appears to be a good fit for the patient.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you improve your company website</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we are committed to helping health care professionals reach more clients by improving their website and online presence.

Relying on the same generic pictures that everyone else in your industry is using can reflect poorly on your company. By focusing on appealing to more users with unique, eye-catching photos, you have a better chance at ranking higher on search engines and improving your overall SEO. Learn how to take your digital marketing efforts a step further by including pictures of your office on your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Knowing when to use stock or original photos</h2>\r\n<p>While using unique imagery throughout your company website would be ideal for most effectively branding your company, it is not always practical to include an original photograph every time you need an image on a page. If you&#8217;re using a mix of stock and personal photos on your site, it is important you know when it is acceptable to use stock photos and when you should use a photographer.</p>\r\n<h3>When to use stock photos</h3>\r\n<p>Stock photos can easily be found online and may be free or sold for a low price, depending on the site you use. Some of these photos are very high-quality, effective photographs and can be used for your ads and campaigns in situations where you need to save money and get the image out right away. While these photos may be professional quality, most people can tell the image came from a stock image site, so use these sparingly. </p>\r\n<h3>When to use original photos</h3>\r\n<p>Original photos are images that you produce in-house by either taking your own pictures or hiring a professional photographer. Using your own pictures is most essential when you are trying to create a personal connection with your patients and show them the faces behind your company. By including pictures of staff members and using real photos of your office throughout the website, your potential patients get to know you better and are more likely to choose to use your services with you as a result.</p>\r\n<h2>Making your images SEO friendly</h2>\r\n<p>While it is almost always better to use your own images on your site, you still need to pay attention to how they are being used to have the best ranking. For the best SEO results, keep the following tips in mind:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Use images on every page, including with every blog post</li>\r\n\t<li>Place images near the text it applies to</li>\r\n\t<li>Give the photo a unique name that matches the subject matter</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduce the file size by compressing it without compromising quality</li>\r\n\t<li>Consider the format of the photo and how you plan to use it</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure your images are compatible with mobile devices</li>\r\n\t<li>Resize the image to the appropriate size</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Make the biggest impact on future patients</h2>\r\n<p>Patients choose medical providers they can trust, which is why using original photos that let your patients get to know you better is so beneficial.
