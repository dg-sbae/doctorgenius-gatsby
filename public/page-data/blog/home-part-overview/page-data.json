You want the user experience to be positive and beneficial enough that the individual does not leave the website. While it is fairly easy to build a homepage, it is much more difficult to determine what one needs to put on that homepage and where. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Presentation and representation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While many medical professionals may assume that they do not need a website and rely on word of mouth or reviews on platforms such as Yelp!, a website can reach many more potential patients. Not only expanding a medical professional’s reach, a website can also help to create a platform for patient-professional conversation. However, the content on a home page can make or break a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a home page is too difficult to navigate or does not explain what the professional does in an effective way, then the potential patient is most likely to search elsewhere. Here are a few key factors Doctor Genius implements into a client’s homepage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Navigation bar</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An important tool for any website, a navigation bar is crucial for helping people find what they need. While there will be ads and content on the homepage that may direct the user, the user may be interested in a service that is not the medical professional’s main one. We can customize tabs for various services and information for an easier user experience. This way, the user will not leave a website due to confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-968\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Calls to action</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A home page needs at least one call to action but will benefit from several. Since most medical practices cover multiple procedures, highlighting specific services in these procedures can be extremely beneficial for the professional. Website users will then be able to see specific services immediately upon using the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Curatti.com states that 70 percent of small business websites do not have clear calls-to-action on their homepage.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Images</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having images to support the written content will help give a clear indication of the services. Along with that, the images can help create a style for the website and capture the emotion that patients feel after using the service. Images also promote presentation of the homepage. At Doctor Genius, we place images in crucial locations to help tie the text with a visual cue to reach the reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Location, location, location</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can also help ensure that all necessary information is above the fold. Meaning that when a client first views the homepage, all necessary information is there. We also focus on the placement of information based on users’ habit of reading left to right. With this in mind, we utilize the “Z-pattern,” to help highlight the most crucial areas of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

There are several reasons why proper presentation for a website can bring in new patients or push them away, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Fully-functional website</li>\r\n \t<li>Mobile-first website</li>\r\n \t<li>Relevant content and background information</li>\r\n \t<li>Links to reviews</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are only a few of the necessary tools a website will need. When a patient is searching for a new doctor, dentist or other medical practice, a strong website can provide an accurate depiction of the professional services available. Without a stable and effective website, potential patients will look elsewhere for the care they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fully-functional website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a survey on Mashable.com, they measure the general health care trends for patients online. One statistic displays that 69 percent of parents will seek medical answers on WebMD instead of contacting a real doctor, while 40 percent will search Wikipedia, 22 percent on Facebook and 20 percent on YouTube. With the internet being such a popular platform for people seeking medical advice, your website can be a source of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is great to have information on a website, it is important to have a website that actually works properly. At Doctor Genius, we will run continual maintenance on the website and post content on a regular basis to ensure that the website is actively reaching new patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Statistic Image 1\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-975\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile-first website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The technology in smartphones continues to evolve and allow people to accomplish more with such a small device. In fact, Demi &amp; Cooper Advertising and DC Interactive Group find that 19 percent of smartphone users have at least one health app on their phone. While an app may not be as useful for a medical practice, having a mobile-friendly website can. Since most people use their phone or tablet devices to use Facebook, Instagram, search the internet and send emails, there is a high chance that they will look up medical professionals on those devices as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mobile-first website will change the architecture of the web pages to match the screen of the device. This way, when people search for your website on their phone, it will adapt and display everything properly instead of cutting off pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Relevant content and background information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with the client to cover all of their relevant background information and content to advertise their services. By including this information, potential patients receive a trust signal in knowing that the medical professional has relevant information on a fully-functional website. This information also promotes starting a conversation about the patient’s health needs with the professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Links to reviews</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By including patient reviews on the website, people will not have to search elsewhere and can clearly see what people enjoyed about your medical services. We can also link to these websites for patients to see more reviews and vice versa. People will find the reviews online and visit the website. Thus, this system draws in more patients from across the web to your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

The crucial aspect of content marketing is the rate of published content for a website. The content rate will help keep a website active and up on the front lines of search results. While the quality of content is important, the rate of content is just as important.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keep it running</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Active content that holds some form of relevance for the website can help to bring in more traffic. In 2015, Ascend2 found that 72 percent of marketers agreed that relevant content creation was the most effective content strategy. While quality is still crucial to promoting a website, there needs to be a steady flow of content. Posting a blog once every few months will not be effective. We can post multiple blogs a month on your website and promote them through social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Software engineer, author, and founder of WanderlustWorker.com wrote in a Forbes article that “in the beginning, Google doesn&#8217;t trust you,” adding, “If Google doesn&#8217;t trust you, you&#8217;re not going to rank on those lucrative first-page SERPs*. You&#8217;ll be lost in the fray amidst millions of others who&#8217;re trying to claw their way to the top.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that people cannot take shortcuts in posting content on a website. “Thin content with errors, or duplicate content and spun content can really hurt you,” Adams explains. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can provide clients with effective content that reaches potential patients on the website and on other social media platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Branching out to other platforms</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Branching Out Into SOcial Media\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-959\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">HubSpot found in 2016 that for the previous two years, content consumption on Facebook had increased by 57 percent.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If online content is one thing, it is versatile. Online content can branch out to multiple platforms of social media that all lead back to the client’s website. By utilizing social media platforms to share content on a website, Doctor Genius can help clients gain increased website traffic. In 2016, HubSpot also found that 76 percent of people use their Facebook feed to find interesting content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius will not only post engaging content onto your website, but we will also create posts for social media accounts that lead patients to your website. This way, potential patients will find a post about your practice in their social media feed that can lead them back to your website.
