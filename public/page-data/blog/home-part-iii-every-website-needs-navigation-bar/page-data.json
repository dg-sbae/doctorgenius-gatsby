When you visit a website without a menu or navigation bar, it pushes you to search other websites as it becomes too difficult to find the information you need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Easy use for a longer visit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A navigation bar is the main tool that will help guide people on a website. Without one set in place, the user will have more difficulty navigating the website. If there is too much difficulty in navigating a website, the potential patient will search elsewhere. If a patient is searching for information on regular dental checkups at a specific practice and is interested in what the website states, then he or she may also search another page for more information on scheduling an appointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if the website is difficult to navigate, then the patient will be more likely to “bounce” to another website. Bounce is a term for when an individual leaves after only viewing a single page on a website and seeks to view other pages from a different website. The longer a potential patient spends on a website, the better chance that the patient will schedule an appointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Doctor Genius offers clients a mobile first website that renders the webpage to accurately display on any screen size. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Another reason that navigation bars are crucial for the success of a website is that they offer fast and efficient use of a website. In this day and age, people do not enjoy having to wait for anything. People want it fast and want it now. Thus, a navigation bar allows for people to immediately search for the specific service they need. Although, there is a new platform that has taken over many homes and the process for how people use the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile first technology</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"5120\" height=\"3837\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-989\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog.jpg 5120w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-1024x767.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-177x133.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5120px) 100vw, 5120px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>The Pew Research Center finds that as of 2016, at least 95 percent of Americans own a cellphone of some kind. PEW also finds that around 77 percent of adults in America use smartphones. With smartphones, people are now able to search the internet and complete a variety of other tasks with ease. Thus, having a mobile first website is crucial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile first means that the website renders the size to match the screen of the user’s device. A medical professional needs a mobile first website so that there are no issues finding a search bar on a phone or tablet. More and more people conduct searches on these devices while watching TV or relaxing at home, instead of using a computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we offer clients the option to customize the navigation bar to the top/scrolling, top/static, or left/static of the webpage. This menu option will change with any device to accurately match the screen size. By investing in Doctor Genius, we can build your website to not only be mobile first but also be easier to navigate. With the proper navigation, people are less likely to leave your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

People may<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/home-part-iv-effective-calls-action/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>An effective call-to-action can be the final push that a potential patient needs to seek a specific service. People may recall TV commercials from childhood ending with, “Buy now,” or “get one while supplies last.” While these examples can be effective for certain products, medical practices may need a slightly different approach. People will usually spend more time contemplating where to go for any form of medical care than buying a new movie or clothes at a store.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Up front and center</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For a medical practice, the call-to-action is a crucial step that needs to utilize both specific text and a button/window to capture the attention of a potential patient. For instance, if there is an option to “Schedule an appointment today,” then there needs to be a button or window that the individual can interact with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interaction is key since it promotes direct contact with the practice through the online portal or by calling the practice over the phone. The call-to-action can also help users navigate to other pages on the website from the home page. For instance, having the call-to-action button, “Click Here to Read More” can increase the chance of the individual navigating from the home page to that page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calls-to-action help create a home page that entices users to seek the practice’s professional service. It is important to have a clear call-to-action on the website home page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Be clear and concise</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Curatti.com states that 70 percent of small business websites do not have clear calls-to-action on their homepage.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The call-to-action on a home page needs to be clear in order to improve conversion rate. The conversion rate for a website is the rate of website users who become patients. In order to increase the conversion rate, it is important to have a clear call-to-action that highlights the specific type of care at the practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presenting the call-to-action in the first person to address the user will also help. Another step in creating an effective call-to-action is to include easy-to-access contact information. By structuring a home page to display the call-to-action in an easy-to-read place, the user will be more likely to interact with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we can customize the home page to not only highlight specific services but also present calls to action in such a way that the patient will be more likely to interact with the website. While it is not difficult to write out the phrase “Call Now” and place it on a button, we know the proper way to create and place the call-to-action.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

When a patient is searching for a new doctor, dentist or other medical practice, a strong website can provide an accurate depiction of the professional services available. Without a stable and effective website, potential patients will look elsewhere for the care they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fully-functional website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a survey on Mashable.com, they measure the general health care trends for patients online. One statistic displays that 69 percent of parents will seek medical answers on WebMD instead of contacting a real doctor, while 40 percent will search Wikipedia, 22 percent on Facebook and 20 percent on YouTube. With the internet being such a popular platform for people seeking medical advice, your website can be a source of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is great to have information on a website, it is important to have a website that actually works properly. At Doctor Genius, we will run continual maintenance on the website and post content on a regular basis to ensure that the website is actively reaching new patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Statistic Image 1\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-975\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile-first website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The technology in smartphones continues to evolve and allow people to accomplish more with such a small device. In fact, Demi &amp; Cooper Advertising and DC Interactive Group find that 19 percent of smartphone users have at least one health app on their phone. While an app may not be as useful for a medical practice, having a mobile-friendly website can. Since most people use their phone or tablet devices to use Facebook, Instagram, search the internet and send emails, there is a high chance that they will look up medical professionals on those devices as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mobile-first website will change the architecture of the web pages to match the screen of the device. This way, when people search for your website on their phone, it will adapt and display everything properly instead of cutting off pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Relevant content and background information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with the client to cover all of their relevant background information and content to advertise their services. By including this information, potential patients receive a trust signal in knowing that the medical professional has relevant information on a fully-functional website. This information also promotes starting a conversation about the patient’s health needs with the professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Links to reviews</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By including patient reviews on the website, people will not have to search elsewhere and can clearly see what people enjoyed about your medical services. We can also link to these websites for patients to see more reviews and vice versa. People will find the reviews online and visit the website. Thus, this system draws in more patients from across the web to your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
