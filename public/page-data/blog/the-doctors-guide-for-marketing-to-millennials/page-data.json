Even with a website and digital presence, medical professionals will experience difficulty in reaching clients of all ages. The fastest growing buying group in the market and the age group professionals seem to have difficulty marketing to more than others, is millennials. Fortunately, Doctor Genius is working with other companies to offer a CE event on the best methods for marketing to millennials.\r\n<h3>Event details</h3>\r\nThe event itself takes place at the Marriott Courtyard in Sherman Oaks, CA, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on February 16, 2016. The registration fee is $25, which includes dinner provided at the event. Others can attend this continuing education (CE) class to earn three credits as well. The focus of the event is to showcase proven marketing methods that attract and return millennial clients including:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Active websites packed with fresh, unique and tailored content for specific practices</li>\r\n \t<li>Effective branding strategies to give practices an edge in competitive markets</li>\r\n \t<li>The importance of active social media profiles</li>\r\n \t<li>The most effective retention methods to promote client loyalty</li>\r\n \t<li>The use of search marketing to find the keywords that clients select most</li>\r\n \t<li>Management of your practice reviews to follow what current clients are saying</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis event will cover many more topics and information on reaching millennial clients. For the event, Doctor Genius is collaborating with Patterson Dental, Bank of America, Nickerson Consulting, Revenue Well and CARR Healthcare Realty. Experienced speakers from these companies, operating in today’s competitive market, will present proven methods of reaching and retaining millennial clients.\r\n<h3>Easier said than done</h3>\r\nThe PEW Research Center finds that 81 percent of millennials are on Facebook and that only 19 percent of millennials “say that most people can be trusted.” This statistic makes it even more crucial for medical professionals to be able to build a strong bond to retain millennial clients. Millennials are a large group of possible clients who mainly connect with each other over social media platforms. A practice that has a successful online presence and active accounts in the digital market can effectively reach millennials.\r\n\r\nWhile most people can construct a website for any known service, keeping the website active, healthy, updated and on the first page of search results is difficult to do. Doctor Genius offers these services and more, using this CE event to go over the most effective methods for maintaining a strong presence among millennial clients. The event will have a plethora of advice from top industry speakers and marketing advice from companies of various backgrounds.
