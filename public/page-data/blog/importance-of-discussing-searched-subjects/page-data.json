Creating a shiny new website for your company is only half the battle — the rest involves filling in content that is engaging, useful, and informative to your customers. Keywords within that content are crucial for designing search engine optimization to bring to your site customers who might not know about your business and what you do. To take advantage of the latest search trends, you need to know why certain keywords and subjects are important for your business and how to use them effectively in content.</p>\r\n<h2>The importance of search trends</h2>\r\n<p>Search trends can be broken down into several categories. One involves seasonal change, e.g., consumers may be more interested in buying products during the summer than in the winter. Another is all about keywords, which are specific words or short phrases you use in the content of your website that a search engine matches to the search words someone has typed in. The more you incorporate those keywords, the higher your content will rank in engines like Google. Learning how to use these trends to guide your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\">latest article or blog topics</a> can keep your content relevant and appealing.</p>\r\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>To narrow down keywords that fit within the context of your work, you first have to figure out what consumers are searching for and what they are not. You can use the latest trends and analytics to narrow down keywords that match what your clients type into Google. Consider using a mix of short-tail and long-tail keywords to diversify your SEO and attract a wide variety of clients.</p>\r\n<h3>Short-tail keywords</h3>\r\n<p>As the name suggests, short-tail keywords are made up of three or fewer words. These are often incredibly broad and more frequently searched for. There are benefits and drawbacks to using shorter keywords. Your content is more likely to rank with a shorter keyword because so many articles can fit in the general topic. This allows for more people, particularly new customers, to find your page. However, your webpage will be competing with numerous other pages with the same keyword, sometimes in the thousands, making it less likely to rank higher in the results list.</p>\r\n<h3>Long-tail keywords</h3>\r\n<p>When you want to attract customers looking for something more specific, long-tail keywords are ideal. Longer keywords and phrases narrow down the search significantly, and while a keyword over three words long may not be searched for as frequently as shorter ones, someone who types it in is probably looking for exactly what you have to offer. It also makes your site <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274809\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274809\">more likely to rank higher</a> in the list of search engine results.</p>\r\n<h2>Tools to discover search trends</h2>\r\n<p>You can use any of these tools for search analytics to discover search trends and keywords:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Google Analytics</li>\r\n\t<li>Matomo</li>\r\n\t<li>Woopra</li>\r\n\t<li>GoSquared</li>\r\n\t<li>FoxMetrics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you have established a list of keywords and trends, you can confidently start using them in your content marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<h2>Find out more about searched subjects</h2>\r\n<p>Give your website the greatest chance to succeed by researching keywords and trends. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for help identifying the searched subjects for your business.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

When you consider that many people enter questions into the search box when researching a topic, it makes sense that researching and including a frequently asked questions in your content can help people land on your page.</p>\r\n<h3>Patient loyalty</h3>\r\n<p>If a patient has a question that your content successfully answers, this reflects positively on your practice and helps establish a positive relationship with the visitor. Potential patients want to know that your medical staff is qualified to provide the needed services, so displaying your expertise in your field builds trust. Even if visitors initially land on your page looking for specific information, there is a higher potential for them to become interested in your office and the services you offer.</p>\r\n<h3>User experience</h3>\r\n<p>An easy-to-use, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/websites\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/websites\">professional website</a> impresses visitors and guides them toward making a purchase or learning more about your service, while a nonresponsive site that is difficult to navigate can have the opposite effect, causing potential clients to look for a different practice. A frequently asked question section or page offers a user-friendly layout that allows patients to quickly scan the information and focus only on what is relevant to the search.</p>\r\n<h2>Tips for optimizing your commonly asked questions section</h2>\r\n<p>To get better results from a question and answer section, you must first develop a strategy and research what topics to cover.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most basic ways to find commonly asked questions is to do a Google search to find these. If you already have a list of keywords you want to include in your content, start by searching these terms.</p>\r\n<p>Many times, Google has a “<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/06/23/how-brands-can-optimize-googles-people-also-ask-feature/#31abdaeb1159\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/06/23/how-brands-can-optimize-googles-people-also-ask-feature/#31abdaeb1159\">People Also Ask</a>” section that includes questions people often search about the topic, along with an answer found on a specific webpage. For instance, if you search for “tooth decay” you may see questions like “How is tooth decay treated?” and “What are the stages of tooth decay?”</p>\r\n<p>To potentially be featured under this section and to rank higher on the Google results page when a patient searches these specific questions, include them in your FAQ section with keyword-rich answers.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you improve your content marketing strategy</h2>\r\n<p>Creating your content strategy, including adding questions and answer sections where relevant, can be difficult.

However, identifying which keywords or keyword phrases will deliver the desired results can be difficult without fundamental knowledge on the subject. No matter the current size or impact of your office’s website, it is essential you are ready with your toolbox of sources and methods for using the most effective keywords on every page.</p>\r\n<h2>Consider your specialty and customer base</h2>\r\n<p>Before you even jump on your computer to starting searching for keywords to include in your content, you need to first take time to brainstorm what your office has to offer and what your customers want and expect from your services.</p>\r\n<h3>Determine your niche</h3>\r\n<p>While you may assume that using broad keywords will help you draw in a larger group of people, focusing on certain specialties or your business&#8217;s niche has several benefits. For one, common, more general terms, such as “dentist” or “chiropractor,” are often more highly competed for, making it very difficult for smaller companies to rank well on search engines when up against well-established, national brands. In contrast, honing in on more specific services you offer or areas you specialize in, such as “GERD treatment” or “children dentistry” reduces the competition.</p>\r\n<p>Also, focusing your keyword research on your niche allows you to better target the exact type of customers who are likely to be interested in your services. For instance, if someone has a root canal that needs to be addressed, using the term “root canal treatment” can guide this individual to your page. This not only helps generates leads but is much more likely to result in a conversion</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on location</h3>\r\n<p>As a medical professional, you likely have an office that serves a specific area. Many customer searches including a local component, so centering your keywords on the city, state, or region in which you offer your services is an easy and effective way to better target your intended audience and to potentially rank on the first page of search engines. This includes taking both broad and specific terms and including a location in the keyword phrase, such as “TMJ doctor Spokane” or “orthodontist Sacramento area.”</p>\r\n<h2>Use tools to find effective keywords</h2>\r\n<p>The second part of results-producing keyword research is using the right tools to help you find keywords that fit your niche and target audience. Since many people use Google as their primary search engine, using Google-specific resources can be helpful:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Google Analytics</li>\r\n\t<li>Google Search Console</li>\r\n\t<li>Google Trends</li>\r\n\t<li>Google Keyword Planner</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are also third-party tools to explore, including SEM Rush, Keyword Tool, Moz Keyword Explorer, Ahrefs Keyword Explorer, and SpyFu.</p>\r\n<h2>Gain even more visibility on search engines</h2>\r\n<p>If you are ready to take your content marketing to the next level and want to see real results from your efforts, our team at Doctor Genius has the resources to get you there.
