This type of employee wants to be highly thought of and produce quality work. Intrinsic motivators can be some of the most compelling reasons why individuals choose to work in the medical field. Let&#8217;s examine ways to take advantage of intrinsic motivation in a medical office.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Get rid of preconceived ideas about motivation</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.tutor2u.net/business/reference/motivation-pink-three-elements-of-intrinsic-motivation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Daniel Pink</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, a well-known author and speaker about motivation, the common tendency is to think of motivation as either based on fear or excitement. Many people are motivated by the fear of failure, disappointing others, or punishment. As well, just about everyone appears to work harder when excited by the promise of a reward, either in the form of a compliment or a bonus. While these things may be true, though, they are not necessarily the primary reasons for people&#8217;s actions. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Discover what truly motivates your staff members</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When office management is aware of the primary reasons employees are motivated, managers can both help staff members to thrive and encourage them to be more productive. This in turn can enhance the patient experience. Here are three main intrinsic motivators to consider.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The ability to self-manage</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This can be a struggle for many management teams, because the traditional office system requires employees to comply with orders and dutifully complete tasks without question. However, allowing staff members to self-direct can be an excellent way to get them more engaged in their work. It can also open the door for them to present thoughts or ideas related to the job and the improvement of related processes or programs. It is critical to find a balance between assigning tasks and allowing employees to suggest them. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The desire for self-improvement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Progress and personal achievement can be incredible motivators. When people improve because they want to rather than because they are told to, the results come much faster and last much longer. The trick with implementing this type of motivator is to assign tasks that are not too difficult but go beyond the basics of what is commonly performed by the employee. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The desire to connect with a bigger cause</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most people want to do things that make a difference or leave a lasting impression. Menial tasks tend to be a disincentive or deterrence to job satisfaction. Because the bulk of an employee&#8217;s daytime hours are typically spent at work, it can be much more motivating when that work matters in a meaningful way. A key way to introduce this in a medical office is to </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/communicate-new-mission-vision-30929.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">clearly communicate</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> the goals, values, and mission of the company. Understanding how their role within the office matters can allow employees to feel they are contributing to the greater good. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Motivate your office</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tapping into the intrinsic motivators of your medical office staff can help employees get more enjoyment out of their jobs, increase productivity, and even improve the patient experience. At Doctor Genius, we understand how critical it is to care for both patients and staff members.

Because the<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/5-cost-accounting-tips-for-a-medical-practice/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Although it is a newer concept, cost accounting can be very beneficial for medical practices of all sizes. Because the demand to lower the cost of health care is becoming more urgent, it can be helpful to streamline the process of eliminating unnecessary expenses by understanding and implementing this type of accounting system. </p>\r\n<h2>What is cost accounting?</h2>\r\n<p>A cost accounting system focuses on recording, classifying, and allocating the expenses of a company to help determine the actual cost of services and products. The idea is when the exact uses of funds are known, costs of services and products can not only be clearly defined but also reduced. This accounting method can also help pinpoint the profitability of specific ventures or expenditures so more well-informed decisions can be made about future purchases or endeavors.</p>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/healthcare-cost-accounting-8-strategies-to-streamline-implementation-and-quickly-achieve-measurable-results.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/healthcare-cost-accounting-8-strategies-to-streamline-implementation-and-quickly-achieve-measurable-results.html\">Becker&#8217;s Hospital CFO Report</a>, the main obstacle to overcome when trying to implement a cost accounting system is creating an accurate Relative Value Unit without being overwhelmed or confused by the math. Because the RVU ultimately helps to determine the costs associated with the charge description master, which can be extensive and complex, it is important to establish clear, correct RVUs before proceeding further. It is also crucial to have the cooperation of everyone involved with the practice since efficient communication of data can be a large part of the process. </p>\r\n<h2>5 ways to make cost accounting work for a medical practice</h2>\r\n<p>There are differences between how a traditional company and a medical practice operate, but an accounting method like this can work particularly well in a service industry where costs are tied more to time and expertise than products. Here are some tips to help your medical practice implement an effective cost accounting system. </p>\r\n<h3>1. Delegate to responsible team members</h3>\r\n<p>Rather than having one person attempt to figure out all the RVUs alone, it can be helpful to get other staff members involved. Especially for larger practices with multiple departments, tasking a tenured, capable staff member from each department with compiling specific RVUs can speed the process up quite a bit. Even for smaller practices, enlisting the assistance of staff members who are familiar with the services and products can help establish these amounts more accurately. When deciding who to select for the assignment, take into consideration factors such as how well the employee knows the CDM codes, resource consumption, and operating procedures. </p>\r\n<h3>2. Ensure the correct CDM codes are being used</h3>\r\n<p>Aside from their importance for cost accounting, correct CDM usage is beneficial for patients and medical practices alike to ensure proper billing and insurance charges. Because CDM codes play a significant role in defining the RVUs, CDMs used incorrectly can result in inaccurate numbers. Charges are also becoming increasingly automated, and some software does not require individual service codes to be entered manually. Before relying on CDM codes to help generate RVUs, it can be important to revisit how the codes are being applied to get the most accurate RVUs possible. According to the <a href=\"https://www.hfma.org/topics/article/57212.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hfma.org/topics/article/57212.html\">Healthcare Financial Management Association</a>, respondents to a survey reported the area that most needed improvement was statistics and RVUs. This shows team members are aware of a deficiency and may welcome additional training in this area. </p>\r\n<h3>3. Utilize all available techniques and data</h3>\r\n<p>It is not necessary to develop all the RVUs from scratch. For some services and products, there will be information such as actual cost, industry-standard RVUs, and staffing ratios that allow the RVU to be determined quickly. In many cases, the actual cost of products is known or can be determined easily by contacting the vendor rep. Some factors, such as time spent on a service or clinical skill level required, are also fairly objective and can be used to develop a standardized RVU. In many cases, a minimum cost for these factors already exists, and all that is left to do is determining how much the margin needs to increase to meet the fiscal needs of the practice. </p>\r\n<h3>4. Prioritize</h3>\r\n<p>There should naturally be a large difference in dollar amount between your most costly and least costly RVUs. Instead of determining them by department, alphabetically, or using some other method, it can be a good idea to start with the RVUs that cost the most. Whether they cost more because of the time or resources involved, or because they are used the most frequently, these are often the RVUs that determine the profitability of the practice. For example, if your RVUs are below the national benchmark average, but you have a high patient volume, you may need to take a look at the efficiency of your practice in order to grow. </p>\r\n<h3>5. Get the math right</h3>\r\n<p>Arriving at an accurate RVU is more complicated than simply taking the purchase costs and adding subjective charges to get a number. The base price of a product or service is not merely the cost associated with acquiring the item or performing the service. Other factors that add to the initial cost must be added to determine the true value. The following variables must be taken into account:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Labor costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Building lease costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Equipment costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Office supply costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Malpractice and insurance premium costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Time</li>\r\n\t<li>Necessary clinical skill</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are costs that need to be incorporated into the RVUs to keep a practice profitable. It is also important to adjust for a geographic variance. It is absolutely possible to calculate RVUs manually, and for smaller practices, this can be the least expensive choice. Especially for practices with tenured, experienced team members able to help with determining RVUs, it can be a way to encourage staff involvement and elevate thinking. Larger practices may want to consider investing in software or calculation programs and automating the process as much as possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more practice management best practices</h2>\r\n<p>Cost accounting is just one of many ways to improve the health of your medical practice.

For people who do not connect with your practice or are not in need of the services you offer, the interaction may end here. For those who are part of your target audience or within your scope of influence, this step is critical for securing a conversion.</p>\r\n<p>The patient wants to know that you offer the needed services, have a good reputation, and are qualified to do the job at hand. While some patients may be ready to employ your services quickly, others may need more time in the consideration stage.

Even after deciding to get your services, however, patients may hesitate or forget to follow through. Automated email reminders, calls from a staff member, free consultation offers, or invitations to a special webinar can all help guide them to finalizing the appointment.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you master the marketing funnel</h2>\r\n<p>Knowing how to effectively guide potential patients through the marketing funnel takes significant expertise and practice.

Establishing a balance of common industry standards, the DSO of your practice and the needs of the patients can help pinpoint the necessary terms to offer. </p>\r\n<h3>Switch to automated billing</h3>\r\n<p>Particularly for practices with a high ratio of patients to staff members, it can be a good idea to have an automated billing process. This helps ensure bills are sent out on time and do not get lost in the shuffle. Simply put, the faster patients receive a bill, the faster they can pay it. If your practice still sends out paper statements and bills, you may want to consider electronic billing. Online invoicing and billing make it possible for a patient to receive and pay a bill the same day it is sent out instead of days or weeks later. This method also allows payments to be easily tracked as opposed to checks and payment stubs that can be more labor-intensive to monitor. </p>\r\n<h3>Pay attention to invoicing</h3>\r\n<p>Even if your billing is already automated, it is important to be detailed when inputting patient and invoicing information. A bill sent to the wrong patient or address will not get paid. Are the invoices accurate and being sent out on time? Even small errors in amounts due or account numbers can end up costing the practice significant amounts of money. Spot-checking invoices is a good way to find and fix common errors that can delay payments and increase the DSO. </p>\r\n<h3>Offer multiple methods of payment</h3>\r\n<p>The fastest way to get paid is obviously to ask the patients for payments upfront. However, there are cases where patients may not be able to pay the full amount at once and need to spread out payments. Rather than sending out monthly statements and bills and relying on the patient to mail a check or call and make a payment over the phone, consider having an online payment portal. A well-planned internet payment system can allow patients to view statements and make payments quickly and easily. The less work involved with paying a bill, the more likely and faster a patient is to pay it. </p>\r\n<h3>Consistently follow up with patients</h3>\r\n<p>Following up can be one of the most effective ways to make sure patients do not ignore invoices. Email reminders and text message reminders typically work well, and phone call reminders can be even better because of the personal touch of talking directly to another human being. This can be particularly helpful with bills that are past due. To keep your practice&#8217;s DSO where it should be, which is ideally 10-15 days beyond the terms of sale, staff members need to be proactive about sending reminders or making phone calls. </p>\r\n<h3>Offer incentives</h3>\r\n<p>Far from costing the practice money, offering early payment discounts can be a smart way to keep cash flow in the practice instead of tied up in accounts receivable. It can be a win for both the practice and the patientd, because the patients pay less and the practice gets the capital sooner. Having a faster cash flow, getting better rates from creditors, and saving interest on loan fees are just a few ways receiving faster patient payments can improve the balance sheet of a practice. Charging a late payment penalty is another option to help offset some of the costs the practice incurs when the billing moves to a collections department. </p>\r\n<h3>Stay committed</h3>\r\n<p>Lowering your DSO does not happen overnight. If your goal is to reduce it by 20 days, it can take several months to see significant progress. While it can be motivating to see that number drop, the initial excitement of making a difference can wear off quickly. Effecting significant improvements and sustaining them long-term requires a change of habits in everyone from the executives to the billing department. Setting expectations for the staff regarding accounts receivable and regularly discussing DSO metrics can help maintain focus and ensure all the effort put into lowering the DSO is not wasted. </p>\r\n<h2>We can help you improve practice management</h2>\r\n<p>There are many ways to take your practice management skills to the next level.

According to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301787889_Burnout_in_DentistryAn_overview\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301787889_Burnout_in_DentistryAn_overview\">study done at ResearchGate</a>, dental employees are getting burned out due to a disconnect between the demands and resources of the job and personal goals, skills, and abilities. Employers can turn this work exhaustion around through practice management that is fun, exciting, and different. Make your employees want to come to work with these methods.</p>\r\n<h2>The importance of making work fun</h2>\r\n<p>Employees who dread coming to work are far less likely to put full effort into the job. This not only affects everyone’s <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/\">mental and physical health</a>, but it can also negatively impact your business. Patients may notice when an employee seems lethargic or disinterested, and in an industry that is based heavily on in-person communication and personal connections, this can prevent patients from returning to your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to improve staff satisfaction</h2>\r\n<p>There are endless ways you can make work more enjoyable for employees and yourself. To get an idea of what will truly benefit your employees, ask around for ideas or run through suggestions. See what seems to click with them and what should be avoided. To get started, here are four methods that can improve work attitudes and rejuvenate the office atmosphere.  </p>\r\n<h3>1. Focus on communication</h3>\r\n<p>Communication is key regardless of what industry you work in, and there are specific aspects that you can focus on to positively impact your employees. For example, simply showing appreciation now and then for work efforts can boost your team’s confidence. Prioritizing organization can make sure that everyone understands what is going on in the office and prevents frustration over miscommunications. Listening is a key part of communication, so when you ask your employees what can be fixed, show that you listened by actually addressing the problems.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Try flexible hours</h3>\r\n<p>Providing flexible work hours can demonstrate that you care about employees’ personal lives. If an important event or emergency arises, an employee with flexible hours can feel confident in changing the work schedule without the fear of being ostracized. This helps reduce the stresses of the work-life balance without shorting either.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Organize office-wide activities</h3>\r\n<p>Fun games, happy hour get-togethers after work, and charitable activities, such as volunteering for community service, can help everyone bond and learn to work effectively together. Team-building in other areas can help employees appreciate each other more back in the office. Social gatherings, such as throwing everyone a party at the end of the year to celebrate successes, allows people to connect on a personal level that does not involve work.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Improve the office space</h3>\r\n<p>Sometimes little changes are what people notice the most. Decorating the office for seasons or holidays can liven everyone’s day and break up the regular pace. Putting in plants, adding new furniture that optimizes the office’s workspace, and even <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240985\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240985\">providing food</a> can energize everyone and increase office production.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more great changes</h2>\r\n<p>Elevating employees e can benefit everyone who enters your medical practice, including both employees and patients.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
