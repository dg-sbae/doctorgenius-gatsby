While<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/qualifying-events-for-patients-marriage/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>People typically only have one opportunity to enroll in an employee benefit program, unless there are other qualifying events. While certain events might not be on people&#8217;s radar, most know that marriage constitutes a life event. A patient getting married who is satisfied with the current benefits program can be more likely to remain enrolled. Conversely, those who are dissatisfied may see an opportunity to drop their coverage.</p>\r\n<h2>Increasing employee satisfaction with benefits</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ways to create a positive patient experience for clients so a life event like marriage is a reason for them to increase current coverage rather than leave.</p>\r\n<h3>Provide multiple channels for connection</h3>\r\n<p>Traditionally, patients are reminded about yearly examinations or upcoming appointments with a flyer in their mailbox or a phone call. A reminder about an open enrollment period or life event from a benefits provider can also jog their memory. In addition to these methods, it can be helpful to send out notifications through text messages or emails. While this usually requires client consent, it can be more effective not only in getting patients to keep their appointments but also in helping them have a positive experience.</p>\r\n<p>You may also want to consider allowing patients to make or change appointments through a portal available on the company website. This can encourage clients to take control of their health care and make scheduling their responsibility. </p>\r\n<h3>Encourage staff interaction </h3>\r\n<p>Patients who feel supported by every staff member they come into contact with can be more likely to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207234/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207234/\">feel valued as a client</a>. Each time an employee walks by patients without smiling or acknowledging them in some way, patients may feel less like a person and more like a case number. When all staff members make patient care a top priority, it can encourage not only patient loyalty but also an increased sense of urgency regarding personal health care. Clients who feel valued by health care providers can be more likely to not only be pleased with their benefits package but also to recommend remaining with their current providers to a new spouse.   </p>\r\n<h3>Offer affordable payment plans</h3>\r\n<p>It is unrealistic to think all treatments can be offered at affordable rates. However, expecting clients to pay a premium out of pocket for treatment can result in fewer patients agreeing to certain procedures. The following are options for payment that patients often prefer:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Financing</li>\r\n\t<li>Monthly installment payments made directly to the medical practice</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduced cost for paying the total upfront with <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/paying-medical-bills-with-no-health-insurance-2385907\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/paying-medical-bills-with-no-health-insurance-2385907\">cash</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Making both elective and necessary treatments more affordable can encourage patients to see health care as a more affordable option. </p>\r\n<h2>Discover more ways to keep clients during qualifying events</h2>\r\n<p>Sometimes, increasing client retention can be accomplished by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/plans\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/plans\">restructuring your website</a> to make it more attractive and user-friendly.

The thrill that comes with the prospect<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-have-a-live-site/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>For many business owners, building a website is an exciting yet stressful endeavor. The thrill that comes with the prospect of expanding one’s reach and attracting new patients or clients is shadowed by the pressure to get everything, from the design to the navigation to the content, just right. If you can relate to this, you may be tempted to sit back, relax, and watch your site do its work once you hit “Publish.” We recommend against doing this, as your website will not work for you — at least not very well — without some tender loving care.</p>\r\n<h2>How to increase the effectiveness of your website</h2>\r\n<p>To maximize the effectiveness of your website, you need to keep it active. A live site is one that is continually updated, maintained, and refined. To keep your website from decaying, create a live site checklist. Below are four items to add to it.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Refresh your content</h3>\r\n<p>Content drives traffic to your website and engages visitors. However, if it is not written for your audience, contains errors, or lacks the appropriate keywords, you risk driving visitors away: if you attract them at all.</p>\r\n<p>After you launch your site, wait a couple of days and then go back to review your content with a fresh eye. Overtime, tweak it so that it is in line with your brand’s voice and speaks directly to your target market. Optimize it for search, correct any errors, and take out or edit any information that is inaccurate or no longer relevant. Go through <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\">old blogs</a> that were successful, looking for what worked and what didn&#8217;t work on ranking reports. At this point, you can decide if your keywords need to be refreshed, so that future blogs are relevant or if you should elaborate on what worked well. For webpages, after enough time has elapsed, you may need to redo the page altogether. By auditing your content regularly, you can ensure it stays fresh and effective.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Add new content</h3>\r\n<p>Google prioritizes new, pertinent content over the stale, out-of-date subject matter. This is evident by its <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/freshness-update/#close\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/freshness-update/#close\">2016 “Freshness” algorithm</a>, which places a greater emphasis on the recentness of content than it ever has before. Not only does Google appreciate new content, but so, too, does your audience.</p>\r\n<p>New content in the form of blogs, landing pages, videos, infographics, white papers, and the like helps you to increase audience retention, establish trust, build authority, and, ultimately, encourage conversions. For these reasons, and for ranking purposes, one of the first things you should do after launching your website is to build a content marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Update your imagery</h3>\r\n<p>When people return to your site, it is because they like what they saw before and want to see what new and exciting things you have to offer. Changes, no matter how slight (such as a new banner or an updated team picture), can appease return visitors and entice them to visit again soon.</p>\r\n<p>New imagery can also give your rankings a boost. By using alt text, captions, image sitemaps, and image structured data, you can make your imagery searchable, ensuring that each page of content pulls double duty.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Check usability</h3>\r\n<p>Several factors affect usability, including site speed, navigation, security and mobility. Perform a complete audit of your site across multiple different devices and platforms to ensure it performs optimally on each. If you discover any shortcomings or errors, such as 404s or slow load time, fix them to ensure a smooth user experience.   </p>\r\n<h2>See how our marketing solutions can keep your site live</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we have the tools, talent, and resources to help your business thrive online.

Some states offer<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/keeping-patients-when-children-move-off-of-family-plans/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Per the Affordable Care Act, insurers phase young adults off their parents’ insurance plans by their mid-20s. Some states offer more flexibility and allow adult children to remain health care dependents until they are 30. As a provider, it is important that you understand your state’s particular rules and have a backup plan in place for when a young patient, inevitably, finds him or herself without coverage.</p>\r\n<h2>Age requirements for extended health care coverage</h2>\r\n<p>Prior to the passage of the ACA, 37 states had already adopted a policy that granted young adults the option to remain on their parents’ health plans beyond the age of 18. However, to protect those adults living in the 13 other states that have a hard cut-off age of 19, the Obama Administration included a provision within the Affordable Care Act that states a young adult can remain on a parent’s insurance plan until the age of 26. While states can continue with their existing state law requirements for extended coverage, they may not interfere with the application of the ACA.</p>\r\n<p>Per most states’ laws, the cut-off age was 25. Several state laws mandated that individuals be full-time students, unmarried, without dependents of their own, and residents of the state to qualify for benefits. Some went so far as to say that a dependent must reside in the same home as the policyholder. The ACA merely gave young adults in these states a year-longer grace period without severely disrupting insurers’ policies.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the extra year grace period, the ACA made it easier for young adults to <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/children-under-26/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/children-under-26/\">qualify for dependent coverage</a>. Per the law, any person younger than the age of 26 may remain on a parent’s health insurance plan even if the following apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The dependent starts or leaves school</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent gets married</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent is no longer considered a dependent for tax purposes</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent lives in or out of the family home</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent has or adopts a child</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent was offered, but turned down, employer-based coverage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When coverage stops after a person turns 26 depends on the type of plan a parent has. If a parent has a marketplace plan, the dependent may remain on the policy until the end of the year he or she turns 26. The child must use the open enrollment or special enrollment period (whichever comes first) to apply for individual coverage. If a parent has a job-based plan, the dependent’s coverage ends at the end of his or her birthday month.</p>\r\n<h2>States with extended coverage</h2>\r\n<p>Several states grant young adults even more leeway by allowing <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/dependent-health-coverage-state-implementation.aspx\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/dependent-health-coverage-state-implementation.aspx\">extended dependent coverage up until the age of 30</a>. For instance, Florida allows young, unmarried individuals who do not have dependents of their own to remain on their parents’ plans until the age of 30. In Illinois, parents of dependents who are also veterans may do the same. Other states that extend dependent coverage beyond age 26 include Wisconsin (27), South Dakota (29), New York (30), Pennsylvania (30) and New Jersey (31). These states generally require an adult child to remain unmarried and dependent-free to qualify for extended coverage.</p>\r\n<h2>Special enrollment periods</h2>\r\n<p>As a health care provider, you have a responsibility to your patients to advise them on what they can do to improve their health and quality of life. Part of doing both involves ensuring patients have adequate coverage. If you learn that a patient is about to be phased off a parent’s insurance plan, encourage them to conduct research early on, as they have limited time to enroll in a new plan.</p>\r\n<p>Patients whose parents have marketplace coverage have a 120-day window to apply for coverage. This special enrollment window begins 60 days before one’s 26th birthday and ends 60 days afterward.</p>\r\n<p>The special enrollment period for individuals whose parents have employer-based coverage is slightly shorter. It begins 60 days before a person’s 26th birthday but ends only 30 days after the big day. Individuals who miss the special enrollment period must wait for <a href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/individual-and-family/2020-obamacare-open-enrollment-dates-by-state/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/individual-and-family/2020-obamacare-open-enrollment-dates-by-state/\">open enrollment</a>, which begins November 1st and ends December 15th. (California’s open enrollment period is slightly longer, beginning on October 15th and ending January 31st.)</p>\r\n<h2>Coverage options beyond 26</h2>\r\n<p>Most people are partial to their doctors or dentists and will do what is necessary to remain a patient. However, because cost is almost always a factor, you may lose a young patient who cannot afford your services to a cheaper competitor or clinic. You can take steps to prevent this from happening by informing patients of affordable coverage alternatives. Some options to discuss with young adults are as follows.</p>\r\n<h3>Shop through the exchange</h3>\r\n<p>The health care exchange is a young person’s best bet for finding affordable coverage. Advise patients that if their income is between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line, they may qualify for tax credits to help subsidize the cost of health care coverage.</p>\r\n<h3>Find coverage through school or an employer</h3>\r\n<p>Many universities offer affordable coverage to students. If a patient is not a student, encourage him or her to ask about job-based coverage.</p>\r\n<h3>Apply for Medicaid or CHIP</h3>\r\n<p>Medicaid is low- to no-cost health insurance available to individuals whose incomes fall below 138% of the federal poverty line. CHIP is a low-cost option for pregnant women.</p>\r\n<h3>Look into COBRA</h3>\r\n<p>COBRA allows a young adult to stay on their parent&#8217;s plan for up to 18 months after their 26<sup>th</sup> birthday. However, the policyholders must assume the cost of coverage, which can get expensive.</p>\r\n<h3>Check out catastrophic plans</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/catastrophic-insurance\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/catastrophic-insurance\">Catastrophic plans</a> are only available to people under 30. These plans come with high deductibles and assume the holder will not be using the benefits much, if at all. However, premiums are low, averaging about $173 per month.</p>\r\n<h2>We can help you retain patients</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is #1 in new patient acquisition, and we are not too bad at patient retention, either.
