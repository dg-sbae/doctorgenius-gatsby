Part of that is building a web presence that returns high results when new clients are on the hunt for your type of care. Structured data is one tool that can be used to push your site to the top of search results. When working toward broadening your client base, utilizing diverse strategies like this can get your practice increased visibility.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover structured data basics</h2>\r\n<p>Much like a shape sorter in preschool, structured data&#8217;s purpose is to categorize and organize similar information. Like SEO, where keywords can generate a higher ranking in search results, structured data can promote a website by offering searchers a snapshot of information about your page. Structured data is similar to a meta description in that it gives a small amount of insight that is then filtered through search engines and displayed according to the terms set out in the markup language. The <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-is-structured-data/\">most common type of information filtered into structured data</a> is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Photographs or graphics</li>\r\n\t<li>Practice name and type</li>\r\n\t<li>Ratings</li>\r\n\t<li>Comments or reviews</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Using data organized in this fashion cuts down the dependence on algorithms to fish for the search results. The structured data puts itself in the position for ranking more readily.</p>\r\n<h2>Boost your webpage ranking</h2>\r\n<p>Sorting information requires rules. Schema.org is the webpage that is responsible for coming up with the categories, structure, and, ultimately, the rules for how data is sorted. It sifts through published webpages and returns them according to these structured data rules. If you fashion your practice&#8217;s website to maximize the established <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/sd-policies\">structured data rules</a>, Google and other search engines are more likely to highlight your page at the top, in the rich results. The more prominent your webpage appears, the more visits you get, and the higher the conversion rate. Using the right data points may land your page in the rich results more often than not.</p>\r\n<h3>Images</h3>\r\n<p>Graphics perform well with potential clients. Why? A webpage that is easy to read through and visually attractive tends to get a higher return rate than those that are devoid of color and images. Plus, when it comes to appealing to structured data, tagging a picture will help push it into the rich results faster. The <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\">photos you choose</a> for your practice&#8217;s page should be relevant and not too overwhelming to sensitive people. Shy away from graphic illustrations or depictions of conditions, viruses, or injuries.</p>\r\n<h3>Ratings</h3>\r\n<p>Your website&#8217;s comment section is one place that may generate a lot of interest in your practice. Prospective clients like to review feedback to get a feel for the type of service you provide. Having your star rating or examples of client comments show up in rich results gives those people searching the chance to quickly see what public opinion has to say about your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Get assistance now</h2>\r\n<p>Getting new clients into your practice requires a reboot of traditional marketing thinking.

Too<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-build-out-site-architecture/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Building a successful and beneficial website, both for your business and clients, requires more than an appealing visual layout. Too often, businesses focus on how a site looks when they should construct it with search engine optimization and information flow in mind. By building your website with clientele needs and <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\">SEO keywords</a> as the driving point, you are more likely to attract a larger target audience.</p>\r\n<h2>Steps to successfully build site architecture</h2>\r\n<p>Site architecture refers to every aspect of your website, including the smallest details that most visitors will not even see: design, layout, easy-to-read content, social media links, contact information, email list sign-ups, etc. Before jumping into design, start by identifying your goals and your customers. What do you want people to discover when landing on your homepage? What kind of visitors do you want your site to attract? Once you have defined these measures, you are ready to work on the following steps for building out your site architecture.</p>\r\n<h3>Find your keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Keywords are the essential tool customers use to find websites that are relevant to an online search. By incorporating the most commonly used keywords into your site, it is more likely to rank higher on the list of results. Consider using tools like Keyword Discovery or Wordtracker to explore keywords that fit your business and audience. Research the competitiveness of each keyword (how often it is used by others in your business), the frequency that each word or phrase is typed into search engines, and the specificity of them (if they are broad terms for customers beginning a search or specific terms for those who are looking for an exact product).</p>\r\n<h3>Create a site map</h3>\r\n<p>A site map is made up of the layers within your website that generate a natural flow of information and link one page to the next. The map is usually designed based on a hierarchical structure, with categories, tags, and backlinks that separate out information in a logical order. The map should be easy to navigate so that a visitor can quickly find the information they are looking for.</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on aesthetics</h3>\r\n<p>Now it is time to focus on your <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#395646be7645\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#395646be7645\">website’s appearance</a> and how well it functions for your audience. This is just as important as establishing keywords and a site map since this is the part the customer actually pays attention to. A website that is confusing to navigate or lacks a clear, concise message on the landing page is more likely to lose viewers quickly. Use headlines and a short blurb at the top of your homepage to inform people about your business and guide visitors toward relevant information. Pictures can help break up text and make a page easier to read.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more ways to improve site architecture</h2>\r\n<p>Building a website right the first time is essential to establish a loyal customer base and grow your business.

Clients rely heavily on reviews and site content when choosing a new provider. Separating your practice from similar ones may come down to content design and website readability. Keeping things such as language and sentence structure simple may not only boost your SEO ranking, but it can also capture more business. Find out how keeping things simple can make all the difference when trying to attract more clients.</p>\r\n<h2>Readers have a short attention span</h2>\r\n<p>The world runs at a quick pace, and building a practice page that caters to this is imperative. With the demands of work and family obligations, readers do not want to spend time conducting extensive research to find a provider. Websites that present information in a concise and precise manner tend to top the list in search results, in part due to the ease with which readers can get the information they want. The quicker visitors find what is needed from your site, the more likely they are to return or, better yet, make an appointment. Simplifying website content to make it user-friendly may result in more conversions than you might think.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing tools that simplify content</h2>\r\n<p>A website has only a few seconds to grab a potential client&#8217;s attention and keep them on the page. One way to do this is by creating content that is user friendly, eye-catching, and relevant. Using a more simplistic writing style is beneficial as it tends to reach a wider audience and keep them engaged longer.</p>\r\n<h3>Short sentences</h3>\r\n<p>For a medical practice, you may believe that using an elevated vocabulary and complex sentence structure makes you sound like more of an expert. However, these things lead to fewer conversions because visitors cannot get the message fast enough. Long sentences can prove hard to follow and process. When readers need to read something more than once to understand it, they will likely move on to another site.</p>\r\n<h3>Headings</h3>\r\n<p>With the barrage of information available on the internet, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">readers tend to skim articles</a> to find what they want. Making content easy to scan is crucial for keeping readers engaged with your practice&#8217;s website. Shorter sentences are faster to read. Paragraph headers make finding information at a glance easier by breaking up content in a concise and organized fashion. Headings, along with short sentences, make navigating a webpage for relevant insight quicker.</p>\r\n<h3>Graphics</h3>\r\n<p>People like visually appealing web pages. Using graphics on your practice&#8217;s page allows potential clients a peek inside your office. Pictures can also draw the eye to other areas you wish to highlight. According to <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm\">washington.edu</a>, website graphics should:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Guide readers to focus on essential portions of the text</li>\r\n\t<li>Conform to the design of the site</li>\r\n\t<li>Not bog the site down with longer loading times</li>\r\n\t<li>Not take away from the content of the page</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Help is at the ready</h2>\r\n<p>The task of creating relevant and easily digestible content for your practice&#8217;s website may feel overwhelming, but we can help.
