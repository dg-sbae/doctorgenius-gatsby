Furthermore, a practice that invests in marketing spending has a much higher chance of surpassing their competitors. Here are some important ways it can help your practice thrive.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a brand</h2>\r\n<p>Brand differentiation, or distinguishing yourself from the rest, may seem more the purview of high-end fashion companies. Still, it is one of the most essential goals marketing spending can achieve. Which dentist is a consumer going to choose, the one who has a stellar reputation or the one who is just a “normal dentist”? Of course, there is no substitute for quality work, but marketing spending can amplify the service you provide and help your practice grow.</p>\r\n<p>Brand building in a consumer-savvy market may be difficult, but consider that one of your greatest assets are your people. In a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx\">Gallup survey</a> of more than 1,600 customers in three different service categories, researchers found that one of the biggest determining factors that affected a consumer’s decision to stay loyal to a brand was their interactions with customer-facing employees.</p>\r\n<p>In your practice, you and your employees are the ones who are fulfilling the promise that your brand makes. If consumers have a positive experience with you that reinforces that branding in your advertising, they will be more likely to come back and recommend the practice to others.</p>\r\n<p>Another creative way to build a brand is through <a title=\"Backlink\" href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\">content marketing</a>. Many consumers are tired of being bombarded by ads trying to sell them something, but content marketing allows your practice to present helpful information to a potential customer through a blog or video. This way the customer connects the helpful content to you and your practice and will be more likely to think of you when they need services. It also provides the opportunity for you to build an original brand through your content.</p>\r\n<h2>Effective advertising</h2>\r\n<p>In the digital age, there are myriad avenues of advertisement. No longer can practices only advertise on television or radio; they must also consider the various advertising opportunities on the internet. Whether social media, search engine, or pay-per-click advertising, the right choice is determined by your practice and your competition. Either way, it is strongly recommended that part of your marketing budget be dedicated to digital advertising even when marketing during recessions. More specific examples of digital advertising are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Facebook ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Google search ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Search engine optimization </li>\r\n\t<li>Geo-targeted ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Social media posts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Which type of ad is most effective depends on the practice, but it is a good idea to consider using a mix of ads rather than spending all your resources on one platform.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you organize your marketing spending</h2>\r\n<p>Each practice has different marketing needs.

For many patients,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/posting-blogs-on-open-enrollment/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that insurance plays a vital role in patients getting needed healthcare services. For many patients, financial difficulties limit what care is available, and having a reliable insurance policy can help overcome this barrier. As a physician or other healthcare provider it is necessary that you inform patients about open enrollment periods and help them find policies that work well for each unique situation. This medical marketing strategy ensures that your patients are able to continue using your practice for essential health needs.</p>\r\n<h2>FAQs about open enrollment</h2>\r\n<p>Many doctors tend to stay away from any discussion about insurance with patients. However, it is important that you inform patients when open enrollment is available so that you can be an advocate for your patients getting the care they deserve. When patients are not concerned about financial barriers to care, your practice will see more appointments made and procedures accepted. </p>\r\n<h3>What is open enrollment?</h3>\r\n<p>There is a narrow window of time that insurance companies allow patients to sign up for policies. It often only happens once a year, so it is important that patients do not miss the opportunity. Sometimes insurance companies host an enrollment day at the patient&#8217;s job if the company has a group health plan. Other times, though, the patient may be required to contact the insurance company individually. For patients turning 65, assistance with signing up for a Medicare policy can be beneficial.</p>\r\n<h3>Why is it an important marketing strategy? </h3>\r\n<p>To establish a credible, trusting relationship with your patients, you must be able to guide them through every part of receiving healthcare. Insurance coverage is one thing that many patients struggle with. By informing your patients of available insurance options and making sure that they sign up on time, you are securing that patient in your practice for the coming year. You do not want to lose an established patient simply because they forgot to sign back up on an insurance plan and can no longer afford your services. </p>\r\n<h3>How can a practice get the word out to patients?</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to reminding patients at every appointment when insurance enrollment will begin, having a practice blog can greatly benefit you. According to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY\">NBC News</a>, approximately 80% of internet users have looked up some type of health information online. We are living in a connected society, and it is important that you have a place for your patients to read credible health information. <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">Your blog</a> can also be a great outlet for reminding patients of things like open enrollment, and updating it often helps your patients feel more connected to your practice at all times.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about our services</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is committed to providing effective SEO marketing strategies for your practice.

When someone browses the web for a relevant practitioner, you not only want your company&#8217;s webpage to rank high on search results, but you also want that click to convert into an appointment. How do you build trust using your website? Discover a few ways regular blog posts may accomplish this, and more, for your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Blog posts build a connection</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb\">Forbes.com</a>, blog posts help establish a connection between readers and your practice. When your content is well written and provides accurate information in a relatable way, readers will respond. Creating informative posts bridges the gap between potential customers and your practice. Adding posts regularly builds your presence in the Google metrics and boosts your live site.</p>\r\n<h2>Successful blogs contain these elements</h2>\r\n<p>At DG, we know what it takes to boost your blog. By utilizing SEO-friendly techniques, our content develops an authoritative voice to elevate your practice in search results. Google uses the E-A-T system (Expertise, Authority, and Trust) to rank the trustworthiness of a brand or website. The more blogs that utilize certain measures, the higher the hits in this search metric. Delve into how these elements may yield new patients for your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<p>Every blog post should contain factual information. Citing outside sources via backlinks is one way to ensure the reader knows the claims made are accurate. Having verifiable sources that support the content in your blog is crucial to building the trust required to elevate your blog and business. If you are successful in establishing your authority, you may find other websites that link to your posts. When another webpage does this, it increases the visibility of your own through backlinking.</p>\r\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>SEO writing revolves around using keywords that search engines pick up when users enter them in the search box. Using keywords effectively in blog posts increases the likelihood of a company&#8217;s page showing up in results. Knowing the appropriate keywords to utilize when optimizing hits is an integral part of digital marketing.</p>\r\n<h3>Internal linking</h3>\r\n<p>When creating new material, you have the opportunity to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\">promote older posts</a>. Blogs remain intact on the practice&#8217;s page until deleted. If there is a shortage of ideas for new material, refresh older posts. Since the medical community is continually changing, you may update a previous post with new science. Instead of deleting the previous post, link it to the new. This is another effective way to increase views and trust for your business.</p>\r\n<h2>The time to capture business is now</h2>\r\n<p>Getting new patients should no longer depend only on referrals. Take control of your marketing through the creation of regular blog posts. Our team at Doctor Genius is standing by to answer your questions and get you started.
