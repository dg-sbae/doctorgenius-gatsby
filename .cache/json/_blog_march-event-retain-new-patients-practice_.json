While it is great when a practice brings in new patients, it is even better when the new patient decides to continue visiting the practice for health needs. Dentists can retain patients and build lasting patient relationships through specific techniques in the digital market. Fortunately, Burkhart Dental is hosting an event with speakers from our team at Doctor Genius and Nickerson Consulting.\r\n<h3>What you need to know</h3>\r\nTitled, “Are You Retaining New Patients in Your Practice?” This event takes place on Friday, March 17, 2017, at the Marriot Residence Inn 38305 Cook Street, Palm Desert, CA 92211. The event will be from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and will open registration at 8:30 a.m. for attendees. The conference will begin with a continental breakfast before our speakers take the stage to present.\r\n\r\nThe speakers will answer questions that many medical professionals in the field ask and struggle with on a regular basis. These questions include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>How do you determine a true active patient base?</li>\r\n \t<li>How do you determine new patients in your practice?</li>\r\n \t<li>How do you look at retention with new patients?</li>\r\n \t<li>How do you determine growth from these key indicators?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRetaining patients can be difficult for a practice of any medical background. While there are a variety of possible techniques for retaining patients and building a consistent amount of patients, not all techniques will be the most effective. This event will help to offer insight into which techniques are more effective in helping with patient retention.\r\n<h3>Guest speakers</h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-386\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h5><strong>“Are You Retaining New Patients in Your Practice?” This event takes place on Friday, March 17, 2017, at the Marriot Residence Inn 38305 Cook Street, Palm Desert, CA 92211.</strong></h5>\r\nThere are three main speakers at the event, two of which are speakers from the Doctor Genius team.

When people hear a company or service mention Search Engine Optimization, SEO, many automatically assume that it is black magic or a hat full of cheap parlor tricks. At Doctor Genius, we have no ulterior motives or cheap tricks hidden up our sleeves. With the proper SEO services backing up a practice, the owner of the practice will experience an increase of influence and reach in the digital landscape.\r\n<h3>The need to know about SEO</h3>\r\nOne main tip that can help clients understand SEO is that there is no shortcut to success. Any SEO service that states a website only needs more keywords to reach a larger audience or to purchase more links is not truly going to help the company’s website. Google recently posted a video on the subject of hiring an SEO company, presented by Developer Programs Tech Lead, Maile Ohye.\r\n\r\nOhye covers several key factors that people need to search for when considering investing in SEO services. The truth is that an SEO company can only do so much with any given website.  “An SEO’s potential is only as high as the quality of your business or website,” Ohye states. Ohye also highlights the fact that an SEO company “Looks to improve the entire searcher experience” from “search results to clicking on your website and potentially converting.” A few services that can help clients achieve this through the use of SEO services include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>A mobile-friendly website</li>\r\n \t<li>Good navigation</li>\r\n \t<li>Tools to build a great brand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt takes time for an SEO company, such as Doctor Genius, to develop or enhance a website and lead to a positive increase in the client’s practice. In fact, as Ohye states, SEO companies need “four months to a year to help your business first implement improvements and then see potential benefits.” Another key component for any company to consider when investing in SEO is that the entire company needs to be committed to the SEO improvements.\r\n<h5><em>“An SEO’s potential is only as high as the quality of your business or website,” –Maile Ohye</em></h5>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/piSvFxV_M04\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<h3>Put in the effort to watch a company grow</h3>\r\nWith a multitude of methods for improving a company’s online presence through SEO, there are also factors to get the best use out of SEO. Other tips for possible clients who are wary of investing in SEO services that Ohye states include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Conducting a two-way interview between the SEO company and the client</li>\r\n \t<li>Being prepared to answer some questions about one’s business that the SEO company may ask</li>\r\n \t<li>Being prepared to receive feedback from an audit on the company and the rates for improving specific areas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we build clients a new website and cover many more aspects than simply placing keywords in the right places. As Ohye states in her video, one of our main goals is to help clients identify their target patient demographic and track how those patients search specific terms online. We use honest methods to help our clients rank online with quality content.
