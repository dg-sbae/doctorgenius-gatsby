Washing your hands might help you keep the virus away, but it will not bring more customers to your business.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping your business moving forward during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>This article will go over tactics you can use to keep your business above water as you navigate around the uncertainty created by the coronavirus. Here are simple ways to positively impact your business and customers.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Use automated lead processes</h3>\r\n<p>Business owners should already have automated lead generation systems in place. If your business does not already have one, now is a good time to start. Such systems can easily help you double your sales and bring in extra revenue that might help keep the doors of your business open.</p>\r\n<p>Businesses without automated ways to generate leads are essentially running up a hill. They often end up spending more money to generate fewer leads. Automating the process allows business owners to sell their products and services even when the business is closed.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Streamline systems and use fewer workers</h3>\r\n<p>It is typically easier to manage a system than it is to manage individuals. People tend to become more unreliable during stressful times, and having a system in place makes it easier to determine which employees are contributing the most. It also allows them to work more efficiently.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Provide safeguards for customers</h3>\r\n<p>With so much uncertainty going around, providing safeguards for customers will make them more likely to purchase your business&#8217;s products and services. Let customers know how your business is adapting to the coronavirus and what will happen if you are not able to fulfill your end of the contract due to the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Understanding how potential customers have been affected by the coronavirus can also help increase your sales. For example, providing payment plans can be helpful when dealing with customers whose income has been limited by COVID-19. Surveys are a great way to get into the minds of potential customers and understand their concerns. The business can then implement safeguards that address these concerns.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Use high-quality copy</h3>\r\n<p>People being quarantined due to the coronavirus means that they are spending more time online. Having a website or web marketing system gives business owners a huge competitive advantage right now.</p>\r\n<p>Marketing tactics like search engine optimization will bring traffic to a business, but that is only half the battle. Engaging copy on your website is what builds trust with the person and prompts them to make a purchase. It involves placing relevant content at the top of the page.</p>\r\n<p>Focusing on the quantity of content on a website over quality rarely ever works out for the business. People will not trust your business if you have poorly written content on your site, and you will not generate much revenue with weak sales pitches.</p>\r\n<h2>Take advantage of new opportunities</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 brings its share of challenges, but it also brings many opportunities that smart business owners can take advantage of for their benefit. Contact Doctor Genius to learn more about how your business can survive the coronavirus by increasing your focus on internet marketing.</p>\r\n<p><em>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

With this in mind, dental practices are wondering how to proceed in a post-COVID-19 world. Our team at Doctor Genius is here to help practices go over what they will need to help reach patients and go over the new process for dental treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Now, more than ever, it is crucial for practices to send out the right message to patients. Doctor Genius can help.</p>\r\n<h3>Following the Latest State Mandates and Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>Since each state has different mandates for dental practices and quarantine regulations, it is essential for dental practices to remain on top of it. The <a href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/covid-19-state-mandates-and-recommendations?utm_source=cpsorg&amp;utm_medium=covid-cps-virus-lp&amp;utm_content=state-mandates&amp;utm_campaign=covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ADA Center for Professional Success&#x2122;</a> is keeping track of each state and what is allowed when it comes to dental services.</p>\r\n<p>Since each state is unique, there are a variety of changes and steps that dental practices will need to take. Along with that, we can help go over how to express these changes to patients in a positive way. We can offer you support during these challenging times, which will still have an impact on society well after the quarantine is lifted.</p>\r\n<p>This only increases the notion that practices need to have a plan for re-opening. A recent Doctor Genius Webinar covers the details about developing a plan for dental practices known as the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius-1.wistia.com/medias/5yv90rvx3c\" target=\" _blank\">Practice Recovery Blueprint</a>. Along with helping to set up a plan, we can help you capture the message your practice sends to patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Building Your Message to Patients</h3>\r\n<p>While having an active website with constantly updating content relevant to your practice is important, there are new questions that patients will have in a post-COVID-19 world. These questions can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n\t<li>What are the new hours?</li>\r\n\t<li>Can I schedule an appointment this week?</li>\r\n\t<li>What constitutes a dental emergency?</li>\r\n\t<li>Should I try to put my tooth back in if it falls out?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do I need to wear a facemask in the lobby?</li>\r\n\t<li>If my child is receiving dental care, can I wait in the lobby?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are only a few of the possible questions patients may have. At Doctor Genius, we understand this is a stressful time for dentists and patients alike. Thus, it is the perfect time to talk with us about developing a message and content to reach out to your community. Patients will be looking for advice on scheduling, sudden oral health issues, oral hygiene, and follow-up care. We can help provide content that uses SEO keywords pertaining to your practice along with any guidelines or information you need patients to know.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius will strive to help equip you with the tools, content, and platform necessary to become a source of information for the current and potential patients within your community. We have the right content to help your patients understand when, where, and how to reach you with changes in everything.

The global pandemic continues to claim more lives as each day passes, and it has disrupted manufacturing and businesses in ways we have never seen before. Many businesses have been slowed down to a halt, while others have to reduce their hours of operation.</p>\r\n<p>Without a doubt, this pandemic will bring significant changes to our lives, as it proves how unprepared the world is for such events. COVID-19 brings the apocalypse for many businesses, but others will be able to use the disruption to their advantage.</p>\r\n<h2>Marketing in a world with COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Figuring out the right ways to market a business might seem like rocket science. Still, the fundamentals of digital marketing can help your business make it through the current economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Here are simple things you can do to ensure that people can find your business online:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Social media marketing</h3>\r\n<p>Social media is where billions of people all over the globe connect on online platforms. Social media marketing might seem intimidating if it is not something you use personally, but many of these platforms are easy to figure out. If you are one of those people who have a hard time navigating the internet, take online classes to familiarize yourself with the social media platform you plan to use or hire a social media manager.</p>\r\n<p>Think of social media as a place you can share your thoughts, products, and services. Consistently post information that provides value, and your following will grow. A huge following allows you to send information about your business to a large number of people in a matter of seconds. You can also use direct messages to market products and services or network with other business owners who might have helpful information.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Create videos</h3>\r\n<p>Video marketing is another great way to market your business. Business owners can do this by making video tutorials targeting keywords relevant to their business. For example, a dentist who runs their practice can create step-by-step tutorials on the proper way to floss. People looking to improve their flossing technique enter keywords into a search engine. The tutorial created by the dentist pops up, and the patient gets the information they need from a credible source. YouTube is a great place to start with marketing videos.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Create a blog with a focus on search engine optimization</h3>\r\n<p>A web-blog also helps you reach a wider audience. Many business owners are hesitant to start one because they feel that the many other pages online will drown theirs out, but that only happens when you do not include search engine optimization as part of your marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<p>A good SEO strategy allows you to drive organic traffic to your blog. There are no limits to how much traffic a business can bring in using SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>The fundamentals will get you past COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Stick to the fundaments of digital marketing, and your business will be more likely to survive the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Call or email Doctor Genius to learn more about how we can help you to keep your business running while the world deals with COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p><em>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
