This increased risk can make it mentally, physically, and emotionally taxing on healthcare workers as they treat patients. Fortunately, there are support resources available to help those who may find their job to be more demanding than usual.</p>\r\n<h2>The Importance of support for medical teams</h2>\r\n<p>All too often, the health and well-being of medical teams get overlooked during times of crisis. The jobs of medical professionals are far more challenging because they often treat patients who may have contagious conditions such as COVID-19. For many, this causes increased anxiety and distress, which can affect short-term and long-term well-being.</p>\r\n<p>It is crucial for medical teams to have support resources available to them, so they can deal with any negative mental, physical, or emotional concerns they have. Many medical workers begin to feel more anxious, experience extreme fatigue, and become more fearful as they treat patients who may have COVID-19. Support resources help them deal with these concerns and be at their healthiest mental and physical state so they can do their jobs to the best of their ability. </p>\r\n<h3>Resources for mental, physical and emotional support</h3>\r\n<p>There are many support resources available to medical teams. In addition to seeking assistance from others within the practice, workers can find support from the following resources:</p>\r\n<p>American Psychiatric Association (APA): <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/well-being-and-burnout/well-being-resources\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/well-being-and-burnout/well-being-resources\">The APA</a> offers well-being resources for healthcare workers who may experience burnout, anxiety, depression, and more.</p>\r\n<p>American Medical Association (AMA): <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/managing-mental-health-during-covid-19\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/managing-mental-health-during-covid-19\">The AMA</a> has special resources designed for medical workers to take care of themselves, as well as insights into how practices can provide assistance for their staff.</p>\r\n<p>World Health Organization (WHO): Resources such as <a href=\"https://www.who.int/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.who.int/\">WHO</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a> are a great place to learn more about COVID-19. </p>\r\n<p>Health Care Toolbox: <a href=\"https://www.healthcaretoolbox.org/pediatric-traumatic-stress/14-health-care-toolbox/tools-and-resources.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthcaretoolbox.org/pediatric-traumatic-stress/14-health-care-toolbox/tools-and-resources.html\">The Health Care Toolbox </a>offers resources for medical professionals who deal with COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Headspace: <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> is a unique app that allows medical workers to de-stress after a long day and get a better night&#8217;s sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Every medical worker should look out for their health and well-being as we fight COVID-19. Practices should also ensure that their staff has all the resources they need to cope mentally and physically during this time.</p>\r\n<h3>Tips for medical workers on coping with COVID-19</h3>\r\n<p>Most importantly, medical workers should take a moment each day to evaluate their mental and physical state. Putting coping strategies into place, such as eating healthy, staying active, and interacting with loved ones, can help workers deal with the challenge COVID-19 poses. It is essential to communicate with others within your medical team, especially those in a position of leadership if you are feeling mentally or physically overwhelmed. </p>\r\n<h2>Talk to Doctor Genius for more information</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius offers free COVID-19 resources to practices and medical teams who have the task of treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The content on a website can help to bring in potential patients through using keywords, SEO, and posting content regularly. At Doctor Genius, we can provide a steady flow of content to a client’s website, as well as managing the site as a whole. Therefore, as Google has just launched another core update, we are preparing for any changes that may come with its new algorithm.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within this new update, your website may experience changes in search results and the number of people who view your website. Here is what we know about the update and how we are here to help ensure the most effective search results for your practice’s website.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What We Know</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-may-2020-core-update-was-big-and-broad-search-data-tools-show-334393?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWW1GallqRmxNakZoWkdFdyIsInQiOiIrRWRcL2c0UklNT1orRUZkNnFyUjkwTDhqRzdXQmt0ZHZ1bUl6V2R1dklYSnhiWFJPdHNyZTlMOGo0VnRCRnBGWVNIRkFGOUVXRlZobDlibVRHd0pUN0JMaWtwczd4UlgrTTY0MGNGaVBZazczZDh1eDR3bTJETVdrMWlyY2tQZTIifQ%3D%3D\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Land</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this update went into effect on May 4th, 2020, and is one of the largest the internet has seen in a while. Core updates, as opposed to daily updates, tend to happen every few months and are not meant to be a method of restricting or limiting web traffic to certain pages. However, it can be challenging to completely map out what the changes are with the update and how they will affect your website. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It usually takes a few months before data analysts can determine the full effects of a core update. However, internal trends are usually reported within a few weeks. At this moment, Doctor Genius’ client base shows positive results for online traffic following the core update. Since the update began, </span><b>our clients have seen more than a 20%</b><b><i> increase</i></b><b> in organic page views and organic sessions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In other words, the recent uptick in our client’s online performance is likely due to Google’s May algorithm change. </span></p>\r\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How This May Effect Your Practice</span></i></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/08/core-updates.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Webmaster Central Blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> explains that the core update involves changes that “are about improving how our systems assess content overall,” further stating that “These changes may cause some pages that were previously under-rewarded to do better.” However, it can also cause certain pages to not receive as much traffic. In these instances, it helps to have a team that can further assess the situation and adapt to any changes.</span></p>\r\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You Can Do to Stay Ahead of Algorithm Changes</span></i></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to staying ahead of these Google algorithm changes, there are several possible steps one can take. The main area of focus should always be on the quality of content. While keywords can help certain pages rank in search results, the algorithm continues to change to better track spam or other pages that do not deliver quality content. Semrush.com quotes Google in saying that these </span><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/google-may-2020-core-update/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">core updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are “designed to ensure that overall, we’re delivering on our mission to present relevant and authoritative content to searchers.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can help create original content for your website with the purpose to both express the message you want to send and help target patient needs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our marketing and production teams are constantly reviewing content and help send the right message for each client. As we anticipate Google’s algorithm to constantly be updated to reward quality content, we work proactively to update our client’s pages with the information on the latest technology and answers to the new consumer needs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also work to improve on how we structure content to meet the needs of more users’ queries. In congruence with what experts say about SEO best practices, we constantly provide client&#8217;s new material because Google’s search values unique content. All of our efforts also adhere to the quality factors stated in Google’s Central Webmaster Blog:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing original information</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Containing a complete and comprehensive description of the topic</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring the title or headline of pages is descriptive of the topic</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the proper resources and citations</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping deliver a personalized and unique message</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Groups Who Were Most Affected by Search </span></i></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the major questions people have with each update is who benefits from this and who is taking a hit in the number of page views. Semrush.com explains that “the most influenced categories are Travel, Real Estate, Health, Pets &amp; Animals, and People &amp; Society.” Commonly known as the winners and losers of the update, it seems that websites focusing on news, business and industrial, online communication, and health experienced their own levels of increase in views.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semrush.com further explains that the entertainment websites promoting offline entertainment took the biggest hit and are on the losing side of the update. Since more people are remaining inside and most businesses have restrictions, it can be difficult to offer specific services. Medical practices are also experiencing limitations due to quarantine. However, an outcome of Covid-19 has been google favoring medical providers who offer virtual consultations. Additionally, we have personally seen an uptick in demand for dental services during the first months of the pandemic, as mentioned in our </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blueprint to recovery</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can help to adapt and tailor the content of your website to reflect both your practice services and the content that will attract more views. Especially following the COVID-19 pandemic and the quarantine regulations across the world, it is crucial for medical practices to have an effective online platform for reaching potential and current patients. For a website to help do this, there needs to be a regular flow of content to display activity.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach Patients with Your Message</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will take the time to understand your needs and desire for how you want to present your website to patients.

These changes are focused on helping enhance how Google measures the content of a page to determine where it ends up in search results lists. This update can have a positive or negative effect on search results for certain types of services and fields in the market.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>How Often Does Google Release Core Updates? </b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, the update can be every few months. The last update was in January of 2020. This update seems to be the largest update in a while as sources determine that it took around two weeks to finish updating.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>What is E-A-T? </b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-A-T stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. This acronym applies to page quality for webpages, blogs, and articles posted online. This acronym covers the three areas of focus for determining if the content will meet the guidelines of the algorithm update. Doctor Genius can help clients to stay on top of these updates.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>What is the Difference Between a Google Core Update and Regular Updates?</b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Google Core Updates only happen several times a year, there are much smaller updates and tweaks at least once per day. These routine updates can affect ranking but tend to only have a marginal effect on search results.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
