For many patients,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/posting-blogs-on-open-enrollment/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that insurance plays a vital role in patients getting needed healthcare services. For many patients, financial difficulties limit what care is available, and having a reliable insurance policy can help overcome this barrier. As a physician or other healthcare provider it is necessary that you inform patients about open enrollment periods and help them find policies that work well for each unique situation. This medical marketing strategy ensures that your patients are able to continue using your practice for essential health needs.</p>\r\n<h2>FAQs about open enrollment</h2>\r\n<p>Many doctors tend to stay away from any discussion about insurance with patients. However, it is important that you inform patients when open enrollment is available so that you can be an advocate for your patients getting the care they deserve. When patients are not concerned about financial barriers to care, your practice will see more appointments made and procedures accepted. </p>\r\n<h3>What is open enrollment?</h3>\r\n<p>There is a narrow window of time that insurance companies allow patients to sign up for policies. It often only happens once a year, so it is important that patients do not miss the opportunity. Sometimes insurance companies host an enrollment day at the patient&#8217;s job if the company has a group health plan. Other times, though, the patient may be required to contact the insurance company individually. For patients turning 65, assistance with signing up for a Medicare policy can be beneficial.</p>\r\n<h3>Why is it an important marketing strategy? </h3>\r\n<p>To establish a credible, trusting relationship with your patients, you must be able to guide them through every part of receiving healthcare. Insurance coverage is one thing that many patients struggle with. By informing your patients of available insurance options and making sure that they sign up on time, you are securing that patient in your practice for the coming year. You do not want to lose an established patient simply because they forgot to sign back up on an insurance plan and can no longer afford your services. </p>\r\n<h3>How can a practice get the word out to patients?</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to reminding patients at every appointment when insurance enrollment will begin, having a practice blog can greatly benefit you. According to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY\">NBC News</a>, approximately 80% of internet users have looked up some type of health information online. We are living in a connected society, and it is important that you have a place for your patients to read credible health information. <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">Your blog</a> can also be a great outlet for reminding patients of things like open enrollment, and updating it often helps your patients feel more connected to your practice at all times.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about our services</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is committed to providing effective SEO marketing strategies for your practice.

There are many ways to boost audience engagement and connect with new viewers, but not every form of content fits all business models. Understanding what type of content to create that best suits your customers can help you develop a larger audience faster.</p>\r\n<h2>Content formats for optimizing your digital marketing strategy  </h2>\r\n<p>In this day and age, there is practically no way for a business that wants to succeed to avoid using a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/matzucker/2019/11/14/whats-in-a-digital-marketing-strategy/#29f6d7ae68b2\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/matzucker/2019/11/14/whats-in-a-digital-marketing-strategy/#29f6d7ae68b2\">digital marketing strategy</a>. Too many consumers are online and engaged in social media not to take advantage of it, but failing to know where your audience lies in the massive online community can waste any strategy, no matter how good it may seem on paper. Determining the right content format for your business is the first step in reaching the right audience. Here are some popular and useful options to consider.</p>\r\n<h3>Blog posts</h3>\r\n<p>When brainstorming ideas for your next marketing promotion, blog posts have more than likely made the list. Blogs are popular for many good reasons, as they can be incredibly successful in conveying important information to a variety of readers. There are endless types of posts that can be used to your advantage, like guides, lists, reviews, and how-to articles. However, a blog post has its limitations, and other forms of content may connect better with your audience.</p>\r\n<h3>Videos</h3>\r\n<p>There is no question why video platforms, such as YouTube, have remained successful for so many years. People of all ages watch videos for both entertainment and learning purposes. Videos are one of the easiest ways for viewers to absorb new content, which makes them an excellent resource for businesses looking to expand marketing. From ads to tutorials, you can use a video to address your audience about almost anything.</p>\r\n<h3>Research</h3>\r\n<p>Research that a business does itself and reports is more likely to get shared and viewed than research you report from someone else. Getting shares can skyrocket search engine optimization via backlinks and by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\">establishing greater credibility</a>. Conducting a survey can not only help your own business grow but may be of great interest to others in your niche.</p>\r\n<h3>Infographics</h3>\r\n<p>Infographics combine pictures and words to generate engaging content that gets to the point quickly. They are easy to follow, visually appealing, and loaded with helpful information that a reader can easily digest. The amount of time viewers spend looking at a single piece of content continues to decrease, so crafting content that gets the main points across without hassle is ideal in today’s fast-paced media.</p>\r\n<h2>Explore more content forms for marketing</h2>\r\n<p>These are only a handful of possible content formats to consider for your business. Discussing your specific clientele needs directly with a professional can help narrow down a successful marketing strategy. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for more information on content formats and to get help planning your next promotional campaign.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Furthermore, a practice that invests in marketing spending has a much higher chance of surpassing their competitors. Here are some important ways it can help your practice thrive.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a brand</h2>\r\n<p>Brand differentiation, or distinguishing yourself from the rest, may seem more the purview of high-end fashion companies. Still, it is one of the most essential goals marketing spending can achieve. Which dentist is a consumer going to choose, the one who has a stellar reputation or the one who is just a “normal dentist”? Of course, there is no substitute for quality work, but marketing spending can amplify the service you provide and help your practice grow.</p>\r\n<p>Brand building in a consumer-savvy market may be difficult, but consider that one of your greatest assets are your people. In a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx\">Gallup survey</a> of more than 1,600 customers in three different service categories, researchers found that one of the biggest determining factors that affected a consumer’s decision to stay loyal to a brand was their interactions with customer-facing employees.</p>\r\n<p>In your practice, you and your employees are the ones who are fulfilling the promise that your brand makes. If consumers have a positive experience with you that reinforces that branding in your advertising, they will be more likely to come back and recommend the practice to others.</p>\r\n<p>Another creative way to build a brand is through <a title=\"Backlink\" href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\">content marketing</a>. Many consumers are tired of being bombarded by ads trying to sell them something, but content marketing allows your practice to present helpful information to a potential customer through a blog or video. This way the customer connects the helpful content to you and your practice and will be more likely to think of you when they need services. It also provides the opportunity for you to build an original brand through your content.</p>\r\n<h2>Effective advertising</h2>\r\n<p>In the digital age, there are myriad avenues of advertisement. No longer can practices only advertise on television or radio; they must also consider the various advertising opportunities on the internet. Whether social media, search engine, or pay-per-click advertising, the right choice is determined by your practice and your competition. Either way, it is strongly recommended that part of your marketing budget be dedicated to digital advertising even when marketing during recessions. More specific examples of digital advertising are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Facebook ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Google search ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Search engine optimization </li>\r\n\t<li>Geo-targeted ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Social media posts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Which type of ad is most effective depends on the practice, but it is a good idea to consider using a mix of ads rather than spending all your resources on one platform.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you organize your marketing spending</h2>\r\n<p>Each practice has different marketing needs.
