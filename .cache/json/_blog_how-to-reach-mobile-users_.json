What was once considered just one small part of the online <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">marketing equation</a> has now become one of the main methods of communication for an entire generation of consumers. Content that is optimized specifically for mobile users is a vital addition to the marketing plan of businesses in every industry. </p>\r\n<h2>Reaching mobile users through mobile marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Finding innovative ways to reach mobile users is not just a short-lived marketing trend. To remain competitive in a generation of mobile-focused consumers, businesses and health care practices must continuously rethink online strategies. </p>\r\n<h3>Mobile optimization</h3>\r\n<p>In the past, businesses focused on webpages that would likely be viewed on a computer. Building an option for the mobile view was secondary and, in most cases, did not include the same amount of information, often requiring the customer to view the full site for more material and additional details. Users want a mobile site that loads quickly, offers easy navigation, is pleasing to the eye, and provides engaging content. This makes it important to check back frequently for mobile site errors and review for user-friendliness using test groups. </p>\r\n<h3>Search engine optimization keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that when building a mobile-optimized site, SEO keywords are still just as crucial as on a traditional website. Since most Google searches are now completed on mobile devices, the Google Webmaster Central Blog reports that the <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html\">search engine indexing</a> system has evolved to prioritize these searches. Whereas website users are willing to browse through several options in the search queue, mobile users rarely select options beyond the first few that become available. This trend in preference makes SEO keyword selection and use more vital than ever. </p>\r\n<h3>Voice command popularity</h3>\r\n<p>Mobile users are no longer relying solely on text and images to gain information. The rising popularity in voice command technology has made SEO keyword usage a priority for mobile site design. When users activate voice command and make a request, the keywords are analyzed and search results index accordingly. Making sure related keywords are present on the mobile site or app means a higher likelihood of coming up on that index. </p>\r\n<h3>App design and utilization</h3>\r\n<p>For some mobile users, an optimized site is not enough to stay engaged. Repeat customers benefit from the development of an app that is user-friendly and interactive. Along with an app that stands out, the integration of SEO keywords using terminology that is specifically reserved for apps increases the likelihood of the app coming up in a search. App store optimization keywords are a new frontier that many businesses are just now learning to explore, so during the design process, it helps to research the ASO keywords most frequently used in the specific business field. </p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about mobile marketing for your business</h2>\r\n<p>Flexibility in your marketing techniques is essential for maintaining relevance with your target audience as technology rapidly changes.

However, the saying that all press is good press<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Word-of-mouth marketing is undoubtedly important for every business, large and small. However, the saying that all press is good press is not true. Negative WOM is very damaging to a brand’s reputation and bottom line, especially when the brand in question is an “underdog.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>The effects of negative WOM marketing</strong></p>\r\n<p>WOM marketing relies on first-hand accounts of a person’s experience with a business. First-hand accounts are immediately more credible than typical marketing, as consumers do not get paid to leave reviews. Brands use positive testimonials to attract new customers for this reason. However, whereas positive reviews increase trust and influence purchases, negative reviews have an adverse effect. Below are just a few ways NWOM can undermine the results from all other marketing efforts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Change in attitude toward a brand</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the findings from a study conducted by a <a href=\"https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;context=honors_theses\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;context=honors_theses\">University of New Orleans</a>, consumers’ attitudes toward a brand are adversely impacted by negative reviews. The study focused on both “top dogs” and “underdogs.” While both big and small businesses saw a negative impact from public criticism, the underdogs suffered more from bad press than larger corporations. Additionally, participants’ perceived brand value decreased when they were presented with negative information about a company. Again, the drop was more significant for small brands than large ones.</p>\r\n<p>What is interesting is that positive reviews had little to no effect on participants’ perceptions of brands. This finding shows just how powerful negative word-of-mouth can be.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Change in purchase intention</strong></p>\r\n<p>Negative WOM does not just hurt a brand’s reputation. It also hurts a company’s bottom line. According to the study, negative reviews influenced participants not to make the purchase. Positive testimonials, however, had little to no impact on individuals’ purchase decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Findings from a <a href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/studies/online-negative-word-of-mouth.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/studies/online-negative-word-of-mouth.html\">Spiegel Research Center</a> study back those from the university: according to the center, individuals who viewed NWOM about a brand decreased their spending by 12% and their spending frequency by 5%.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Difficult to overcome</strong></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most frustrating thing about NWOM is its persistence. The impact of negative word-of-mouth marketing persists for far longer than the results of positive WOM. According to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322632227_Negative_Word-of-Mouth_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Adverse_Messages_on_Consumers'_Reactions_on_Facebook\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322632227_Negative_Word-of-Mouth_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Adverse_Messages_on_Consumers'_Reactions_on_Facebook\">2017 paper</a>, the impact of bad press persists long after it has been refuted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Managing your reputation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Reputation management is critical to the success of your practice.

In fact, according to HubSpot, more businesses actively invest in <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">online content creation</a> (70%) than those that invest in search engine marketing strategies (64%). Because so many brands focus on content creation, the online landscape is more saturated with content than ever before. To break through all the noise and ensure your brand comes out on top, you need to take a deep dive into your audience’s habits and behaviors to gain a better understanding of the type of content it really wants to see.</p>\r\n<h2>Top 3 reasons to tailor your online content to your general audience</h2>\r\n<p>In the early days of content marketing, brands used content simply as a means of funneling leads to their sites. Rarely did brands focus on filling their landing pages with quality and helpful content. While this tactic may have worked way back when, it will not fly today. Today, speaking to one’s general audience is more important to online success than ever. Below are the top three reasons this is true.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Identify more appropriate keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Though SEO takes a backseat to targeted content, there is still value in keyword research and placement. After all, if you do not use the right keywords, you will struggle to reach your target audience. While an SEO agency can help you perform thorough keyword research, a large part of <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/key-prosperous-practiceare-using-effective-keywords/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/key-prosperous-practiceare-using-effective-keywords/\">identifying appropriate terms and phrases</a> entails knowing your audience.  </p>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/audiences-vs-keywords/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/audiences-vs-keywords/\">Neil Patel</a>, the best way for brands to sabotage their content marketing strategy is to target everyone. By targeting everyone, brands attract no one. Instead, companies should seek to understand what words and phrases their unique audiences use to search for their products and services. In doing so, they may limit the number of searches in which they show up, but they increase their odds of showing up in searches conducted by more serious leads.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Increase engagement</h3>\r\n<p>Attracting leads to your website is only half the battle. The other half entails engaging visitors enough to convince them to do business with you. If your visitors do not care about what you have to say, it is highly unlikely they will care about what you have to sell. The best way to engage audiences is to identify their unique pain points, wants, and concerns, and craft content around those.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Build relationships</h3>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most important reason to speak to your general audience is to build relationships and brand loyalty. Remember, online competition is fierce. For consumers, supply is not the problem. The problem lies in deciding in which brand to place one’s loyalty.</p>\r\n<p>Set your business apart from the competition by communicating with your audience on an intimate and authentic level. Though doing so will require considerably more effort than merely pumping out generic content, your efforts will pay off, as defined audiences are quicker to dedicate their loyalty because they feel as though they are truly appreciated.</p>\r\n<h2>Start defining your target audience today</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is ranked No. 1 in new patient acquisitions for a reason: We understand the health care industry, the digital realm, and patients’ wants and expectations.
