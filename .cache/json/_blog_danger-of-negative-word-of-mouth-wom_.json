However, the saying that all press is good press is not true. Negative WOM is very damaging to a brand’s reputation and bottom line, especially when the brand in question is an “underdog.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>The effects of negative WOM marketing</strong></p>\r\n<p>WOM marketing relies on first-hand accounts of a person’s experience with a business. First-hand accounts are immediately more credible than typical marketing, as consumers do not get paid to leave reviews. Brands use positive testimonials to attract new customers for this reason. However, whereas positive reviews increase trust and influence purchases, negative reviews have an adverse effect. Below are just a few ways NWOM can undermine the results from all other marketing efforts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Change in attitude toward a brand</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the findings from a study conducted by a <a href=\"https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;context=honors_theses\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;context=honors_theses\">University of New Orleans</a>, consumers’ attitudes toward a brand are adversely impacted by negative reviews. The study focused on both “top dogs” and “underdogs.” While both big and small businesses saw a negative impact from public criticism, the underdogs suffered more from bad press than larger corporations. Additionally, participants’ perceived brand value decreased when they were presented with negative information about a company. Again, the drop was more significant for small brands than large ones.</p>\r\n<p>What is interesting is that positive reviews had little to no effect on participants’ perceptions of brands. This finding shows just how powerful negative word-of-mouth can be.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Change in purchase intention</strong></p>\r\n<p>Negative WOM does not just hurt a brand’s reputation. It also hurts a company’s bottom line. According to the study, negative reviews influenced participants not to make the purchase. Positive testimonials, however, had little to no impact on individuals’ purchase decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Findings from a <a href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/studies/online-negative-word-of-mouth.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/studies/online-negative-word-of-mouth.html\">Spiegel Research Center</a> study back those from the university: according to the center, individuals who viewed NWOM about a brand decreased their spending by 12% and their spending frequency by 5%.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Difficult to overcome</strong></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most frustrating thing about NWOM is its persistence. The impact of negative word-of-mouth marketing persists for far longer than the results of positive WOM. According to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322632227_Negative_Word-of-Mouth_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Adverse_Messages_on_Consumers'_Reactions_on_Facebook\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322632227_Negative_Word-of-Mouth_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Adverse_Messages_on_Consumers'_Reactions_on_Facebook\">2017 paper</a>, the impact of bad press persists long after it has been refuted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Managing your reputation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Reputation management is critical to the success of your practice.

Authority. Trust. Though there are several reasons brands engage in content marketing, these are the top three. According to<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/the-importance-of-source-hyperlinks/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Expertise. Authority. Trust. Though there are several reasons brands engage in content marketing, these are the top three. According to Moz, companies strive to <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/google-e-a-t\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://moz.com/blog/google-e-a-t\">achieve E-A-T</a> for two reasons: To boost their reputations and to make Google happy. While you can use several content marketing techniques to appeal to target audiences and gain rankings, one of the simplest and best ways to do both is to hyperlink to your sources.</p>\r\n<h2>How hyperlinking helps build E-A-T</h2>\r\n<p>It is not uncommon for brands to avoid hyperlinking to the sources they use out of fear of sending visitors away from their sites. While this is a possibility, losing one or two readers is a small price to pay for establishing yourself as an authority and gaining the majority of visitors’ (and Google’s) trust. So how, exactly, does hyperlinking help build E-A-T? Below are the top four ways.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Build a network</h3>\r\n<p>If you have had other practices or industry authorities link to your content, you know just how precious a backlink can be. For each backlink you receive, you may notice a slight increase in your rankings, and you may feel a surge of gratitude that encourages you to pay the kindness forward. Other brands feel this way, too.</p>\r\n<p>By linking to other professionals within your field, as well as to industry experts, you put yourself on their radar and secure a soft spot in their hearts. When those professionals need to cite, say, a dental professional, they may think of you first. The more websites you link to, the more backlinks you stand to receive. A word of caution though: Link only to credible and relevant sites, as linking for the sake of linking could put you on Google’s radar for all the wrong reasons.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Boost credibility</h3>\r\n<p>A hyperlink is the content marketing equivalent of a footnote. Just as you had to do when writing a college paper or dissertation, cite your sources. Citing, referencing, or referring to the publications from which you gained your information tells your audience that you did your homework and are a source to be trusted.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Increase usability</h3>\r\n<p>Today’s consumers are more informed than ever before, and not because they have to be, but because they want to be. Most people do not take the information given to them at face value. They digest it, research it, and then research it some more before deciding what they want to do with it. Make things easier on your audience by applying hyperlinks to your content. Doing so allows them to easily verify your material, answer any questions they have, and find related content through which they can learn more.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Increase time-on-site</h3>\r\n<p>You do not always have to link to outside sources. If you have an extensive library of valuable content, make each piece work harder for you by sending your readers to them. In addition to including hyperlinks directly in the content, attach a list of “Related Content” at the bottom. These tactics have been proven to increase time-on-site, which also happens to improve search rankings.</p>\r\n<h2>Invest in your online reputation</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that reputation is everything for health care professionals.

Content that is optimized specifically for mobile users is a vital addition to the marketing plan of businesses in every industry. </p>\r\n<h2>Reaching mobile users through mobile marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Finding innovative ways to reach mobile users is not just a short-lived marketing trend. To remain competitive in a generation of mobile-focused consumers, businesses and health care practices must continuously rethink online strategies. </p>\r\n<h3>Mobile optimization</h3>\r\n<p>In the past, businesses focused on webpages that would likely be viewed on a computer. Building an option for the mobile view was secondary and, in most cases, did not include the same amount of information, often requiring the customer to view the full site for more material and additional details. Users want a mobile site that loads quickly, offers easy navigation, is pleasing to the eye, and provides engaging content. This makes it important to check back frequently for mobile site errors and review for user-friendliness using test groups. </p>\r\n<h3>Search engine optimization keywords</h3>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that when building a mobile-optimized site, SEO keywords are still just as crucial as on a traditional website. Since most Google searches are now completed on mobile devices, the Google Webmaster Central Blog reports that the <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html\">search engine indexing</a> system has evolved to prioritize these searches. Whereas website users are willing to browse through several options in the search queue, mobile users rarely select options beyond the first few that become available. This trend in preference makes SEO keyword selection and use more vital than ever. </p>\r\n<h3>Voice command popularity</h3>\r\n<p>Mobile users are no longer relying solely on text and images to gain information. The rising popularity in voice command technology has made SEO keyword usage a priority for mobile site design. When users activate voice command and make a request, the keywords are analyzed and search results index accordingly. Making sure related keywords are present on the mobile site or app means a higher likelihood of coming up on that index. </p>\r\n<h3>App design and utilization</h3>\r\n<p>For some mobile users, an optimized site is not enough to stay engaged. Repeat customers benefit from the development of an app that is user-friendly and interactive. Along with an app that stands out, the integration of SEO keywords using terminology that is specifically reserved for apps increases the likelihood of the app coming up in a search. App store optimization keywords are a new frontier that many businesses are just now learning to explore, so during the design process, it helps to research the ASO keywords most frequently used in the specific business field. </p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about mobile marketing for your business</h2>\r\n<p>Flexibility in your marketing techniques is essential for maintaining relevance with your target audience as technology rapidly changes.
