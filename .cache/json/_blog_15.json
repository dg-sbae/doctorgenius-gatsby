It&#8217;s almost certain that every practice and every team is experiencing new daily or weekly challenges. Throughout these trying times, we&#8217;ve been doing everything we can to make our doctor&#8217;s lives more manageable. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re proud to discuss our new course of action that helps dentists turn things back around.</p>\r\n<p>As an organization, Doctor Genius continually audits, manages, and adjusts our online strategy to what&#8217;s applicable to the times. With so much uncertainty, it&#8217;s important to identify new areas of opportunity and, more importantly, understand where the future of dentistry is headed. Ask yourself, before the pandemic, how prevalent were telehealth services in our industry? Fast forward today, and nearly all practice owners are adopting new innovative ways to reach patients and provide quality care.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, our Doctor Genius Recovery Expert, Shawn Stiffler, has the facts and information on the preventive actions you can take to sustain your practice. With a background in finance, Shawn&#8217;s expertise shines through when dealing with Dentists who don&#8217;t have a 1000 ft view of their operations and don&#8217;t know where to go.</p>\r\n<h3>Understanding What Happened to Dental Practices During Quarantine</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n<style>\r\n    .author-panel {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-direction: row;\r\n        font-size: 1.0rem;\r\n        line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-panel.card {\r\n        padding: 2.5%;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-panel p { line-height: 1.5 !important; }\r\n    .author-panel .panel-text {font-size: 14.5px !important;  }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder {\r\n        width: 25%;\r\n        margin: 1% 2.5%\r\n    }\r\n    .image-holder img, .author-info {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        max-width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n    .image-holder img {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        height: auto;\r\n        margin-bottom: 15px;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-info h5 {\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n        font-size: 100%;\r\n        text-decoration: underline\r\n    }\r\n    .author-info ul {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        padding-left: 0;\r\n        width: 100% !important;\r\n        justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-panel ul li {\r\n        list-style-type: none;\r\n        text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    }\r\n    .author-info li {\r\n        font-size: 75%;\r\n        font-style: italic;\r\n    }\r\n    .panel-text { width: 72.5%; margin-left: 2.5% }\r\n    .author-panel h5 { margin-bottom: 0)\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"author-panel card\">\r\n<div class=\"image-holder\"><img class=\"author-image\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Linkedin-Head-Shot-Shawn-Stiffler.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Stiffler\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\r\n<div class=\"author-info\">\r\n<h5>Sean Stiffler</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"Author page coming soon!\">Posts</a></li>\r\n<!--\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\">Bio</a></li>\r\n-->\r\n\t<li><a href=\"mailto:sstiffler@doctorgenius.com\">Email</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-text\">\r\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-stiffler-68947773/\">Recovery Expert, Shawn Stiffler’s</a> extensive experience in the industry has proven to help dentists take a deeper dive into their market to find areas of opportunity to increase overall practice revenue.</p>\r\n<p>For the past 5 years, Shawn and Doctor Genius have been able to turn underperforming practices into thriving businesses. But how? Taking a thorough and comprehensive analysis of industry standards, industry metrics, online presence, services offered, and the overall online strategy for your business can dramatically impact the direction your business will go.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Most recently, a study conducted by Local Med stated that, </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"padding: 0 2%;\">During quarantine, hygiene appointments weren&#8217;t happening. And that means those appointments weren&#8217;t being reappointed either. A deep dive into Dental Intelligence&#8217;s data has shown us that all across the country, hygiene chairs are less than 15% scheduled in September, October, and November.”</blockquote>\r\n<p>Just like any other area of your business, conducting a statistical analysis of your missed appointments, no shows, and gaps in scheduling are a great place to start in order to identify ways to improve and maximize the hygiene department`s productivity.</p>\r\n<h3>Why Did Appointments Dip in 2020?</h3>\r\n<p>Since March, medical <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/dont-avoid-your-doctor-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">visits have declined</a>, despite the impact doctors warn it could have on the nation’s health. Polling indicates that people are typically more fearful of going anywhere. A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/\">we looked at</a> the economic impact this is having on businesses and steps professionals can take to remain successful during a financial downturn. This is why the onus is on the dentist to schedule more appointments by reaching out to patients again.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2379\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg\" alt=\"Scheduled Hygiene Production\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-300x212.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-768x542.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-177x125.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\r\n<h3>How do we fix this?</h3>\r\n<p>By gaining more market share! We need to fill the gaps in your schedule by creating more awareness online that your practice is accepting new patients. We need to expand your online footprint and market your practice the <i>right</i> way!</p>\r\n<p>Dental Intelligence/Local Med adds that, “Normally, hygiene schedules are 80% full. But now they&#8217;re 80% empty. It&#8217;s vital to take steps now in order to be on track to see as many of your hygiene patients as possible.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>After auditing our own Doctor Genius client’s online and internal performance, we found that this was an overall trend for almost all dentists. It’s crucial to understand and correct this as soon as possible to ensure you’re maximizing each area of your dental practice in regard to consistency and improved performance over time. </p>\r\n<h3>We’re here to help!</h3>\r\n<p>Since dentists are experiencing fluctuations in scheduling hygiene appointments during the quarantine, even with rescheduling efforts, there will still be a gap of incoming patients equivalent to that gap. However, clients of Doctor Genius have an online presence and system in place to continue scheduling appointments, rescheduling appointments, and focusing on patient retention efforts.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can identify areas of opportunity to benefit a client’s practice, boost their online presence, and help increase practice sustainability during these uncertain times. With COVID-19 continuing to alter the medical landscape in numerous ways, it is crucial to have a plan that can adapt to this climate. Our team will help clients learn how to utilize their online reach to continue seeing current patients while bringing in new patients.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the process, Doctor Genius can help you know where you are, understand your gap analysis, and develop a plan for how to proceed. This can include a marketing plan for how to promote the key services you offer.</p>\r\n<p>Take your first step into discovering your local markets untapped potential <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo\">here</a><b>. </b> Contact one of our <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">support specialists</a> to get set up today.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Too many consumers are online and engaged in social media not to take advantage of it, but failing to know where your audience lies in the massive online community can waste any strategy, no matter how good it may seem on paper. Determining the right content format for your business is the first step in reaching the right audience. Here are some popular and useful options to consider.</p>\r\n<h3>Blog posts</h3>\r\n<p>When brainstorming ideas for your next marketing promotion, blog posts have more than likely made the list. Blogs are popular for many good reasons, as they can be incredibly successful in conveying important information to a variety of readers. There are endless types of posts that can be used to your advantage, like guides, lists, reviews, and how-to articles. However, a blog post has its limitations, and other forms of content may connect better with your audience.</p>\r\n<h3>Videos</h3>\r\n<p>There is no question why video platforms, such as YouTube, have remained successful for so many years. People of all ages watch videos for both entertainment and learning purposes. Videos are one of the easiest ways for viewers to absorb new content, which makes them an excellent resource for businesses looking to expand marketing. From ads to tutorials, you can use a video to address your audience about almost anything.</p>\r\n<h3>Research</h3>\r\n<p>Research that a business does itself and reports is more likely to get shared and viewed than research you report from someone else. Getting shares can skyrocket search engine optimization via backlinks and by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\">establishing greater credibility</a>. Conducting a survey can not only help your own business grow but may be of great interest to others in your niche.</p>\r\n<h3>Infographics</h3>\r\n<p>Infographics combine pictures and words to generate engaging content that gets to the point quickly. They are easy to follow, visually appealing, and loaded with helpful information that a reader can easily digest. The amount of time viewers spend looking at a single piece of content continues to decrease, so crafting content that gets the main points across without hassle is ideal in today’s fast-paced media.</p>\r\n<h2>Explore more content forms for marketing</h2>\r\n<p>These are only a handful of possible content formats to consider for your business.

For many patients,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/posting-blogs-on-open-enrollment/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that insurance plays a vital role in patients getting needed healthcare services. For many patients, financial difficulties limit what care is available, and having a reliable insurance policy can help overcome this barrier. As a physician or other healthcare provider it is necessary that you inform patients about open enrollment periods and help them find policies that work well for each unique situation. This medical marketing strategy ensures that your patients are able to continue using your practice for essential health needs.</p>\r\n<h2>FAQs about open enrollment</h2>\r\n<p>Many doctors tend to stay away from any discussion about insurance with patients. However, it is important that you inform patients when open enrollment is available so that you can be an advocate for your patients getting the care they deserve. When patients are not concerned about financial barriers to care, your practice will see more appointments made and procedures accepted. </p>\r\n<h3>What is open enrollment?</h3>\r\n<p>There is a narrow window of time that insurance companies allow patients to sign up for policies. It often only happens once a year, so it is important that patients do not miss the opportunity. Sometimes insurance companies host an enrollment day at the patient&#8217;s job if the company has a group health plan. Other times, though, the patient may be required to contact the insurance company individually. For patients turning 65, assistance with signing up for a Medicare policy can be beneficial.</p>\r\n<h3>Why is it an important marketing strategy? </h3>\r\n<p>To establish a credible, trusting relationship with your patients, you must be able to guide them through every part of receiving healthcare. Insurance coverage is one thing that many patients struggle with. By informing your patients of available insurance options and making sure that they sign up on time, you are securing that patient in your practice for the coming year. You do not want to lose an established patient simply because they forgot to sign back up on an insurance plan and can no longer afford your services. </p>\r\n<h3>How can a practice get the word out to patients?</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to reminding patients at every appointment when insurance enrollment will begin, having a practice blog can greatly benefit you. According to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/#.XzcH0-hKhPY\">NBC News</a>, approximately 80% of internet users have looked up some type of health information online. We are living in a connected society, and it is important that you have a place for your patients to read credible health information. <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">Your blog</a> can also be a great outlet for reminding patients of things like open enrollment, and updating it often helps your patients feel more connected to your practice at all times.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about our services</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is committed to providing effective SEO marketing strategies for your practice.

Furthermore, a practice that invests in marketing spending has a much higher chance of surpassing their competitors. Here are some important ways it can help your practice thrive.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a brand</h2>\r\n<p>Brand differentiation, or distinguishing yourself from the rest, may seem more the purview of high-end fashion companies. Still, it is one of the most essential goals marketing spending can achieve. Which dentist is a consumer going to choose, the one who has a stellar reputation or the one who is just a “normal dentist”? Of course, there is no substitute for quality work, but marketing spending can amplify the service you provide and help your practice grow.</p>\r\n<p>Brand building in a consumer-savvy market may be difficult, but consider that one of your greatest assets are your people. In a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/229/building-brand-differentiation.aspx\">Gallup survey</a> of more than 1,600 customers in three different service categories, researchers found that one of the biggest determining factors that affected a consumer’s decision to stay loyal to a brand was their interactions with customer-facing employees.</p>\r\n<p>In your practice, you and your employees are the ones who are fulfilling the promise that your brand makes. If consumers have a positive experience with you that reinforces that branding in your advertising, they will be more likely to come back and recommend the practice to others.</p>\r\n<p>Another creative way to build a brand is through <a title=\"Backlink\" href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\">content marketing</a>. Many consumers are tired of being bombarded by ads trying to sell them something, but content marketing allows your practice to present helpful information to a potential customer through a blog or video. This way the customer connects the helpful content to you and your practice and will be more likely to think of you when they need services. It also provides the opportunity for you to build an original brand through your content.</p>\r\n<h2>Effective advertising</h2>\r\n<p>In the digital age, there are myriad avenues of advertisement. No longer can practices only advertise on television or radio; they must also consider the various advertising opportunities on the internet. Whether social media, search engine, or pay-per-click advertising, the right choice is determined by your practice and your competition. Either way, it is strongly recommended that part of your marketing budget be dedicated to digital advertising even when marketing during recessions. More specific examples of digital advertising are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Facebook ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Google search ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Search engine optimization </li>\r\n\t<li>Geo-targeted ads</li>\r\n\t<li>Social media posts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Which type of ad is most effective depends on the practice, but it is a good idea to consider using a mix of ads rather than spending all your resources on one platform.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you organize your marketing spending</h2>\r\n<p>Each practice has different marketing needs. Whether you are considering marketing spending for the first time, are building a brand, or need advice about how to prioritize and use your budget most efficiently, we can help. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Call us</a> to learn more and have your questions answered.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

When someone browses the web for a relevant practitioner, you not only want your company&#8217;s webpage to rank high on search results, but you also want that click to convert into an appointment. How do you build trust using your website? Discover a few ways regular blog posts may accomplish this, and more, for your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Blog posts build a connection</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb\">Forbes.com</a>, blog posts help establish a connection between readers and your practice. When your content is well written and provides accurate information in a relatable way, readers will respond. Creating informative posts bridges the gap between potential customers and your practice. Adding posts regularly builds your presence in the Google metrics and boosts your live site.</p>\r\n<h2>Successful blogs contain these elements</h2>\r\n<p>At DG, we know what it takes to boost your blog. By utilizing SEO-friendly techniques, our content develops an authoritative voice to elevate your practice in search results. Google uses the E-A-T system (Expertise, Authority, and Trust) to rank the trustworthiness of a brand or website. The more blogs that utilize certain measures, the higher the hits in this search metric. Delve into how these elements may yield new patients for your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<p>Every blog post should contain factual information. Citing outside sources via backlinks is one way to ensure the reader knows the claims made are accurate. Having verifiable sources that support the content in your blog is crucial to building the trust required to elevate your blog and business. If you are successful in establishing your authority, you may find other websites that link to your posts. When another webpage does this, it increases the visibility of your own through backlinking.</p>\r\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>SEO writing revolves around using keywords that search engines pick up when users enter them in the search box. Using keywords effectively in blog posts increases the likelihood of a company&#8217;s page showing up in results. Knowing the appropriate keywords to utilize when optimizing hits is an integral part of digital marketing.</p>\r\n<h3>Internal linking</h3>\r\n<p>When creating new material, you have the opportunity to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\">promote older posts</a>. Blogs remain intact on the practice&#8217;s page until deleted. If there is a shortage of ideas for new material, refresh older posts. Since the medical community is continually changing, you may update a previous post with new science. Instead of deleting the previous post, link it to the new. This is another effective way to increase views and trust for your business.</p>\r\n<h2>The time to capture business is now</h2>\r\n<p>Getting new patients should no longer depend only on referrals. Take control of your marketing through the creation of regular blog posts. Our team at Doctor Genius is standing by to answer your questions and get you started.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality.

According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
