However, dentists and medical professionals as a whole, need more than simple facts stated on a page. Starting out as a content writer, I strove to find the balance between providing well-researched academic information and speaking to a general audience. Writing for Doctor Genius has only improved my competence in authoring technical and patient-friendly medical content. In turn, my work and time with Doctor Genius have also enhanced our internal writing standards as I have become well-versed in what constitutes industry-best practices.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The three main areas I have learned to consider when writing for Doctor Genius are the sources or facts of the content itself, the SEO terminology, and creating comprehensible content in an easy-to-digest platform. My name is Nick Adams, and I am the Lead Editor at Doctor Genius, going on four years with the Company.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A Bit About Myself and the Content Team</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I started as a content writer at Doctor Genius in 2016, gradually working my way up to lead editor. Starting, I was the only in-house content writer. Now, as the lead editor, I mentor other writers and oversee our final product, creating greater quality control in every piece we produce. While I now focus more on editing and writing specialized content, my goal remains the same: improving our professionalism and readability standards, translating into improved client ranking, connecting more new patients to clients. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While the goal was the same, it was not easy to expand the styles and forms of content beyond what we had. After four years, I have been able to help the content department grow with the help of my manager, Alexander Hess. With his guidance, we continue to focus on quality over quantity while expanding our client’s ranking signals in authority and expertise through adding new digital assets.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One Step in the Overall Process</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Our writers’ editing process is more like a conversation, highlighting any corrections or changes to consider and sending it back to them for review. We strive to help our writers grow in their skills while also expanding their knowledge. Even after our writers complete the training, we encourage them to continue learning. When we assign a writer a custom content order, they will start researching the various keywords, the client’s medical specialty, and anything else they need to know.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even though the content department is only one part of the process, it is crucial to follow any instructions and strive for content that will help boost the client’s online presence. Once the writer finishes the content, I will review it and mark-up any changes they need to see before passing it back. After a final review, the content is ready to move on through to production for installation to the website.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- Start Author Panel -->\r\n<p>\r\n<style>\r\n    .author-panel {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-direction: row;\r\n        font-size: 1.0rem;\r\n        line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel.card {\r\n        padding: 2.5%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel p { line-height: 1.5 !important; }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel .panel-text {font-size: 14.5px !important; }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder {\r\n        width: 25%;\r\n        margin: 1% 2.5%\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder img, .author-info {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        max-width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder img {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        height: auto;\r\n        margin-bottom: 15px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info h5 {\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n        font-size: 100%;\r\n        text-decoration: underline\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info ul {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        padding-left: 0;\r\n        width: 100% !important;\r\n        justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel ul li {\r\n        list-style-type: none;\r\n        text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info li {\r\n        font-size: 75%;\r\n        font-style: italic;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .panel-text { width: 72.5%; margin-left: 2.5% }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel h5 { margin-bottom: 0)\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"author-panel card\">\r\n<div class=\"image-holder\"><img class=\"author-image alignnone wp-image-2430 size-thumbnail\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Adams - Lead Editor - Doctor Genius\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-480x480.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><br />\r\n<div class=\"author-info\">\r\n<h5>Nick Adams</h5>\r\n<!-- Uncomment these to utilize: --><!-- <ul><li><a title=\"Author page coming soon!\" disabled>Posts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\">Bio</a></li>-->\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"mailto:nadams@doctorgenius.com\">Email</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-text\">\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After graduating from Azusa Pacific University, with a BA in English-Writing Concentration, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-adams-27630344/\">Nick Adams</a> utilized his writing skills to build a professional career in writing. While at APU, Nick studied various forms and styles of writing, including journalism and technical writing. Before DG, Nick worked in other technical writing roles before shifting his focus on blogs and webpages associated with the medical field of addiction, mental health, and dual diagnosis treatment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2016, we brought Nick on as a Content Writer. Since then, Nick has written, edited, or overseen upwards of 300 separate custom content orders, written various forms of media text (blogs, video scripts, and press releases), and conducted quality control on written content. In total, he has worked on several thousand sites and clocked-in nearly a million words. His dedication, team spirit, and exceptional talent earned him a well-deserved promotion to Lead Editor last Winter. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Under the direction of the head of Content, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Alexander L Hess</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, MBA, Nick is poised to continue his professional-quality work with Doctor Genius. As he describes, “writing is a passion of mine, and I intend to take that passion into my everyday work. With my skills and experience, I plan to continue guiding our content department on our growth path and ensuring our clients receive the quality content they deserve.”</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Author Panel -->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Quality Content Over Quantity</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Creating quality content and helping oversee the creation of said content involves focusing on three main areas mentioned earlier: resources, SEO terminology, and comprehensible content.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Resources</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A major component of writing and editing content involves searching for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\">professional and credible resources</a>. Not only does this help our writers to learn better and understand the topic, but it also helps to flesh out the web pages for patients. The overall goal is to help patients learn and understand the specific service or treatment before scheduling an appointment. We focus on using .org websites, academic sources, and other information databases with this in mind.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SEO Terminology</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While the client has a list of keywords and terms relevant to their services, we strike a balance between SEO and comprehension. This way, the content is not weighed down with too many keywords to the point of being spam— this practice is often referred to as “keyword stuffing.” However, we still strive to use more technical or precise terms somewhere on a page to increase the chance of a patient searching that term online and finding our client’s website. This balance is struck by understanding <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-explains-the-difference-between-neural-matching-and-rankbrain/299713/\">neural matching</a>, which is writing content that will help a search engine present content that greatly matches a searcher&#8217;s intention. By working with our marketing team, we can determine the best course of action for each patient. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Comprehensible Content</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As an editor, I take the necessary time to read content for more than just errors. The content needs to be understandable for patients so that they are comfortable receiving medical services and are more likely to opt for the right treatment. At the same time, we strive to ensure it is factual and informative. This translates into clearly looking through every piece of content for its ability to reach the intended audience in a way that matches their specific needs. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to Start Getting High-Quality Content Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">By our content team continuing to grow, we will continue to offer more new digital assets that improve client ranking. The underline goal our team strives toward is providing the deepest breadth and width of content the medical practices have to offer.

But how? Taking a thorough and comprehensive analysis of industry standards, industry metrics, online presence, services offered, and the overall online strategy for your business can dramatically impact the direction your business will go.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Most recently, a study conducted by Local Med stated that, </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"padding: 0 2%;\">During quarantine, hygiene appointments weren&#8217;t happening. And that means those appointments weren&#8217;t being reappointed either. A deep dive into Dental Intelligence&#8217;s data has shown us that all across the country, hygiene chairs are less than 15% scheduled in September, October, and November.”</blockquote>\r\n<p>Just like any other area of your business, conducting a statistical analysis of your missed appointments, no shows, and gaps in scheduling are a great place to start in order to identify ways to improve and maximize the hygiene department`s productivity.</p>\r\n<h3>Why Did Appointments Dip in 2020?</h3>\r\n<p>Since March, medical <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/dont-avoid-your-doctor-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">visits have declined</a>, despite the impact doctors warn it could have on the nation’s health. Polling indicates that people are typically more fearful of going anywhere. A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/\">we looked at</a> the economic impact this is having on businesses and steps professionals can take to remain successful during a financial downturn. This is why the onus is on the dentist to schedule more appointments by reaching out to patients again.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2379\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg\" alt=\"Scheduled Hygiene Production\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-300x212.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-768x542.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-177x125.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\r\n<h3>How do we fix this?</h3>\r\n<p>By gaining more market share! We need to fill the gaps in your schedule by creating more awareness online that your practice is accepting new patients. We need to expand your online footprint and market your practice the <i>right</i> way!</p>\r\n<p>Dental Intelligence/Local Med adds that, “Normally, hygiene schedules are 80% full. But now they&#8217;re 80% empty. It&#8217;s vital to take steps now in order to be on track to see as many of your hygiene patients as possible.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>After auditing our own Doctor Genius client’s online and internal performance, we found that this was an overall trend for almost all dentists. It’s crucial to understand and correct this as soon as possible to ensure you’re maximizing each area of your dental practice in regard to consistency and improved performance over time. </p>\r\n<h3>We’re here to help!</h3>\r\n<p>Since dentists are experiencing fluctuations in scheduling hygiene appointments during the quarantine, even with rescheduling efforts, there will still be a gap of incoming patients equivalent to that gap. However, clients of Doctor Genius have an online presence and system in place to continue scheduling appointments, rescheduling appointments, and focusing on patient retention efforts.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can identify areas of opportunity to benefit a client’s practice, boost their online presence, and help increase practice sustainability during these uncertain times. With COVID-19 continuing to alter the medical landscape in numerous ways, it is crucial to have a plan that can adapt to this climate. Our team will help clients learn how to utilize their online reach to continue seeing current patients while bringing in new patients.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the process, Doctor Genius can help you know where you are, understand your gap analysis, and develop a plan for how to proceed.

But when you step<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When your practice struggles financially, the initial urge might be to reduce costs, including marketing expenditures. But when you step back and view your practice more objectively within the broader economic conditions, you might recognize the need for a more thoughtful strategy and a different approach. Historical trends provide lessons to medical practices seeking ways to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on their bottom line. Winners happened to be those businesses and practices that went against the current, either maintain marketing expenditures or increasing them. Therefore, your medical practice&#8217;s key to successfully emerging from the recession is continued investments in marketing and, more significantly today, digital marketing.</p>\r\n<h2>Cyclical Nature of the Economy</h2>\r\n<p>Over time, a country&#8217;s economic activity experiences periods of expansion and contraction. Determining which stage an economy is in requires analysis of the gross domestic product (GDP), national rates of employment, level of retail sales, and amount of personal income. Business cycles progress through a set pattern, but the length of each phase in this pattern varies. These cycles are demarcated by periods of economic expansion and contraction: also referred to as peaks and troughs, respectively. Historically, U.S. business cycles average about six years.</p>\r\n<p>Closely tracking the trends in cycles reveals that there are six stages an economy goes through.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Expansion</em></h3>\r\n<p>During the expansion period, employment levels, business profits, wages, and overall demand and supply are high. The money supply moves continuously and uninterrupted. Consumer confidence is high, and so is spending.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Peak</em></h3>\r\n<p>At some point, the economy reaches its maximum growth level, known as the peak.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Recession</em></h3>\r\n<p>At the end of the peak, a recession begins, and economic activity shrinks. Recessions typically experience high unemployment, negative economic growth, fewer sales as consumer demand declines, stagnation or drop in income, and less production output.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Depression</em></h3>\r\n<p>Depression furthers the declines of recession, with significant decreases in employment, investment, production, and consumer confidence.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Trough</em></h3>\r\n<p>The trough represents the lowest point in the economy.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Recovery</em></h3>\r\n<p>The recovery phase begins the improvement in the economy, as economic activity begins to increase. Low prices contribute to increased levels of demand, and production and employment levels start to rise. Investment, confidence, and spending also start to increase. This is the final stage of a complete business cycle.</p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The economy predictably experiences ups and downs as it progresses through multiple stages: expansion, peak, recession, depression, trough, and recovery.</li>\r\n\t<li>These stages make a complete business cycle.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Signs of Economic Recession</h2>\r\n<p>In the United States, the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/cycles/june2020.html\">National Bureau of Economic Research</a> (NBER) maintains a chronology of business cycles. The NBER tracks various indicators every month to determine the economy&#8217;s point in the business cycle. According to the NBER, the United States entered the beginning of a recession in March 2020, based on the significant decline in economic activity throughout the economy, including record-level unemployment and a sharp drop in industrial production.</p>\r\n<p>The peak in the U.S. economy&#8217;s monthly economic activity occurred in February, marking the end of a 128-month period that was the longest expansion in the history of U.S. business cycles.</p>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 public health emergency inspired a decline in employment and production of unprecedented magnitude that reaches across the entire economy. This recession has different dynamics than prior recessions, due to the pandemic, and might last for a briefer time. But the disease&#8217;s progression, governmental responses to the pandemic, and individual behaviors cannot be known with any certainty. What is known is that the expansion stage is an economy&#8217;s normal state, with most recessions brief, lasting from six months to a year or two.</p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The United States entered a recession, fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Marketing Spending During a Recession</h2>\r\n<p>When a recession begins, overall spending tends to shrink. Businesses&#8217; finances start to suffer. Thus, to balance less revenue, the budgets begin to allocate less spending. Perks and plans for expansion are among the first areas that a company cuts, along with marketing. <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/what-marketers-and-agencies-might-expect-if-recession-happens/2195251\">Ad spending dropped</a> about 12% in 2009, the last year of the most recent recession. Some experts estimate that <a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/mark-ritson-marketing-spend-recession-coronavirus/\">ad spend likely will shrink by 30 to 60</a>% through 2020. A survey of marketers found that <a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/marketing-campaigns-delays-rise-coronavirus/\">90% either are delaying or revising their marketing budgets</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Most business managers tend to believe that spending funds on marketing efforts during a time when customers are spending less just cuts into profits. In the short term, this could be accurate. Reducing marketing spending in a recession might protect immediate profits, but only briefly. But neglecting marketing during an economic downturn results in a weakened brand and fewer profits post-recession.</p>\r\n<p>Savvy business owners realize that marketing expenditures have the potential to contribute to profits in the longer term. The evidence clearly and consistently shows that it pays to maintain or even increase investments in marketing during an economic downturn. The rationale is that while others reduce their spending on marketing, there is a greater opportunity to have a share of voice when competitors go silent. Expert marketing consultants often teach their clients to actually increase advertising spending during recessions to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2019/09/05/when-a-recession-comes-dont-stop-advertising/#3675901a4608\">take advantage of the lower cost.</a> </p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Most businesses reduce marketing spending during economic downturns, though continuing or increasing marketing would be better for the long term.</li>\r\n\t<li>Increasing spending can help increase awareness and take advantage of cheaper marketing costs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Counter-Cyclical Strategy for Advertising and Marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Most people and businesses follow a pro-cyclical approach to spending and investment. Their behaviors correspond with the stage of the business cycle. For example, when there is economic expansion and prosperity, many individuals and companies will engage in behavior that falls in line with that growth and serves to extend the period. Consumers buy more things, and companies invest more in areas like marketing. During an economic recession, the majority pro-cyclically cut their spending and reduce their investments.</p>\r\n<p>A counter-cyclical strategy does not cut spending during times of economic contraction, and businesses that use a counter-cyclical strategy are more likely to survive. (At Doctor Genius, we follow a counter-cyclical strategy.) A century of research supports this approach. For example, a <a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/when-the-going-gets-tough-the-tough-dont-skimp-on-their-ad-budgets/\">McGraw-Hill Research study</a> examined 600 companies from 1980 to 1985. The businesses that maintained or increased their level of advertising expenditures during the recession experienced significantly higher sales when the economy recovered than companies that decreased ad spending. Specifically, aggressive advertisers during the recession had sales 256% higher than the companies that chose not to advertise.</p>\r\n<p>A few examples follow.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Kellogg&#8217;s triumph over Post</em></h3>\r\n<p>Post entered the Great Depression as the category leader in the <a href=\"https://spinsucks.com/communication/what-kelloggs-and-the-great-depression-can-teach-you-about-pr-and-marketing/\">ready-to-eat cereal market</a>. During the depression, Post significantly cut its advertising budget while Kellogg&#8217;s followed a counter-cyclical approach, doubling its advertising spend. Kellogg&#8217;s heavily invested in radio advertisements and introduced a new cereal, Rice Krispies. Kellogg&#8217;s overtook Post as the category leader, growing its profits by 30%.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Toyota&#8217;s rise to the top imported carmaker</em></h3>\r\n<p>The energy crisis triggered a 17-month recession from 1973-75. Toyota&#8217;s sales of its fuel-efficient cars were strong, but the company resisted the temptation to reduce its ad budget when the economic downturn came. By 1976, <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/news/ten-things-learn-70s-recession/131670\">Toyota surpassed all competitors</a> to become the top imported carmaker in the United States.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Target&#8217;s recession success</em></h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2010/03/roaring-out-of-recession\">Harvard Business Review</a> analyzed the strategies and corporate performance of thousands of companies during three global recessions, finding only about 9% flourished after a slowdown in terms of sales and profits growth. These companies balanced cutting costs to survive the recession and investing for the post-recession. The companies most successful after the recession focused more on operational efficiency improvements and spent more on marketing, research and development, and new assets.</p>\r\n<p>One example of a company that successfully balanced short-term needs with long-term planning is Target. Target responded to the 2000 recession with a reduction in its operating costs, narrowing distribution margins, and a 20% increase in its sales and marketing budget. The company&#8217;s sales grew by 40% over the course of the recession, and its profit margin increased to 10% in the three years after the recession.</p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A counter-cyclical strategy does not cut spending during a recession.</li>\r\n\t<li>Research from several recessions in U.S. history demonstrates that companies following a counter-cyclical approach to marketing are more likely to succeed than competitors who cut advertising spending.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Why a Counter-Cyclical Marketing Strategy Works</h2>\r\n<p>A counter-cyclical approach that increases marketing spending during a downturn makes sense and is effective for several reasons.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Gain market voice and market share</em></h3>\r\n<p>A recession provides opportunities to gain market share and market leadership. Businesses that maintain their marketing budget while competitors cut theirs automatically increase their share of voice. Share of voice leads to gaining market share and long-term benefits. Additionally, your message is more likely to be heard when fewer competitors advertise. You can <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">amplify your online presence</a> and market voice through several means, which Doctor Genius can help you utilize.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Keep brand current in consumer minds.</em></h3>\r\n<p>Maintaining or increasing marketing efforts keeps your company in the forethought of consumers. When purchase decisions are made, a customer is more likely to choose your brand, since it is more easily remembered in consumer minds.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Retain brand loyalty.</em></h3>\r\n<p>The primary source of cash flow and practice growth is a loyal customer base. Developing and then maintaining a strong brand, one that patients recognize and trust, is one of the best ways to minimize business risk. Continued marketing outreach even during an economic downturn works to keep loyal customers.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Convey confidence and stability.</em></h3>\r\n<p>When consumers observe a company that continues to advertise during a down economy, the impression usually made is of a stable and confident company. Business decision-makers feel more positive about that company&#8217;s commitment to its products and services. </p>\r\n<h3><em>Increase relative spending.</em></h3>\r\n<p>During a recession, the cost of advertising space falls, the battle to appear in search results becomes less aggressive, and fewer companies invest in a good SEO content strategy. Even if your marketing spending remains the same, your relative spending will increase. You will get more advertising distribution, with less competition. A recession is a good time to invest in marketing because you get more for your money.</p>\r\n<p>A cyclical approach, in which the business cuts marketing costs in economic recessions, damages the business&#8217;s long-term chances for success. Not advertising decreases brand awareness, lowers search result rankings, and diminishes brand loyalty. These are very expensive to regain once lost, especially once the economy recovers and competition again increases.</p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Counter-cyclical marketing investment brings a greater share of voice and market share, builds brand recognition and loyalty, conveys confidence, and increases the amount of relative spending.</li>\r\n\t<li>Cyclical marketing weakens a company&#8217;s market position and makes regaining that position after the recession more challenging and more expensive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Marketing Steps to Take During a Recession</h2>\r\n<p>Spending alone does not bring benefits. Rather, the spending must be strategic. Benefits come to the practices that are responsive to the market fluctuations and changes in their patients&#8217; circumstances and behaviors.</p>\r\n<p>During the COVID-19 crisis, patients&#8217; daily activities have changed, and so too must medical practices. Small offices&#8217; marketing strategies must adapt to changes in circumstances and behaviors. For example, as the majority of Americans sheltered in place with limited physical interactions, the reliance on virtual networks grew. More and more people are spending greater amounts of time in front of a screen. Conventional marketing tactics will not work in unconventional times. To reach your patients, you need to go where they are spending much of their time: online.</p>\r\n<p>Help your patients find you online by following some <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">fundamentals of digital marketing</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Focus on gaining social media presence and engagement.</li>\r\n\t<li>Create videos useful to your patients and potential patients.</li>\r\n\t<li>Improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of your website and blog.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Adjust your SEO strategies. To more easily be found during online searches, your practice requires good SEO practices that are up-to-date to reflect not only Google&#8217;s<a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\"> changes in its ranking algorithms</a> but your patients&#8217; and potential patients&#8217; shifting needs.</p>\r\n<p>During a recession, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2009/04/how-to-market-in-a-downturn-2\">consumer spending and priorities shift</a>. You need to recognize the changes in your patients&#8217; interests and intentions, and you must adjust your marketing strategies and messaging. The pandemic behind the recession further complicates efforts, adding an additional layer of concerns and considerations.</p>\r\n<p>One should also increase the frequency of posts and the range of content published. As Nielson reports, <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/covid-19-tracking-the-impact-on-media-consumption/\">time online has increased by 215%</a>. This is true despite a reported decrease in online marketing by traditional retails. In other words, this means that there is an opportunity to increase one&#8217;s share of voice during this downturn that has the capacity to reap demonstrable growth. As we&#8217;ve reported on during previous blogs, our clients have seen record highs in views. Clients at our higher tiers have seen this effect amplified as they post content more frequently and in a wider breadth of formats. </p>\r\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Having a marketing plan that bolsters the frequency and category of content during this time can improve ranking substantially during the COVID recession.</li>\r\n\t<li>Your marketing budget should remain the same or increase during the recession.</li>\r\n\t<li>Your practice needs digital marketing, including social media and website with an SEO focus.</li>\r\n\t<li>Understand how patients&#8217; priorities have shifted and adjust marketing accordingly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is the digital marketing and software company that can help medical and dental practices get an edge over competitors.

To achieve this, we can help review every aspect of your practice and find the key areas for improvement.</p>\r\n<p>The next question many people are asking is, &#8220;how to transition into a complete health practice?&#8221; This is where the relaunch program helps.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the Relaunch Program?</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram\">The Relaunch Program</a> is a one-month step-by-step coaching program with one of our NextLevel expert coaches. The coach will work with the client, providing a concrete written plan. This plan will help inspire your team to provide:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Outstanding patient care</li>\r\n\t<li>Increase productivity</li>\r\n\t<li>Optimize profitability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This program helps promote <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/relaunch-program-part-1-complete-health-practice-with-gary-kadi-and-doctor-genius/\">complete health dentistry,</a> which involves an entirely new approach to dental care. Instead of only viewing a patient&#8217;s oral health, dentists consider how one&#8217;s oral health affects the rest of the body before customizing a new treatment for a healthier lifestyle. This program features three one-hour sessions with your very own coach, who will work with you one-on-one. This will allow your advisor to build a strong report, as they continue to provide solutions uniquely tailored to your brand. </p>\r\n<h2>How Many Sessions are in the Relaunch Program?</h2>\r\n<p>The Relaunch program is in three main sessions, Launchpad, Trajectory, and Launch Plan. Each session&#8217;s goal is to help lay the foundation for your unique relaunch plan and map out the process step by step.</p>\r\n<h3>Session 1: Launchpad</h3>\r\n<p>During the first session, the coach will help define your goals for your practice and career. After all, the only way to truly enhance your practice is to flesh out your ideal vision. This session is the first step to relaunching your practice in a new direction.</p>\r\n<h3>Session 2: Trajectory</h3>\r\n<p>During the second session, the coach will go over your practice&#8217;s history, available services, profitability, and more. This session&#8217;s goal is to take a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of the practice and create a clear picture of the areas of opportunity for growth. The coach can also help find the areas that will need the most change, helping you boost the efficiency of your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Session 3: Launch Plan</h3>\r\n<p>The last session involves developing a clear plan for your practice from where it is now, to where you want it to be. While the steps remain the same, each plan is customized to the individual client&#8217;s practice. Thus, you will be able to develop the ideas for your practice and achieve substantial results. We will help guide your practice in the direction it needs to go while working within the plan.</p>\r\n<h2>Take Your Practice to the Next Level</h2>\r\n<p>Under the direction of Gary Kadi, NextLevel Practice offers multiple options that include the Relaunch Program.

Due to the new situation for many patients in your community, it is crucial to learn how to tap into that market and offer the healthy lifestyle your services can provide. Doctor Genius has partnered with Gary Kadi, CEO of NextLevel Practice, to help clients like yourself face uncertainty while reopening your practice with a focus to adjust for success.</p>\n<h4>Who is Gary Kadi?</h4>\n<p>CEO of NextLevel Practice, Gary Kadi is also an advocate, author, and documentarian. Kadi authored Million Dollar Dentistry, a book that promotes dentists building a healthy practice for healthy patients and healthy lives. Kadi has guided NextLevel Practice to create over 1.6 billion in increased collections, 50,000 more true vacation weeks, and over 6 million healthier patients with practices. Kadi strives to help dentists educate their patients, empower their teams, and improve their finances.</p>\n<h4>What is a Complete Health Practice?</h4>\n<p>Complete Health Dentistry is a philosophy that focuses on maintaining good oral health in order to improve your overall general health. When you see your Complete Health Dentist for one of your preventive dental checkups, you’re not only taking care of your mouth but also your body. They will not only clean your teeth but also check for the early warning signs of both periodontal disease, oral cancer, and more. You’d be surprised what your mouth can tell you about the health of your entire body!</p>\n<p>With this in mind, a practice that believes in and practices Complete Health Dentistry integrates all areas of dental medicine in order to bring harmony to the mouth and body. Complete Health Dentistry Services Include: </p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A clean and attractive smile</li>\n\t<li>Cavity detection and treatment</li>\n\t<li>Gum disease therapy to stop the spread of this bacterial infection</li>\n\t<li>Oral cancer screening</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How is Complete Health Dentistry Becoming the New Normal?</h4>\n<p>As Gary Kadi explains, there are four main areas of the new normal in dentistry, including:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Less time for traditional dentistry methods</li>\n\t<li>Increased expenses</li>\n\t<li>Patient scarcity</li>\n\t<li>A new focus on selling health on a website</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What is the purpose of the Complete Health Practice Plan?</h4>\n<p>The purpose of the Complete Health Practice Plan is to provide our clients with the framework for a thriving practice in a new world. Our framework is an extension to Gary Kadi’s NextLevel Practice coaching products and programs, who work to create a “Healthy Practice” to make patients healthier. The Practice Plan’s end goal is to improve the health of the patient, team, and practice by conveying the connection between oral health and overall health. The Complete Health Practice brings to light the areas of the body and conditions most prominently related to untreated oral health.</p>\n<p>This process involves reviewing the patient’s medical history for signs of issues such as diabetes, inflammation, or high blood pressure that can correlate to the treatment and prevention of oral health issues. The patient’s experience from the initial call to the discussion of treatment plans will be focused on their overall health through achieving a healthy mouth. </p>\n<p>The content and messaging of a dentist’s website are valuable because you are educating patients about the practice, what the goal of the practice is, and the reason the patient needs it. Our clients can help build a positive relationship with patients for regular checkups in the future. We will ensure that patients receive your message about Complete Health Dentistry through your website and online marketing.</p>\n<h2>Selling Health Through Educating Content</h2>\n<p>Patients are becoming better informed about dental care as our culture continues to increase its emphasis on the importance of a healthy lifestyle. With educating content, dentists can help patients understand the importance of proper dental care and how to receive it.</p>\n<h4>How can educating content help increase the flow of patients?</h4>\n<p>Our premium plans feature additional services that allow for customized content such as website copy, dental service pages, blogs, etc. We can develop content that sends the right message for what your practice is all about, combining SEO value to help increase your rankings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">Click here to learn more about educating content and how it can help you.</a></p>\n<h4>How can you help my website rank?</h4>\n<p>While helping a website to remain active, Doctor Genius continues to monitor and stay up to date on <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">Google’s algorithm updates</a>. When Google changes the way their search algorithm operates, there is a chance that a website’s position on a search results list will fluctuate. Even though this can work in favor of certain fields (medical, entertainment, news, etc.), other websites can face lower ranking. Many feel the effects of a core update may seemingly be unpredictable. However, our team tracks industry experts and corporate publications to follow the breadcrumbs that reveal where Google will likely shift focus on what content ranking is more important. </p>\n<h2>Reach Out to Us and Re-Invent Your Practice for Success</h2>\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about the Complete Health Practice and how Gary Kadi can help you formulate a plan of action visit, <a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram\">https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram</a>.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge.
