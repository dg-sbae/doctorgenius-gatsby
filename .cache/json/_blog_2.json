There are many areas this type of lawyer can help with in addition to litigation, and having a trusted lawyer before you need one can eliminate the stress associated with having to scramble to locate one on short notice.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to find a trusted professional dental lawyer</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to confidential matters and issues that could have a tremendous impact on your practice, the <a href=\"https://ebusiness.ada.org/assets/docs/6850.PDF?OrderID=2104406\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://ebusiness.ada.org/assets/docs/6850.PDF?OrderID=2104406\">American Dental Association</a> recommends choosing your lawyer carefully. Here are methods to use when deciding on a lawyer for your dental practice. </p>\r\n<h3>Consult online resources</h3>\r\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of using a search engine like Google as you begin your query is the ability to see reviews from previous clients. Although some opinions may be a bit extreme, reviews can typically provide a general overview of how professional and successful a lawyer has been in the past. </p>\r\n<h3>Take advantage of your network</h3>\r\n<p>Odds are good you know someone at another practice who has used a dental lawyer before, a friend or relative who is a lawyer in this area, or experience with dental law. Be bold about asking peers for a referral. People are not likely to recommend someone to you unless they know that person will do a good job. </p>\r\n<h3>Use a lawyer referral service</h3>\r\n<p>Many state and local bar associations often have a lawyer referral service. The lawyers these services refer people to are generally well known and respected in their communities and have a proven track record of success. If this is the route you choose to go, it is more about picking the lawyer who is the right fit for your practice than having to decide whether the lawyer is competent. </p>\r\n<h3>Ask your malpractice carrier</h3>\r\n<p>Because all operating medical practices should have a malpractice carrier, this option is relatively simple. You should already have a representative and a phone number or email address handy. Contact your malpractice representative and ask about respected lawyers who have handled cases similar to yours. </p>\r\n<h3>Talk to your state dental association</h3>\r\n<p>Some state dental associations have approved referral lists of law firms and attorneys. Because these lists typically include lawyers from all over the state, it is important to be aware of the location of the lawyers you are most interested in. If you need legal advice in a specialized area, make sure to ask what kind of experience the lawyer has in that area specifically. </p>\r\n<h2>Turn to us for help</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you need a dental lawyer, assistance with <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-faqs-on-web-pages/\">medical marketing</a>, or ideas on how to improve patient retention, Doctor Genius has you covered.

Knowing exactly<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/understanding-your-brand/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When it comes to having a successful marketing strategy, understanding your medical practice brand is a critical component. Knowing exactly who you are and what you are about as a practice can be a key element to creating and communicating a strong brand presence and increasing your appeal to potential patients. </p>\r\n<h2>Know what makes your practice unique</h2>\r\n<p>There is a reason why you decided to run your own practice. Considering this can help you better understand what defines your brand. The &#8220;why&#8221; behind your process can make your practice more appealing to patients. </p>\r\n<h3>Identify your personality</h3>\r\n<p>Figuring out your personality and company culture as a practice can make it more relatable to your target patients. Do you have an older staff, play soft music, and keep many plants around the office? This personality could be more suited to senior generations. Decisions about office staff and ambiance should not be arbitrary but part of your strategy to communicate your brand and gain patient loyalty. </p>\r\n<h3>Define your voice</h3>\r\n<p>Every practice has a brand voice, whether it is intentionally or unintentionally conveyed. Everything from the demeanor of your staff to the language used on your website sets the tone for your patients&#8217; experience. Is your voice encouraging and empowering? Informative and friendly? Professional and ambitious? Knowing how you want to be perceived by your patients can help you determine which voice to use and be purposeful in expressing it.</p>\r\n<h3>Create a visual identity</h3>\r\n<p>In conjunction with language, the way your office and website look can have a tremendous impact on your brand. Do they have a modern, edgy appearance or a classic, comfortable feel? Everything from the color of the paint and the pictures on the walls to the layout of your webpage communicates the brand of your practice. Tailoring the design of your office and website to appeal to your target patients can help entice them to visit your office as well as make them feel comfortable while there.</p>\r\n<h2>Understand the benefits of branding for patients</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/07/why-is-it-important-to-brand-your-business/#57e7cee56c15\">Forbes</a>, the right branding can help you make a lasting first impression that can both attract new clients and impress the ones you have. When you clearly communicate the type of practice you run and what makes it special, it takes that guesswork out of the equation for patients and can put them at ease about visiting your office for the first time. The more comfortable patients feel about their visit, the more likely they are to have a positive experience and become loyal patients for life. </p>\r\n<h2>Reach target patients more effectively</h2>\r\n<p>The Doctor Genius team knows gaining and retaining patients is the lifeblood of your practice. We can help you identify and clearly communicate your brand so your marketing is more effective and you can spend more time caring for your patients than you do trying to get new ones.

To effectively strengthen your medical practice’s credibility and expertise in your field, focus your efforts on improving your site’s SEO and developing your brand both online and in the real world.</p>\r\n<h2>How to increase authority online</h2>\r\n<p>When talking about a company’s authority, it helps to think of this term as having a two-fold meaning. In one sense, the word “authority” indicates whether a medical practice is seen as a leader in its field that consumers can readily trust and rely on due to significant expertise and experience. However, in the world of digital marketing, companies are also concerned with website authority, which is closely connected with the site’s SEO.</p>\r\n<h3>SEO and website authority</h3>\r\n<p>One of the main factors search engines consider when producing the search engine results pages for a specific keyword or topic is how trustworthy and well-regarded each website is. The more credible and popular the site, the more likely it is to rank high on the SERP. While there is some level of obscurity even among experts on every feature search engines consider when determining these rankings, there are several factors every company should consider when first creating or enhancing a website:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Quality Content: </strong>While a polished website that neatly lists your practice’s services and contact location is a good start, creating high-quality, relevant content through <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly\">blog posts</a> and other information content can help guide qualified leads to your site and increase your overall authority for SEO.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Backlinks: </strong>Using backlinks to other websites in your content and in turn being linked to on others’ websites are another important way to boost authority. When link building, carefully monitor which sites link to your content. Sites that have low authority can actually hurt your website’s SEO and should be <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en\">disavowed</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reviews: </strong>Having a large number of positive reviews, especially those with well-crafted descriptions, can have a positive effect on potential patients and boost your SEO. For Google, make sure your <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\">Google My Business</a> account is fully set up, and take time to review and respond to any reviews that are left.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How to increase real-world authority</h2>\r\n<p>While an authority medical site is more likely to rank higher on search engines, your practice’s authority extends beyond online presence. Make sure your business is well-branded and as clean and polished in person as it looks on your website. Strive to be a leader in your field, seeking opportunities to be innovative and to offer niche services that set you apart from the competition. Maintain open lines of communication and stay active on social media, taking care to address any questions and concerns from current and potential patients. Use opportunities as they present themselves to establish your expertise in your field of study, whether that means publishing content, creating instructional videos, or taking part in presentations.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn how digital marketing can help you increase authority</h2>\r\n<p>A quality website and strong digital marketing strategy are essential components of an authority medical site.

This<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/what-is-an-engagement-committee/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The purpose of an engagement committee is to create a direct line of communication between you and your employees. This group of representatives will allow more insight from your team about what they think about the company&#8217;s culture. Implementing an engagement committee can help take the guesswork out of employee satisfaction and provide valuable information about improving your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Improving Employee Satisfaction and Productivity</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/06/22/employee-engagement-what-and-why/?sh=2bb31807f372\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/06/22/employee-engagement-what-and-why/?sh=2bb31807f372\">Forbes </a>defines employee engagement as the emotional commitment an employee has to an organization and its goals. Establishing this group can be an excellent way to improve communication between leadership and the rest of the staff while increasing the commitment employees have to their workplace. Engagement committees help promote a healthy working environment by facilitating networking and exchanging ideas to improve employee satisfaction and productivity.</p>\r\n<h3>Giving Everyone a Voice</h3>\r\n<p>Most practices have employees who do excellent work behind the scenes but are not necessarily involved in decision-making processes. It can be easy for ideas from this demographic to go unheard. These employees are important because they are often the ones that can point out better processes, improve patient relations, or cut costs. Voicing opinions also allows employees to build intrinsic motivators and create a sense of trust and belonging. Engagement committees give these employees a way to suggest ideas and help make the business better.</p>\r\n<h3>Understanding Employees</h3>\r\n<p>Perhaps employees feel uncomfortable approaching the leadership with questions or concerns. Or they may be concerned about maintaining an appropriate work-life balance. While it is possible to get some insight from employee surveys, an engagement committee can provide more context and understanding to the way employees feel and think. Knowing the reasons behind such employee sentiment is also essential to creating any positive change within the workplace.</p>\r\n<h3>Address Employee Concerns</h3>\r\n<p>In many cases, employees leave a job without providing the real reason they were unhappy. Having an engagement committee can reveal the source of the problem and allow the company to address it quickly. Taking action can prevent the employee from leaving and help prevent other employees from quitting for the same reason. </p>\r\n<h3>Bring Unknown Issues to Light</h3>\r\n<p>Lower-level employees frequently have concerns that go unvoiced. When these concerns go unaddressed, operations are less productive than they could be, and employee morale is lower than it should be. Having an engagement committee can help solve such issues efficiently and keep employees feeling <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-new-normal-how-to-keep-your-teams-engaged-and-motivated/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-new-normal-how-to-keep-your-teams-engaged-and-motivated/\">connected and motivated</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>We Can Help</h2>\r\n<p>Engagement is important for every practice, whether it is from patients or your employees.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most. Digital marketing can help your practice adapt and grow in the aftermath of COVID-19.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Are Here to Help </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unsure if your dental practice is ready for the digital landscape, we can help.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
