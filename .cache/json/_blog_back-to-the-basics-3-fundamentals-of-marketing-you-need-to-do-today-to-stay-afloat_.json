The global pandemic continues to claim more lives as each day passes, and it has disrupted manufacturing and businesses in ways we have never seen before. Many businesses have been slowed down to a halt, while others have to reduce their hours of operation.</p>\r\n<p>Without a doubt, this pandemic will bring significant changes to our lives, as it proves how unprepared the world is for such events. COVID-19 brings the apocalypse for many businesses, but others will be able to use the disruption to their advantage.</p>\r\n<h2>Marketing in a world with COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Figuring out the right ways to market a business might seem like rocket science. Still, the fundamentals of digital marketing can help your business make it through the current economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. Here are simple things you can do to ensure that people can find your business online:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Social media marketing</h3>\r\n<p>Social media is where billions of people all over the globe connect on online platforms. Social media marketing might seem intimidating if it is not something you use personally, but many of these platforms are easy to figure out. If you are one of those people who have a hard time navigating the internet, take online classes to familiarize yourself with the social media platform you plan to use or hire a social media manager.</p>\r\n<p>Think of social media as a place you can share your thoughts, products, and services. Consistently post information that provides value, and your following will grow. A huge following allows you to send information about your business to a large number of people in a matter of seconds. You can also use direct messages to market products and services or network with other business owners who might have helpful information.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Create videos</h3>\r\n<p>Video marketing is another great way to market your business. Business owners can do this by making video tutorials targeting keywords relevant to their business. For example, a dentist who runs their practice can create step-by-step tutorials on the proper way to floss. People looking to improve their flossing technique enter keywords into a search engine. The tutorial created by the dentist pops up, and the patient gets the information they need from a credible source. YouTube is a great place to start with marketing videos.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Create a blog with a focus on search engine optimization</h3>\r\n<p>A web-blog also helps you reach a wider audience. Many business owners are hesitant to start one because they feel that the many other pages online will drown theirs out, but that only happens when you do not include search engine optimization as part of your marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<p>A good SEO strategy allows you to drive organic traffic to your blog. There are no limits to how much traffic a business can bring in using SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>The fundamentals will get you past COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Stick to the fundaments of digital marketing, and your business will be more likely to survive the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus.

Washing your<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/positively-impact-your-practice-with-these-simple-steps/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The COVID-19 global pandemic will impact your business even if you do not buy into the media frenzy. Washing your hands might help you keep the virus away, but it will not bring more customers to your business.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping your business moving forward during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>This article will go over tactics you can use to keep your business above water as you navigate around the uncertainty created by the coronavirus. Here are simple ways to positively impact your business and customers.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Use automated lead processes</h3>\r\n<p>Business owners should already have automated lead generation systems in place. If your business does not already have one, now is a good time to start. Such systems can easily help you double your sales and bring in extra revenue that might help keep the doors of your business open.</p>\r\n<p>Businesses without automated ways to generate leads are essentially running up a hill. They often end up spending more money to generate fewer leads. Automating the process allows business owners to sell their products and services even when the business is closed.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Streamline systems and use fewer workers</h3>\r\n<p>It is typically easier to manage a system than it is to manage individuals. People tend to become more unreliable during stressful times, and having a system in place makes it easier to determine which employees are contributing the most. It also allows them to work more efficiently.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Provide safeguards for customers</h3>\r\n<p>With so much uncertainty going around, providing safeguards for customers will make them more likely to purchase your business&#8217;s products and services. Let customers know how your business is adapting to the coronavirus and what will happen if you are not able to fulfill your end of the contract due to the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Understanding how potential customers have been affected by the coronavirus can also help increase your sales. For example, providing payment plans can be helpful when dealing with customers whose income has been limited by COVID-19. Surveys are a great way to get into the minds of potential customers and understand their concerns. The business can then implement safeguards that address these concerns.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Use high-quality copy</h3>\r\n<p>People being quarantined due to the coronavirus means that they are spending more time online. Having a website or web marketing system gives business owners a huge competitive advantage right now.</p>\r\n<p>Marketing tactics like search engine optimization will bring traffic to a business, but that is only half the battle. Engaging copy on your website is what builds trust with the person and prompts them to make a purchase. It involves placing relevant content at the top of the page.</p>\r\n<p>Focusing on the quantity of content on a website over quality rarely ever works out for the business. People will not trust your business if you have poorly written content on your site, and you will not generate much revenue with weak sales pitches.</p>\r\n<h2>Take advantage of new opportunities</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 brings its share of challenges, but it also brings many opportunities that smart business owners can take advantage of for their benefit. Contact Doctor Genius to learn more about how your business can survive the coronavirus by increasing your focus on internet marketing.</p>\r\n<p><em>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

You understand the importance of social<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-do-i-reschedule-all-my-appointments/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>You know that you should postpone elective and preventive care during the COVID-19 crisis. You understand the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve. Still, you worry about finances. You need a full schedule to generate revenue, so rescheduling your appointments is critical. Here are a few rescheduling tips to help your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Tips for rescheduling appointments during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Communication is key to filling waiting rooms once the crisis is over. Health care providers know that shelter-in-place orders could continue for months. Some even expect it could last until 2021 when a possible vaccine may finally be ready. Providers should connect with patients, so they understand what to expect during this time.</p>\r\n<p>Also, this call will help ensure patients return for the rescheduled appointment. The provider can answer any questions patients may have.</p>\r\n<h3>Prioritize based on the needs of the patients</h3>\r\n<p>Health care providers should prioritize patients when rescheduling appointments. Patients who are at the highest risk should get priority when rescheduling. Providers should stay in frequent contact with these patients, providing updates on when it will be possible to see them again. Maintaining contact shows the patients that their health is a priority for the practice. This provides an incentive to reschedule.</p>\r\n<h3>Make rescheduling easy</h3>\r\n<p>Even before COVID-19, most patients prefer scheduling appointments online. Practices can expect to see a spike in rescheduled appointments with online scheduling. The fear of the unknown makes it difficult for patients to know when it is okay to go to a provider. By providing online scheduling, patients can fill those slots when they feel comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>This also lessens the burden on the staff. Staff members are already bogged down with phone calls. Allowing patients to reschedule online allows members to talk to those who need it most. This takes the stress off the staff members’ shoulders. It also makes it easier to keep a full schedule. Patients, employees, and business owners win with this strategy.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider telehealth</h3>\r\n<p>Telehealth and teledentistry have come into vogue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology allows providers to manage basic conditions and offer preventative care. These appointments tend to take less time for both the patient and the provider and are more affordable. They can also take place over the computer or phone. This form of appointment limits in-person visits.</p>\r\n<p>If possible, providers should rely on telehealth to manage some of the burdens. Filling the schedule with telehealth appointments makes it easier to meet the demands of the patients. Providers who use this can begin seeing patients now. These providers do not have to wait until the crisis is over. Also, providers can maintain appointments with telehealth even after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep the books full during and after the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>It is normal to feel worried about the state of your practice during a pandemic. Canceled appointments hurt your bottom line. You need to reschedule those missed opportunities. Fortunately, you can fill your schedule. Communicate with your patients, give priority to those who are at the highest risk, and make it easy for people to reschedule. Also, you can rely on telehealth so you can catch up on rescheduled appointments quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
