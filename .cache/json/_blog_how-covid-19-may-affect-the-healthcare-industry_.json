Not only have traders seen the effects of the virus, but<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-covid-19-may-affect-the-healthcare-industry/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to greatly impact the global economy. Not only have traders seen the effects of the virus, but now the overall U.S. economy is seeing them too. On Monday, all three major stock indexes fell at least 12%, and The Federal Reserve cut interest rates. As cases rise, more businesses are shutting their doors to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>The healthcare industry is one of the economic sectors affected by the outbreak. This pandemic may put considerable stress on hospitals, medical practices, and health care workers. It is difficult to accurately predict how the system will hold up under the potential influx of patients. Things like revenue, supplies, staffing, billing, and resources will likely be affected. How it reacts will likely impact future changes to the U.S. healthcare system.</p>\r\n<h2>Changes and Risks For Healthcare Workers</h2>\r\n<p>Given that they care for infected individuals, medical workers are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 than those in other fields. As hospital and doctor visits for the virus rise, it could pose a greater risk for healthcare workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends following their own <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/steps-to-prepare.html\" target=\"_blank\">procedure and guidelines</a> to help prevent those in the healthcare industry and their patients from getting sick. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has also published a detailed article about <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html\" target=\"_blank\">working during the outbreak of this virus</a>.</p>   \r\n<p>One subset of the medical sector that is benefiting from COVID-19 is telehealth. Telehealth is a category of healthcare services that provides doctor visits remotely. In recent weeks, telehealth companies and their affiliated medical practices have experienced an increase in business and attention. In anticipation of this, Congress passed a bill which <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/telehealth-benefits-medicare-are-lifeline-patients-during-coronavirus-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">waived telehealth service restrictions to seniors on Medicare.</a> This could be an effective way to limit exposure and mitigate the spread of the virus while still receiving medical care.</p>  \r\n<h2>Impact On Dental Practices</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 outbreak also affects dentists and their staff. On Monday, the American Dental Association (ADA) <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2020-archive/march/ada-recommending-dentists-postpone-elective-procedures\" target=\"_blank\">recommended that dentists postpone elective procedures</a> for at least three weeks. This was outlined in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. The ADA specified that dental offices should focus on treating patients with urgent and emergency cases so that those with these levels of dental issues will not be placing additional stress on already overworked hospitals. Additionally, the CDC has issued <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/summary-infection-prevention-practices/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a> to dental offices for preventing the spread of the virus.</p>\r\n<h2>COVID-19 Funding Bill</h2>\r\n<p>The President signed an $8.3 billion <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6074/text\" target=\"_blank\">emergency spending bill</a> on Friday aimed at treating and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Over $3 billion of the bill fund went to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use flexibly. $950 million went to fund state and local health sectors for things like staffing and other critical needs. Additionally, $300 million went toward vaccine and treatment research, development, and production. Lastly, $1.25 billion went to international activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dental practices, medical practices, and businesses will likely see several changes during the COVID-19 outbreak. While these changes may present new challenges, companies can implement changes of their own to help navigate the changing landscape. It is vital to remain informed and utilize resources provided by the government and other organizations so that businesses can better adapt to the COVID-19 environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

If you have seen Johns<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/interpreting-the-data-on-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>It can be overwhelming to try to navigate all the news concerning the coronavirus pandemic. If you have seen <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\" target=\"_blank\">Johns Hopkins University’s heat map of coronavirus COVID-19 global cases,</a> you may be feeling lost and confused about interpreting the actual and logarithmic data, along with the daily cases reported. The high numbers of confirmed cases and deaths may seem intimidating, but what do they really mean in the grand scheme of things?</p> \r\n<h2>Actual vs. Logarithmic Data</h2>\r\n<p>On the Johns Hopkins University graph for actual data, data is spaced out by every 20,000 cases. In other words, the chart is spaced out linearly and evenly. This is known as an arithmetic graph, where equal distances represent equal amounts. Most people are most familiar with this type of chart because of its straightforward nature.</p>\r\n<p>The JHU graph for logarithmic data, however, spaces out data from 10 to 1,000 to 100,000. Instead of representing equal amounts, equal distances represent equal rates. In this case, each distance represents 10%. This makes it more useful in comparing rates of change.</p>\r\n<h2>Daily Rates of COVID-19 Growth</h2>\r\n<p>It would be easy to interpret the JHU graph for actual data as proof that the daily rates of (1) novel coronavirus growth outside of mainland China and (2) total recovered worldwide have been skyrocketing since February. Looking at this graph may be disheartening, as it seems to indicate an unstoppable daily uptick in novel coronavirus cases.</p>\r\n<p>However, the logarithmic data shows us that the daily growth rates of COVID-19 outside of mainland China are <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-data-do-not-support-global-alarmism-by-anatole-kaletsky-2020-03\" target=\"_blank\">actually slowing down.</a></p>\r\n<h2>Interpreting COVID-19 Maps</h2>\r\n<p>Some may also find it panic-inducing to look at JHU’s map. It is crucial to remember that the data presented does not give viewers an idea of the number of cases relative to the population. In other words, the map is using actual data. By failing to list population numbers and focusing only on COVID-19-related statistics, the map may render viewers unable to establish a baseline for comparison.</p>\r\n<p>JHU’s map partially compensates for this by implementing proportional symbols in marking each region, meaning larger circles represent larger numbers of cumulative confirmed cases. Thus, viewers may be able to see which countries are more affected than others — though not proportionately so.</p>\r\n<h2>Significance of Current Data</h2>\r\n<p>The actual data suggests that cases exploded in mainland China from mid-January to early February before finally beginning to flatten out in mid-February. Additionally, the graph indicates that the total recovery rate has been on the rise. Logarithmic data confirms both of these assumptions while simultaneously showing that recovery rates may be leveling out — likely correlated with the overall slowing of new COVID-19 diagnoses.</p>\r\n<p>All of this indicates that flattening the curve is still very possible, provided individuals <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/\" target=\"_blank\">stick to necessary precautions like social distancing.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the high numbers reported in COVID-19 statistics may be intimidating, they must be taken in context. Understanding how to correctly interpret the data on COVID-19 is imperative in reducing sensationalism and panic. Staying calm and keeping a clear head can help aid you in taking the preventative steps needed to keep both yourself and those around you safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

With its widespread nature, governments and organizations<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/managing-loans-amid-coronavirus/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The World Health Organization announced Wednesday that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814474930/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says\" target=\"_blank\">coronavirus (COVID-19) is officially a pandemic</a>. With its widespread nature, governments and organizations are implementing protective measures. Many are restricting their travel, working from home, and avoiding large groups of people. These things, and other factors, are presenting businesses with a variety of challenges.</p>\r\n<p>One question many business owners are asking themselves is, “How will I be able to manage my business’s finances during this time?” Managing loans or just keeping a business afloat during a lull or shutdown period brought on by COVID-19 can be challenging and confusing. Fortunately, there are some ways businesses can plan and navigate this turbulent environment.</p>\r\n<h2>Common Issues Businesses May Encounter</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has unfortunately presented businesses with a list of potential problems. While it is important not to panic, it is just as important to be aware of some of the possible factors. Access to capital may be the biggest concern for businesses. Things like payroll and inventory are affected by market fluctuations, so businesses should prepare by assessing their access options as soon as possible so that they can adjust accordingly. Fortunately, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has rolled out an assistance plan for small businesses affected by COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>There are additional factors to consider. These include workforce capacity, employee wellbeing, inventory, supply chain, insurance coverage issues, changing market demand, marketing, and cleanup. It is critical to contact insurance providers and suppliers to get a read on the situation. Additionally, business owners and managers should be <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html\" target=\"_blank\">developing contingency plans</a> for the factors above, whether the overall situation becomes worse, stays the same, or starts to improve. Doing so will mitigate the collateral damage leveed on your business by the virus.</p>\r\n<h2>Decreasing Revenue With Oncoming Loan Payments and Other Expenses</h2>\r\n<p>A significant potential challenge for companies is losing business while still having to make payments on loans, rent, and other expenses. While this may seem like an insurmountable situation at first, there are steps people can take to mitigate some of the damage to their business.</p>\r\n<h3>FDIC and Banks</h3>\r\n<p>On March 9, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) released <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/coronavirus/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">a statement</a> that they are working with federal and state banking agencies to help customers who are affected by COVID-19. Additionally, the FDIC stated that regulatory agencies are encouraging financial institutions to work with customers. This is potentially good news for those businesses facing less revenue and mounting payments.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, companies can reach out to their issuers, and inquire if they may be willing to adjust their existing payment plan. Also, if a business has an emergency savings fund, it may need to start dipping into it until it resolves payment issues.</p>\r\n<h3>The White House and SBA Assistance</h3>\r\n<p>President Trump has signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-taken-unprecedented-steps-respond-coronavirus-protect-health-safety-americans/\" target=\"_blank\">economic assistance package</a> into effect to help assist both businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. This comes as one of the numerous steps the federal government has recently taken to deal with the mounting situation in America.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the federal government has instructed the SBA to supply affordable loans that will assist businesses and workers affected by the outbreak. Congress is in talks to fund the program with an additional $50 billion. The SBA has also provided <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/page/guidance-businesses-employers-plan-respond-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19#section-header-4\" target=\"_blank\">resources and guidance for businesses</a> on their website.</p>\r\n<p>As the situation develops, so too may the potential challenges for businesses. Owners and workers can better navigate these hurdles by adopting a proactive approach, by utilizing government assistance, and by continually staying informed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have provided href=&#8221;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html&#8221;_blank&#8221;>interim guidance for businesses and workers during the COVID-19 outbreak</a> on their website.</p>\r\n\r\n<b><p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
