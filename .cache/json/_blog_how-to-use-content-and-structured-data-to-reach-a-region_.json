The internet has made it easier than ever for consumers to find providers beyond their local regions and to consult with physicians states or even countries away. While this ease of access is great for individuals, it creates a highly competitive landscape for health care providers, as you may well know. As a result, you as a provider should continually look for opportunities to optimize your site not just for search, but for local search. While SEO content is one of the strongest ways to do this, structured data — or “schema markup” — can put you well ahead of the competition.  </p>\r\n<h2>Understanding structured data</h2>\r\n<p>Structured data markup helps define information in such a way that the search bots can better understand the context of your page, delivering “rich snippets.” HTML, on the other hand, simply tells the bots how to display text included in a tag.</p>\r\n<p>Neil Patel explains the <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.\">ins and outs of schema markup</a>. In a nutshell, schema markup can help you create a virtual business card. While non-marked-up results pull from title tags and meta descriptions to return generic information about your practice, marked-up results can show users everything from your practice’s name to its ratings to its hours, all right there in the SERPs. Before rich snippets were introduced, this kind of data — numbers, ratings, etc. — were not understood by the search bots and, therefore, ignored.</p>\r\n<h2>Using structured data to reach local patients</h2>\r\n<p>The most obvious way structured data can help you reach and attract local patients is by helping Google read items such as your map and phone number so it can include that information in the SERPs. While your content probably mentions your city and state several times for SEO purposes, schema markup makes it possible to show potential patients exactly where you are located, down to the suite number.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, location is just one factor patients consider before selecting a provider. Patients also want to find a provider who is in the right field, who offers their insurance, and who has stellar patient reviews. Unlike HTML tags, which offer you limited space to tell searchers what your practice is about, structured data lets you <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0\">describe a page in as detailed a manner as possible</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For example, in the “@type” section, you can describe the type of content your page promises. In the “@description” section, you can include what you do (“A cosmetic dentist with 15 years of perfecting smiles.”) and/or a list of insurance your practice accepts. The “aggregate rating” section lets you input your best and worst ratings, and Google will deliver the average. All of the information you choose to put in your markup can help local searchers make the most informed decisions possible without them ever having to click through to your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Create meaningful results</h2>\r\n<p>From <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">writing for skimmers</a> to writing for the search bots, our team at Doctor Genius is familiar with the strongest tactics for attracting new patients and ranking well in the search engines.

In a world where many consumers and clients rely on what they read on the internet, having a page that ranks highly in search returns can make or break the traffic through your practice. When a potential client takes a look at your site, you want to be sure that you have created the kind of content marketing that keeps them reading and, even better, has them calling to make an appointment. One page you may want to consider incorporating is one that answers frequently asked questions. Since there are almost always general and common questions, getting them out of the way up front may improve the user&#8217;s impression of your practice immediately.</p>\r\n<h2>Reasons FAQ pages may help elevate your practice</h2>\r\n<p>Your main objective on your practice web page is to get potential clients interested in your business. You want to entice them with colorful pictures, engaging blog content, and convincing reasons why they should choose you. The FAQ page offers another opportunity to peak reader interest, and according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/02/12/making-seo-a-game-changer-for-your-business/#698e6b2e26c4\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/02/12/making-seo-a-game-changer-for-your-business/#698e6b2e26c4\">Forbes.com</a>, maximize SEO to elevate your practice&#8217;s web presence.</p>\r\n<h3>Establishes trust</h3>\r\n<p>Some medical issues may prove more difficult for clients to talk about than others. The FAQ section is the place where you can place sensitive and perhaps embarrassing client questions. As readers cycle through your site, give them the most uncomfortable queries relevant to your practice, and answer them in simple terms. This not only establishes you as an authority but as a practice that makes people feel at ease.</p>\r\n<h3>Informs clients</h3>\r\n<p>You should have information about your practice plastered all over your site. Including some <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-presenting-content-in-more-than-one-form/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-presenting-content-in-more-than-one-form/\">facts and figures in the FAQ section</a> can go a long way with potential clients. Doing it here can serve a couple of purposes. It gives information to those who want to read about it. You also can control how insight into your practice is presented and what you choose to provide.</p>\r\n<h3>Allows interaction</h3>\r\n<p>Establishing a page that does not allow readers to interact with you may turn some people away. If set up correctly, the FAQ page can allow you to field questions from readers and add them to the list you have already compiled. Answering comments or questions shows potential clients that you are attentive and care enough to address further queries. </p>\r\n<h3>Captures searches</h3>\r\n<p>Frequently asked questions contain common SEO keywords. When a person starts looking for these terms, your FAQ page may come back in the search. When this happens, it gives your website more visibility and may even net you a new client. Ensuring that your entire site is SEO friendly can work to drive more business to your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>We have solutions</h2>\r\n<p>Our team of pros at Doctor Genius is dedicated to working diligently towards getting your practice&#8217;s website optimized for maximum traction.

Without the requisite knowledge to inform<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>As a medical provider, staying on top of new advances and developments is crucial. Without the requisite knowledge to inform patients of options and effectively treat them, you will not only suffer a loss of business, but you also may suffer a loss of professional integrity. While it is essential to stay grounded in older routines and those products that are still relevant, newer tools may provide more opportunities to attract new clients and offer new options to existing ones. Understanding what happens from the time medical products are introduced until they become irrelevant may help when it comes to medical marketing.</p>\r\n<h2>Staying informed of new trends</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to providing the best options for patient treatment, technological trends and developments are crucial. The ability to introduce patients to a full array of potential solutions to health problems results in a higher rate of successful recovery. Keeping an eye on medical journals, doing independent research on clinical trials, and speaking with an equipment representative may prove sufficient to stay abreast of trends.</p>\r\n<h2>The stages of medical products</h2>\r\n<p>Once a new medical product becomes available, company reps strive to reach relevant practices. The more medical providers use it and prescribe it, the higher the chance that it will gain notoriety. According to <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534\">thestreet.com</a>, typical product lifecycle management contains four benchmarks: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Each of these stages requires unique marketing strategies to remain competitive.</p>\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Bringing a new medical product to the market can prove difficult, especially if the first phase of the lifecycle is not successful. In the introduction, the company is trying to gain some awareness of the product. Activities during this time include promotions geared towards those medical practices that have patients who may benefit from the new product. </p>\r\n<h3>Growth</h3>\r\n<p>Once the product finds a measure of success, the distributor will want to broaden its horizons and target other areas of the medical community that might utilize it. The distributor may start to change the branding of the product to make it more appealing to a broader audience. Something used primarily for one health condition may be pushed for aiding with another. As long as the data backs up the claims, providers may give it a try.</p>\r\n<h3>Maturity</h3>\r\n<p>Business strategy changes the more successful a product becomes. When product sales plateau, it is a signal that it has reached maturity. To keep the company&#8217;s name at the forefront of the medical community, it now has to make some clear changes to the product or its marketing. In some cases, this results in a 2.0 version of the same item.</p>\r\n<h3>Decline</h3>\r\n<p>When competitors introduce rival products, and sales start to decrease, the lifecycle is declining. This means that a company must either completely reformulate and reintroduce the product or come up with something new.</p>\r\n<h2>Help when you need it</h2>\r\n<p>Convincing clients that your practice is on top of the latest medical products and trends gives them confidence that you are looking out for the best avenues for treatment.
