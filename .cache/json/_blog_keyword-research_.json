However, identifying which keywords or keyword phrases will deliver the desired results can be difficult without fundamental knowledge on the subject. No matter the current size or impact of your office’s website, it is essential you are ready with your toolbox of sources and methods for using the most effective keywords on every page.</p>\r\n<h2>Consider your specialty and customer base</h2>\r\n<p>Before you even jump on your computer to starting searching for keywords to include in your content, you need to first take time to brainstorm what your office has to offer and what your customers want and expect from your services.</p>\r\n<h3>Determine your niche</h3>\r\n<p>While you may assume that using broad keywords will help you draw in a larger group of people, focusing on certain specialties or your business&#8217;s niche has several benefits. For one, common, more general terms, such as “dentist” or “chiropractor,” are often more highly competed for, making it very difficult for smaller companies to rank well on search engines when up against well-established, national brands. In contrast, honing in on more specific services you offer or areas you specialize in, such as “GERD treatment” or “children dentistry” reduces the competition.</p>\r\n<p>Also, focusing your keyword research on your niche allows you to better target the exact type of customers who are likely to be interested in your services. For instance, if someone has a root canal that needs to be addressed, using the term “root canal treatment” can guide this individual to your page. This not only helps generates leads but is much more likely to result in a conversion</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on location</h3>\r\n<p>As a medical professional, you likely have an office that serves a specific area. Many customer searches including a local component, so centering your keywords on the city, state, or region in which you offer your services is an easy and effective way to better target your intended audience and to potentially rank on the first page of search engines. This includes taking both broad and specific terms and including a location in the keyword phrase, such as “TMJ doctor Spokane” or “orthodontist Sacramento area.”</p>\r\n<h2>Use tools to find effective keywords</h2>\r\n<p>The second part of results-producing keyword research is using the right tools to help you find keywords that fit your niche and target audience. Since many people use Google as their primary search engine, using Google-specific resources can be helpful:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Google Analytics</li>\r\n\t<li>Google Search Console</li>\r\n\t<li>Google Trends</li>\r\n\t<li>Google Keyword Planner</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are also third-party tools to explore, including SEM Rush, Keyword Tool, Moz Keyword Explorer, Ahrefs Keyword Explorer, and SpyFu.</p>\r\n<h2>Gain even more visibility on search engines</h2>\r\n<p>If you are ready to take your content marketing to the next level and want to see real results from your efforts, our team at Doctor Genius has the resources to get you there.

Creating a shiny new website for your company is only half the battle — the rest involves filling in content that is engaging, useful, and informative to your customers. Keywords within that content are crucial for designing search engine optimization to bring to your site customers who might not know about your business and what you do. To take advantage of the latest search trends, you need to know why certain keywords and subjects are important for your business and how to use them effectively in content.</p>\r\n<h2>The importance of search trends</h2>\r\n<p>Search trends can be broken down into several categories. One involves seasonal change, e.g., consumers may be more interested in buying products during the summer than in the winter. Another is all about keywords, which are specific words or short phrases you use in the content of your website that a search engine matches to the search words someone has typed in. The more you incorporate those keywords, the higher your content will rank in engines like Google. Learning how to use these trends to guide your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\">latest article or blog topics</a> can keep your content relevant and appealing.</p>\r\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>To narrow down keywords that fit within the context of your work, you first have to figure out what consumers are searching for and what they are not. You can use the latest trends and analytics to narrow down keywords that match what your clients type into Google. Consider using a mix of short-tail and long-tail keywords to diversify your SEO and attract a wide variety of clients.</p>\r\n<h3>Short-tail keywords</h3>\r\n<p>As the name suggests, short-tail keywords are made up of three or fewer words. These are often incredibly broad and more frequently searched for. There are benefits and drawbacks to using shorter keywords. Your content is more likely to rank with a shorter keyword because so many articles can fit in the general topic. This allows for more people, particularly new customers, to find your page. However, your webpage will be competing with numerous other pages with the same keyword, sometimes in the thousands, making it less likely to rank higher in the results list.</p>\r\n<h3>Long-tail keywords</h3>\r\n<p>When you want to attract customers looking for something more specific, long-tail keywords are ideal. Longer keywords and phrases narrow down the search significantly, and while a keyword over three words long may not be searched for as frequently as shorter ones, someone who types it in is probably looking for exactly what you have to offer. It also makes your site <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274809\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274809\">more likely to rank higher</a> in the list of search engine results.</p>\r\n<h2>Tools to discover search trends</h2>\r\n<p>You can use any of these tools for search analytics to discover search trends and keywords:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Google Analytics</li>\r\n\t<li>Matomo</li>\r\n\t<li>Woopra</li>\r\n\t<li>GoSquared</li>\r\n\t<li>FoxMetrics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you have established a list of keywords and trends, you can confidently start using them in your content marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<h2>Find out more about searched subjects</h2>\r\n<p>Give your website the greatest chance to succeed by researching keywords and trends. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for help identifying the searched subjects for your business.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Writing great, engaging content is not enough to pull in a wider audience. Your website needs to consistently top the results page on Google and other search engines to catch customers who randomly search for a product you offer — after all, most people are likely to click on just the first five results. Identifying keywords that will boost your website rank is a good start, but it is not all you can do. Understanding how to analyze data about rankings and pageviews can help you strengthen weak points across the site.</p>\r\n<h2>Taking full advantage of analytics</h2>\r\n<p>Learning how to read and assess the data from your analytics software can help you develop new content marketing strategies that improve your site’s search engine optimization. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/01/02/nine-things-to-know-about-google-analytics/#1083137f6cb9\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/01/02/nine-things-to-know-about-google-analytics/#1083137f6cb9\">Google Analytics</a> and other comparable software guide you to identify keywords that your target audience searches for, discover your most popular pages, and help you generate more beneficial leads. Here are steps for getting the most out of your search analytics.    </p>\r\n<h3>Search for organic landing pages</h3>\r\n<p>One of the greatest advantages of using analytic software is that you can search for organic landing pages. These are the pages of your website that people visit the most frequently simply by typing in a search word or phrase into an engine without being brought there by advertisements. Discovering your most popular landing pages are essential because it tells you what your audience enjoys and finds interesting on your site. You can then create links on your popular pages to other related content, which builds a great internal linking system that also helps your site rate better on Google overall.  </p>\r\n<h3>Measure the quality of visitors</h3>\r\n<p>The number of site visitors and length of pageviews are quantitative data that are easy to measure, but how do you measure the quality of those who see your site? You can judge quality by determining how many people end up on your website because of organic SEO. Furthermore, an organic search that results in leads (customers who give you contact information, like an email signup) is more valuable than an organic search that does not. Use this data to see how it stands up to different marketing campaigns that you implement through advertisements or social media.</p>\r\n<h3>Update popular pages</h3>\r\n<p>On any software, it is simple to see what pages are your top performers. Make it a habit to regularly check how pages are performing and where improvements can be made. If a page has significantly lost organic traffic, use active marketing tactics for it (like pay-per-click ads). Some pages may only need an <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/setting-up-a-blog-schedule/\">update in content</a>, while others might require a change in keywords. Look carefully at what links attract the most clicks to other content on your site. Constantly analyzing and refining your content layout and information can optimize the most popular pages so that you receive more pageviews and more business.</p>\r\n<h3>Identify searches that lead to your site</h3>\r\n<p>A fantastic element of your analytical toolbox is the ability to see what visitors searched for before clicking on your website. It is considerably easier to determine keywords to include in your content when you can view each customer’s search terms. The overall list of search words can be overwhelming, so filter it down by matching keywords to corresponding pages and focus on the pages that have a greater chance of rating higher in the results list. By placing emphasis on the right keywords and most successful pages, you can increase your online ranking.</p>\r\n<h3>Assess campaigns on other sites</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to tracking the stats on your own site, you can also track ad campaigns that you have on third-party websites. You can place email and promotional campaigns in a single list to see how they compare to one another. Use the list to clearly see the campaigns that generate the greatest traffic to your site and the content that attracts your main target audience.</p>\r\n<h2>Software for analyzing your ranking</h2>\r\n<p>Google Analytics is a popular software for a reason: It is reliable, comprehensive, and highly detailed — but that should not keep you from trying other software too. Knowing what your options are can help you decide what is right for your business. Some companies prefer to monitor SEO and organic pageviews through multiple analytic programs to understand exactly where improvements can be made. Here are alternative options if you are exploring new avenues.</p>\r\n<h3>GoSquared</h3>\r\n<p>This software is great for those who want to add a little extra to the regular analytics software. Companies can improve relationships with customers with GoSquared’s live chat option. You can also research customer browsing histories to investigate keywords and topics that led them to your site.</p>\r\n<h3>Matomo</h3>\r\n<p>If you are changing over to Matomo from Google Analytics, you do not need to worry about losing valuable data that is stored in Google. Matomo allows you to transfer old data into it to continue current analysis. This is also a good option for businesses looking to ensure security, as you can use it on your private server (the cloud is available too).</p>\r\n<h3>FoxMetrics</h3>\r\n<p>If you want to get a better handle on customer information, like the kinds of keywords that are searched for to find your page, consider FoxMetrics. This tool stores all of your data in a single bank for quick access and new reports, making it easy to research the keywords that drive the most traffic to your site.</p>\r\n<h3>Woopra</h3>\r\n<p>Woopra is all about instant response and service with a support team that is available to help with marketing and sales. The team can even respond to messages or new leads as soon as they happen in real time on your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn how to improve your online ranking</h2>\r\n<p>There is no doubt that all analytical tools come with a steep learning curve with information and data that might be difficult to discern right away.
