Utilizing keywords does nothing<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When optimizing your practice&#8217;s webpage to boost its ranking in searches, keywords are only the beginning. Utilizing keywords does nothing if readers do not read your posts. You want high conversion numbers, and shorter attention spans may put even the most SEO-optimized site at risk. Learn how to create articles that readers can quickly skim to glean the highlights.</p>\r\n<h2>How ranking and content work together</h2>\r\n<p>Google uses algorithms to increase a page&#8217;s visibility during a search return. The higher your site ranks, the more likely a potential client is to click on your page. However, getting clicks is just the beginning. Your content format must also engage and appeal to your practice&#8217;s target audience. Your blog posts should be easy to read, focusing on <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/\">topics and information relevant</a> to your practice. When we at DG create content, we focus on making them topical and easy to read.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing blogs for your target audience</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/\">Time magazine</a>, the average person gives an article approximately 15 seconds before abandoning it. You have to hook potential clients in that short time. Utilizing methods designed to provide them with information in easy-to-digest chunks can help. Employing several methods in posts to increase reader engagement may translate into more appointments for your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Headings</h3>\r\n<p>A good strategy to help appeal to a skimmer is utilizing headings. As in this article, paragraph headers break up content by topics. While this alone may not be enough to convey your message to readers, it can direct the eyes to the portions of your content that appeal directly to them. For instance, if your interest lies in creating lists, you may jump to the heading entitled &#8220;Bullet Points&#8221; in this article. Headings direct readers to the information they seek.</p>\r\n<h3>Bullet points</h3>\r\n<p>As a way to further maximize skimming, integrate bullet points and lists into your posts. There are a variety of ways you can do this effectively. Try not to overuse this method as your content will wind up looking like a to-do list rather than an informative and engaging post. Some elements that lend themselves easily to bullet lists include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Symptoms and signs</li>\r\n\t<li>Frequently prescribed medications</li>\r\n\t<li>Common diagnoses</li>\r\n\t<li>Treatment options</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When readers start by reading lists, it may catch their attention and prompt them to finish the article for more insight.</p>\r\n<h3>Visual aids</h3>\r\n<p>People may gravitate to posts that contain visual content other than words. Integrating photographs, graphs, and charts into your content may capture potential clients by giving them something colorful to ponder. Visual representations of medical conditions, such as cavities, may also help readers understand what they need to watch for in themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Get help hooking clients</h2>\r\n<p>Your practice hinges on new patients, and grabbing their attention requires content that is easily digestible and informative.

While neural matching has not replaced the previous algorithms used to generate Google search results, it does play a role in how the latest Google core update ranks webpages.</p>\r\n<h2>Neural matching</h2>\r\n<p>Google has always been somewhat secretive about how its search algorithms work. Additionally, the company does not use every algorithm it has developed and does not usually disclose which algorithms are in use at any one time. The reasoning is that if Google revealed exactly how the algorithms work, it would be easy for users to exploit them to artificially boost their pages to the top of the search results. </p>\r\n<h3>What neural matching is</h3>\r\n<p>Neural matching is part of the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">most recent update</a> to Google&#8217;s search algorithm. It utilizes artificial intelligence to make search results more diverse. The use of AI technology makes it easier for the Google search engine to analyze language and interpret the intent of search queries. This allows Google to match a webpage to a query based solely on the text of the webpage. </p>\r\n<p>One way the neural matching algorithm is expected to improve the search engine&#8217;s ability to interpret queries is by making it better at recognizing when people search for a term that means the same thing as a keyword on a webpage. It is estimated that this algorithm will affect about 30% of user queries.</p>\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/\">research paper released by Google</a>, the algorithm may use document relevance ranking to determine the best search results while avoiding spam and irrelevant results. In other words, this algorithm could help the search engine figure out which results are the best and rank those the highest while pushing pages that try to game the system or have little relevance to the query lower in the rankings. </p>\r\n<h3>How neural matching affects search engine optimization</h3>\r\n<p>The core concept of neural matching is to reward content creators for effectively answering the questions posed by users in queries and de-emphasize the role of links and keywords. However, this does not mean that Google has completely abandoned the traditional ranking criteria used by the core algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>Rather, it is believed that the traditional criteria are applied first to thin the herd by removing spam and irrelevant pages from the results. Then, the new algorithm is used to re-rank the remaining results, so that the most useful results receive the top rankings. Doctor Genius can help content creators improve page rankings by creating content that is useful to users while also establishing the basic credibility and relevance of the content by attracting high-quality backlinks and including relevant keywords.</p>\r\n<h2>Optimize your SEO</h2>\r\n<p>The implementation of neural matching has not radically changed how Google rankings work. However, it could impact how your pages rank. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact Doctor Genius today</a> to find out how we can help you optimize your pages to make the most of this new neural matching algorithm. </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

But how? Taking a thorough and comprehensive analysis of industry standards, industry metrics, online presence, services offered, and the overall online strategy for your business can dramatically impact the direction your business will go.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Most recently, a study conducted by Local Med stated that, </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"padding: 0 2%;\">During quarantine, hygiene appointments weren&#8217;t happening. And that means those appointments weren&#8217;t being reappointed either. A deep dive into Dental Intelligence&#8217;s data has shown us that all across the country, hygiene chairs are less than 15% scheduled in September, October, and November.”</blockquote>\r\n<p>Just like any other area of your business, conducting a statistical analysis of your missed appointments, no shows, and gaps in scheduling are a great place to start in order to identify ways to improve and maximize the hygiene department`s productivity.</p>\r\n<h3>Why Did Appointments Dip in 2020?</h3>\r\n<p>Since March, medical <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/dont-avoid-your-doctor-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">visits have declined</a>, despite the impact doctors warn it could have on the nation’s health. Polling indicates that people are typically more fearful of going anywhere. A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/recession-invest-in-marketing-for-the-win/\">we looked at</a> the economic impact this is having on businesses and steps professionals can take to remain successful during a financial downturn. This is why the onus is on the dentist to schedule more appointments by reaching out to patients again.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2379\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg\" alt=\"Scheduled Hygiene Production\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-300x212.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-768x542.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog-post-graphs-1-177x125.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\r\n<h3>How do we fix this?</h3>\r\n<p>By gaining more market share! We need to fill the gaps in your schedule by creating more awareness online that your practice is accepting new patients. We need to expand your online footprint and market your practice the <i>right</i> way!</p>\r\n<p>Dental Intelligence/Local Med adds that, “Normally, hygiene schedules are 80% full. But now they&#8217;re 80% empty. It&#8217;s vital to take steps now in order to be on track to see as many of your hygiene patients as possible.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>After auditing our own Doctor Genius client’s online and internal performance, we found that this was an overall trend for almost all dentists. It’s crucial to understand and correct this as soon as possible to ensure you’re maximizing each area of your dental practice in regard to consistency and improved performance over time. </p>\r\n<h3>We’re here to help!</h3>\r\n<p>Since dentists are experiencing fluctuations in scheduling hygiene appointments during the quarantine, even with rescheduling efforts, there will still be a gap of incoming patients equivalent to that gap. However, clients of Doctor Genius have an online presence and system in place to continue scheduling appointments, rescheduling appointments, and focusing on patient retention efforts.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can identify areas of opportunity to benefit a client’s practice, boost their online presence, and help increase practice sustainability during these uncertain times. With COVID-19 continuing to alter the medical landscape in numerous ways, it is crucial to have a plan that can adapt to this climate. Our team will help clients learn how to utilize their online reach to continue seeing current patients while bringing in new patients.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the process, Doctor Genius can help you know where you are, understand your gap analysis, and develop a plan for how to proceed.
