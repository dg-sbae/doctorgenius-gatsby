For others, however, it did little to sway their enthusiasm for SMM. If anything, it bolstered it, as those organizations realized that what value they could derive from social would only increase as their competition dropped off the channels. What kind of value, though, did those marketers recognize that others did not?</p>\r\n<h2>The value of dental social media marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Social media content and engagement may not directly impact your dental practice’s rankings in search, but that does not mean you should forego an SMM campaign entirely. Below are a few reasons to invest in an SMM strategy in 2021:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Nearly 50% of the world’s population — or nearly 4 billion people — have active social media accounts.</li>\r\n\t<li>54% of social media users use social media to research products or services.</li>\r\n\t<li>The average person logs into Facebook at least nine times a day and spends between 2.5 and three hours on social media.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your audience is on social media, and members are using it to guide their purchase decisions — two major reasons you should make SMM part of your dental digital marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<h2>Social channels your dental practice should not ignore</h2>\r\n<p>Armed with the before-mentioned data, you may be ready to make SMM part of your dentist SEO strategy. However, before you do, know that more is not always better. It is important that you focus your efforts on the channels most popular and widely used with your particular audience; otherwise, they may fall flat. Though the most effective platforms will vary from practice to practice, a few are more popular than others.</p>\r\n<h3>Facebook</h3>\r\n<p>Nearly 70% of Americans use Facebook and, of those, approximately three-quarters of active users check their accounts daily. The largest percentage of users at 61% are Americans between the ages of 25 and 61, which is the target demographic for many dental professionals. As an advertising platform, Facebook is great for lead generation as it allows you to create customized ads and target them to a very specific audience. It is also a great platform on which you can build relationships and turn followers into loyal customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Pinterest</h3>\r\n<p>As a visually driven platform, Pinterest is a great place to showcase before and after photos. Pinterest’s audience consists mostly of women — or, more specifically, moms. According to <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/pinterest-statistics-for-business/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/pinterest-statistics-for-business/\">the data</a>, 80% of Pinterest users are women between the age of 18 and 64 with children. Moreover, more than 90% of users browse the platform with the intent to make a purchase. If you want to target the decision-makers of the family, Pinterest is the platform on which to do so.</p>\r\n<h3>Twitter</h3>\r\n<p>Twitter is a great platform on which to publish announcements, important messages, deals, breaking news, and other time-sensitive information. Most Twitter users are under the age of 50 and prefer short, digestible snippets of textual content, such as listicles, articles, and quotations.</p>\r\n<h2>Work with Doctor Genius to identify effective marketing channels</h2>\r\n<p>Though social media may not impact your rankings in search directly, SMM is still a crucial component of any effective <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\">content marketing campaign</a> — especially during this era of social distancing.

It is a way to be more regularly active<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/should-you-cross-post-on-social-media-to-promote-a-medical-practice/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Cross-posting can be enticing when you are building your medical practice. It is a way to be more regularly active on your social media platforms without exerting extra effort, saving you valuable time. However, because most social media sites run on different formats with different goals, cross-posting is not always a sound strategy. Posting an identical message on both Facebook and Twitter can have negative effects on your medical content marketing; such duplication simply does not work in today’s buzzing world of social media.</p>\r\n<h2>When to cross-post</h2>\r\n<p>Marketing over social media for doctors is no different than marketing for any other business. You need to take the time to determine how each media platform’s audience scans and digests information and how to optimize your posts so they reach the most people. Understanding how to effectively cross-post between platforms is as essential as knowing when you simply need new content among your accounts.</p>\r\n<h3>The harm of posting identical content</h3>\r\n<p>Every social media platform provides a different experience for users and usually caters to different audiences. For example, statista.com reports that males between the ages of 25 and 34 make up the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/\">largest demographic on Facebook</a>, but users above the age of 40 are the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/246172/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-linkedin-by-age-group/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20third%20quarter,25%20years%20did%20the%20same.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/246172/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-linkedin-by-age-group/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20third%20quarter,25%20years%20did%20the%20same.\">largest group on LinkedIn</a>. A message posted on Facebook aimed at younger users is not going to have the same impact with users on LinkedIn, and the same goes for Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest. In fact, slapping identical content across all of your accounts can lose current patients instead of gaining more.</p>\r\n<h3>The benefit of cross-promoting</h3>\r\n<p>Though cross-posting can negatively impact your image on social media, you can still promote identical content from your website — you only need to change how the information is presented across the platforms. Every time you have a new blog post or new page you want to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\">share with patients</a> and online followers, create a separate promotion for each media account that fits the audience and format. To post on Twitter, make sure your message is concise and under 280 characters. On Instagram, include a high-quality image and a fun or insightful story to go with it. Changing up similar content can lead more users back to your website from every social site.</p>\r\n<h2>How to effectively cross-promote</h2>\r\n<p>When you are ready to promote new content, sit down and write a brief summary (a few sentences should do) of what you want current and potential patients to know about the content. Then incorporate that summary into a different post for each platform, making sure to abide by character limits, audience constraints, and general guidelines. If you find that one type of post works particularly well on a certain site, continue using it as a template for future posts on that site. Once you get a feel for what posts work better on each site, writing promotions becomes much easier and takes less time.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover effective ways to promote on social media</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can work with you to create effective promotions and posts that engage your audience and reach more patients. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> to discover the latest trends in social media marketing.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 16800 Aston Street, Suite 270, Irvine, CA 92606, provides a range of services for practice success.

Find out how to raise your healthcare SEO by creating a calendar to post content to your practice&#8217;s social media accounts automatically.</p>\r\n<h2>Medical practice marketing using social media</h2>\r\n<p>People have become reliant on social media for providing insight into potential products and services. Hashtags have become a starting point for everything from news articles to reviews. Using hashtags and SEO keywords in blog posts makes it more likely that your content is seen. The more relevant and engaging content you post, the higher your webpage views can climb and yield new clients for your practice.

Finding an effective way to post content frequently may come down to using a social media calendar.</p>\r\n<h3>Promote your practice regularly</h3>\r\n<p>You use a calendar to plan your day and schedule patients. It allows you to see upcoming events and ensure that you have the necessary tools well in advance. The same logic applies to a social media calendar. This tool allows you to plan your practice&#8217;s blogs in advance and have them automatically posted on the days and times you choose. Scheduling posts helps you to maximize timing trends for social media users. Utilize a social media calendar for your practice to provide a steady stream of insight to users.</p>\r\n<h3>Capitalize on healthcare trends</h3>\r\n<p>Coming up with relevant topics may be one of the most difficult parts of writing blog posts. You want to create engaging posts that drive traffic to your practice&#8217;s website from social media outlets. A calendar can help with content planning by allowing you to capitalize on relevant <a href=\"https://nationaltoday.com/health-holidays/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://nationaltoday.com/health-holidays/\">healthcare awareness days</a>. Blog posts centered around these medical topics and how they relate back to your practice can be written on your timetable but set to post on social media during the relevant dates. This ultimately raises the practice&#8217;s visibility during these times.</p>\r\n<h2>Let our content creators help!</h2>\r\n<p>Perhaps you do not have the in-house resources to create a steady stream of content for your blog and social media pages.
