Along with businesses, dental practices also experience these issues, striving for a plan. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help dental and other medical practices have a plan in place for opening their practice back up after the quarantine. With our guidance and services, we can help you start things with a strong foot forward for your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Recovering after a pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>When a dental or medical practice is dealing with hard times, the best option for the owner or manager is to stay calm and evaluate every possible opportunity. The following are potential points to consider.</p>\r\n<h3>Assess the condition of the practice</h3>\r\n<p>Perform a business appraisal and decide what needs to be done urgently. It is crucial to evaluate what a dental practice has and follow current updates with the COVID-19 pandemic. As the U.S. shifts to summer, more and more restrictions will begin to loosen. With that, people will begin returning to their normal routines. Our team can help dentists evaluate what they will need to reopen effectively.</p>\r\n<p>Now is the time to get creative and deal with the situation. The result of the appraisal will provide insights on whatever needs to be adjusted to get the business running.</p>\r\n<h3>Reach out to employees and customers</h3>\r\n<p>While some practices may be open for immediate health emergencies, not every practice can do that. In many cases, practices can reach out to any scheduled patient appointments to re-schedule appointments for a few months in the future. This includes letting them know the delays they might experience with certain services or is available.</p>\r\n<p>Employees need to know if their schedules will change and the nature of work they need to do. They need to know if the practice will be restricting hours or if they will need to work remotely for some time. Our team can help go over teledentistry, what it is, and how it can help practices reach patients at home during COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h3>Reinvent the business</h3>\r\n<p>In fact, it is easier for smaller businesses to modify their business models, switch focus, and get back into the game. Our team will help evaluate how to ensure dentists can effectively reach their patients while also offering advice on how to alter their practice methods during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Pay attention to what customers might need and would buy, and direct business operations toward that. Aside from considering immediate service demands, evaluate past sales for indications of increase, decline, or stagnancy. If sales were declining or stagnant, the downtime might be the time to think about necessary changes to make when the economy gains pace once more.</p>\r\n<h3>Non-equity cash raise</h3>\r\n<p>Seek to raise money from non-equity sources. Develop strategies to get government grants. Consider the SBA initiatives in place to help small businesses. Be inventive about getting sources of cash to stay in business, including making short-term deals that relieve the current crunch.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us to Learn More</h2>\r\n<p>Like virtually everything in life, the COVID-19 pandemic will pass. It is difficult to predict what the economy and the country will look like afterward, but if the company survives this, there are opportunities to grab. Stay alert and get ready to bounce back after the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Along with that, we can help clients reach patients in more ways than before with technology.</p>\r\n<p>We will take the time to work with you and determine what your practice is going to need going forward. As the months in quarantine continue, there is a gradual decrease in the number of restrictions. With that in mind, dental practices must have a plan in place for when that happens. We can help to set this system up.</p>\r\n<p>What applies to businesses can also apply to dental and medical practices. Here are some various opportunities in store for dental practices that take a proactive approach.</p>\r\n<h2>The Opportunities that lie ahead</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies are not sitting idly and watching the situation unfold. They have adapted to the current situation and expanded their business models, reordered their production lines, and focused on new needs. The summary is that they have observed the market trends and taken calculated risks, using COVID-19 as the rocket fuel for growth in some areas and resuscitating dormant potentials in others.</p>\r\n<p>Many establishments are moving online, digitizing most of their processes to increase the speed of executing projects and eliminating backlogs. In terms of productivity, there has been a significant rise in cloud services for work collaborations, solutions to reduce paperwork and physical contact, reimbursement apps and digital solutions for accounting, and the rise of contactless devices in several areas.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can help clients build an effective website and system that focuses on reaching patients. We will help to have a set plan in place for when the quarantine restrictions are lifted. The sooner dentists begin taking proactive steps toward the current situation, the sooner they can begin to prepare for success.</p>\r\n<h3>Business models</h3>\r\n<p>A prolonged crisis like this can force changes in customer profiles. Customers’ behavioral patterns are likely to change due to a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, many people will start ordering more regularly and receive door deliveries, even after the lockdown. Others will possibly increase online transactions. Businesses that pay attention to the customer profile changes can go on to build more efficient business models.</p>\r\n<h3>Remote work and service delivery</h3>\r\n<p>Renting an office space can be expensive, and remote work arrangement is yet to be adopted in the full functional scope. This will create opportunities in several and related sectors, including virtual classrooms, office space redesign, development of remote work platforms, online service provisions, software systems, and cloud-based services. All of these sectors will potentially witness drastic expansion when the world starts to recover from the pandemic, and employers look to reduce the cost of office space if their staff needs to work remotely.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us Today</h2>\r\n<p>The effects of the COVID-19 is under review by many experts, both in terms of medical and business implications.

These steps, when done correctly, can help you chart your way toward building a strong, healthy, and resilient practice following the quarantine.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a resilient business after a pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies are creating contingency plans as precautions against COVID-19. Some are implementing or adapting existing plans, while others have to develop new plans. The following are measures that companies can take to build a stronger and healthier business.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider the effect of coronavirus on customers</h3>\r\n<p>Depending on the industry, customers might be experiencing certain difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Business owners need to think strategically about the challenges that customers are facing and what can be done to help them. Using those facts, they can create a new sales pitch and structure their marketing plans to meet those challenges and needs.</p>\r\n<p>Regular business challenges typically worsen during a crisis. Business owners have the role of restructuring their product offerings to address the specific struggles faced by their customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Adopt new sales mediums</h3>\r\n<p>Despite the total lockdown, people will need to make purchases, providing opportunities to offer your products or services through alternative sales channels. For instance, if COVID-19 is halting customer visits to the company’s store, it is time to target and expand eCommerce channels. Business owners need to review their internet marketing efforts and e-commerce sales and see how they provide a boost.</p>\r\n<p>Focus more on conversations on social media and LinkedIn over physical sales meetings. Many B2B companies, especially those who deal with software or digital services and solutions, are already in this realm. The business continues, and more of it might need to go online.</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on long-term investments</h3>\r\n<p>The coronavirus disease situation might be the cue to make long-term investments in the business, especially those in B2B sales. If there is a momentary relapse in sales, then the time is right to reevaluate operations, processes, and existing platforms and get strategic for the long term. If there are major prospects in view, now is the time to dedicate more resources and effort into managing the leads and capitalizing on longer-term opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Monitor the leads, provide reassurances, and let everyone know that there are contingency plans in place and that they can access help when needed. This unparalleled situation is undoubtedly causing many cancellations like concert tickets, airline reservations, and business conferences. Still, high-ticket B2B sales may not suffer as much, unless the crisis continues for longer than anticipated, and companies start to reduce spending and investment.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us to Learn More Today</h2>\r\n<p>Economic recovery might happen earlier than expected. If you fail to position your business strategically, however, you may not be well-placed to build on post-pandemic recovery. Companies can take salient measures now to ensure that they come out of a major crisis like COVID-19 stronger and healthier.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
