Although remote work<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/the-new-normal-how-to-keep-your-teams-engaged-and-motivated/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>To protect employees from the outbreak of COVID-19, many companies have asked their staff to work from home. Although remote work is already somewhat common in many industries, many companies were not ready for the unexpected transition into an entirely remote workforce.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping work teams engaged and motivated</h2>\r\n<p>It is not enough to have the proper tech tools to keep the remote team working, but leadership also needs a strategy for maintaining efficient and motivated teams. Almost all families are now quarantined together in their houses, so employees have to deal with more distractions than usual. Also, they may be anxious about their safety and wellbeing, so employers need to pay attention to how their fears may affect productivity in the following weeks and months. To ensure smooth operations as the company navigates the “new normal,” below are expert insights on how to maintain engagement and motivation as the team works from home:</p>\r\n<h3>Communication is important</h3>\r\n<p>A fully remote team needs regular, clear communication to succeed. It is particularly crucial as the COVID-19 situation unfolds. Business owners need to devise different methods to communicate with their employees, including emails and chat software. Carefully prepared presentations can keep them going and provide necessary updates that affect the business at large. Chat channels are an efficient way to handle communication that once took place ad hoc, while video software can take the place of formal meetings.</p>\r\n<h3>Videos work too</h3>\r\n<p>Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts are easy-to-use video conferencing tools that ensure a regular meeting schedule. The key is to encourage every team member to switch on their cameras for face-to-face and necessary social interaction. Weekly meetings over video conferencing can keep everyone connected and prepared for work.</p>\r\n<h3>Exemplary leadership with proper remote work setup</h3>\r\n<p>If the team is not familiar with working from home, they may need time to adjust to their new home workspace. As the leader, having a proper remote work setup can serve as the model for the team, especially during video conferences. The work setup should be free of clutters and face a window for natural light. Noise-canceling headphones can help maintain focus on the necessary tasks.</p>\r\n<h3>Avoid micromanaging</h3>\r\n<p>Leaders might be tempted to monitor their employees constantly to ensure that they are staying on task as they work from home. However, micromanaging the team does not inspire trust, and a culture that revolves around trust is essential when keeping remote workers engaged and motivated. Since most of the work is now done remotely, leaders can achieve trust by avoiding micromanagement and staying transparent. Workers should be able to work autonomously.</p>\r\n<h3>Friendly interactions</h3>\r\n<p>Time often passes by quickly at home, and employees, removed from the social cues in the office, might be working without breaks. Managers can plan virtual breaks with team members between meetings to praise their accomplishments and foster healthy casual talk. Studies show, workers often perform better when they have a leader who cares about their wellbeing and creates time for fun and teambuilding.</p>\r\n<h2>Final note</h2>\r\n<p>These are challenging times, and employees are still trying to adjust to the COVID-19 crisis and their work. You can do your best as the business owner or manager to keep them motivated and engaged during the new normal.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

The content on a website can help to bring in potential patients through using keywords, SEO, and posting content regularly. At Doctor Genius, we can provide a steady flow of content to a client’s website, as well as managing the site as a whole. Therefore, as Google has just launched another core update, we are preparing for any changes that may come with its new algorithm.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within this new update, your website may experience changes in search results and the number of people who view your website. Here is what we know about the update and how we are here to help ensure the most effective search results for your practice’s website.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What We Know</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-may-2020-core-update-was-big-and-broad-search-data-tools-show-334393?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWW1GallqRmxNakZoWkdFdyIsInQiOiIrRWRcL2c0UklNT1orRUZkNnFyUjkwTDhqRzdXQmt0ZHZ1bUl6V2R1dklYSnhiWFJPdHNyZTlMOGo0VnRCRnBGWVNIRkFGOUVXRlZobDlibVRHd0pUN0JMaWtwczd4UlgrTTY0MGNGaVBZazczZDh1eDR3bTJETVdrMWlyY2tQZTIifQ%3D%3D\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Land</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this update went into effect on May 4th, 2020, and is one of the largest the internet has seen in a while. Core updates, as opposed to daily updates, tend to happen every few months and are not meant to be a method of restricting or limiting web traffic to certain pages. However, it can be challenging to completely map out what the changes are with the update and how they will affect your website. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It usually takes a few months before data analysts can determine the full effects of a core update. However, internal trends are usually reported within a few weeks. At this moment, Doctor Genius’ client base shows positive results for online traffic following the core update. Since the update began, </span><b>our clients have seen more than a 20%</b><b><i> increase</i></b><b> in organic page views and organic sessions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In other words, the recent uptick in our client’s online performance is likely due to Google’s May algorithm change. </span></p>\r\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How This May Effect Your Practice</span></i></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/08/core-updates.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Webmaster Central Blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> explains that the core update involves changes that “are about improving how our systems assess content overall,” further stating that “These changes may cause some pages that were previously under-rewarded to do better.” However, it can also cause certain pages to not receive as much traffic. In these instances, it helps to have a team that can further assess the situation and adapt to any changes.</span></p>\r\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You Can Do to Stay Ahead of Algorithm Changes</span></i></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to staying ahead of these Google algorithm changes, there are several possible steps one can take. The main area of focus should always be on the quality of content. While keywords can help certain pages rank in search results, the algorithm continues to change to better track spam or other pages that do not deliver quality content. Semrush.com quotes Google in saying that these </span><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/google-may-2020-core-update/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">core updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are “designed to ensure that overall, we’re delivering on our mission to present relevant and authoritative content to searchers.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can help create original content for your website with the purpose to both express the message you want to send and help target patient needs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our marketing and production teams are constantly reviewing content and help send the right message for each client. As we anticipate Google’s algorithm to constantly be updated to reward quality content, we work proactively to update our client’s pages with the information on the latest technology and answers to the new consumer needs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also work to improve on how we structure content to meet the needs of more users’ queries. In congruence with what experts say about SEO best practices, we constantly provide client&#8217;s new material because Google’s search values unique content. All of our efforts also adhere to the quality factors stated in Google’s Central Webmaster Blog:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing original information</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Containing a complete and comprehensive description of the topic</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring the title or headline of pages is descriptive of the topic</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the proper resources and citations</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping deliver a personalized and unique message</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Groups Who Were Most Affected by Search </span></i></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the major questions people have with each update is who benefits from this and who is taking a hit in the number of page views. Semrush.com explains that “the most influenced categories are Travel, Real Estate, Health, Pets &amp; Animals, and People &amp; Society.” Commonly known as the winners and losers of the update, it seems that websites focusing on news, business and industrial, online communication, and health experienced their own levels of increase in views.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semrush.com further explains that the entertainment websites promoting offline entertainment took the biggest hit and are on the losing side of the update. Since more people are remaining inside and most businesses have restrictions, it can be difficult to offer specific services. Medical practices are also experiencing limitations due to quarantine. However, an outcome of Covid-19 has been google favoring medical providers who offer virtual consultations. Additionally, we have personally seen an uptick in demand for dental services during the first months of the pandemic, as mentioned in our </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blueprint to recovery</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can help to adapt and tailor the content of your website to reflect both your practice services and the content that will attract more views. Especially following the COVID-19 pandemic and the quarantine regulations across the world, it is crucial for medical practices to have an effective online platform for reaching potential and current patients. For a website to help do this, there needs to be a regular flow of content to display activity.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach Patients with Your Message</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will take the time to understand your needs and desire for how you want to present your website to patients.

These changes are focused on helping enhance how Google measures the content of a page to determine where it ends up in search results lists. This update can have a positive or negative effect on search results for certain types of services and fields in the market.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>How Often Does Google Release Core Updates? </b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, the update can be every few months. The last update was in January of 2020. This update seems to be the largest update in a while as sources determine that it took around two weeks to finish updating.</span></p>\r\n<h3><b>What is E-A-T? </b></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-A-T stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness.

Social<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/what-does-social-distancing-mean-for-your-practice/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Social distancing is in full effect, and COVID-19 has made it more challenging for practices to maintain financial stability. Social distancing, however, does not mean that practices must close their doors entirely or discontinue marketing efforts. There are ways to stay in business during the COVID-19 pandemic and continue acquiring new patients. </p>\r\n<h2>The Importance of social distancing during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>As difficult as it might be for many practices, social distancing is an essential part of getting things back to normal. Ultimately, social distancing for COVID-19 is the best thing for practices because it may prevent the spread of the virus. This not only protects patients, but it also protects staff at your practice from exposure to COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>With that said, the pandemic does not mean your business has to discontinue all services and marketing efforts, but rather transition into a new way of treating patients and reaching those in need of your services.</p>\r\n<h2>What to expect during social distancing for COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has already caused many practices to only offer necessary or emergency services. This change makes it more challenging for all types of practices, especially those who primarily offer services not considered an emergency. Perhaps more notably, the pandemic has made healthcare and dental workers more vulnerable. Thus staff is required to take more precautions when dealing with patients. </p>\r\n<h2>Ways to stay in business while social distancing</h2>\r\n<p>While some practices that do not offer emergency services have closed their doors during the pandemic, others have altered the way they operate. With a little creativity, practices can continue helping their patients and find new ways to reach out to prospective patients nearby. </p>\r\n<h3>Offer emergency services</h3>\r\n<p>Many states have requested that medical and dental practices put a halt on most elective procedures but allow for emergency services and procedures that are necessary to continue. While social distancing may limit the services that your practice can offer, transitioning your marketing approach to target prospective patients who need essential and emergency services is a great way to continue acquiring new patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. </p>\r\n<h3>Put in place virtual visits</h3>\r\n<p>While virtual visits are not an option for all practices, many can stay in touch with their patients through virtual visits. These allow practices to discuss symptoms with the patient and help them determine if their need is considered an emergency. Staying in touch is not only a great way to treat the needs of patients while respecting social distancing, but it also helps ensure that the practice can keep their patients in the long term, after COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h2>Continue new patient acquisition with digital marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Practices can continue acquiring new patients while social distancing by altering the way they market. More people are using digital devices while they are at home social distancing, which makes for a great opportunity to increase digital marketing efforts.
