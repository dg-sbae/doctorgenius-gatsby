Social distancing, however, does not mean that practices must close their doors entirely or discontinue marketing efforts. There are ways to stay in business during the COVID-19 pandemic and continue acquiring new patients. </p>\r\n<h2>The Importance of social distancing during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>As difficult as it might be for many practices, social distancing is an essential part of getting things back to normal. Ultimately, social distancing for COVID-19 is the best thing for practices because it may prevent the spread of the virus. This not only protects patients, but it also protects staff at your practice from exposure to COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>With that said, the pandemic does not mean your business has to discontinue all services and marketing efforts, but rather transition into a new way of treating patients and reaching those in need of your services.</p>\r\n<h2>What to expect during social distancing for COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has already caused many practices to only offer necessary or emergency services. This change makes it more challenging for all types of practices, especially those who primarily offer services not considered an emergency. Perhaps more notably, the pandemic has made healthcare and dental workers more vulnerable. Thus staff is required to take more precautions when dealing with patients. </p>\r\n<h2>Ways to stay in business while social distancing</h2>\r\n<p>While some practices that do not offer emergency services have closed their doors during the pandemic, others have altered the way they operate. With a little creativity, practices can continue helping their patients and find new ways to reach out to prospective patients nearby. </p>\r\n<h3>Offer emergency services</h3>\r\n<p>Many states have requested that medical and dental practices put a halt on most elective procedures but allow for emergency services and procedures that are necessary to continue. While social distancing may limit the services that your practice can offer, transitioning your marketing approach to target prospective patients who need essential and emergency services is a great way to continue acquiring new patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. </p>\r\n<h3>Put in place virtual visits</h3>\r\n<p>While virtual visits are not an option for all practices, many can stay in touch with their patients through virtual visits. These allow practices to discuss symptoms with the patient and help them determine if their need is considered an emergency. Staying in touch is not only a great way to treat the needs of patients while respecting social distancing, but it also helps ensure that the practice can keep their patients in the long term, after COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h2>Continue new patient acquisition with digital marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Practices can continue acquiring new patients while social distancing by altering the way they market. More people are using digital devices while they are at home social distancing, which makes for a great opportunity to increase digital marketing efforts.

Although remote work<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/the-new-normal-how-to-keep-your-teams-engaged-and-motivated/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>To protect employees from the outbreak of COVID-19, many companies have asked their staff to work from home. Although remote work is already somewhat common in many industries, many companies were not ready for the unexpected transition into an entirely remote workforce.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping work teams engaged and motivated</h2>\r\n<p>It is not enough to have the proper tech tools to keep the remote team working, but leadership also needs a strategy for maintaining efficient and motivated teams. Almost all families are now quarantined together in their houses, so employees have to deal with more distractions than usual. Also, they may be anxious about their safety and wellbeing, so employers need to pay attention to how their fears may affect productivity in the following weeks and months. To ensure smooth operations as the company navigates the “new normal,” below are expert insights on how to maintain engagement and motivation as the team works from home:</p>\r\n<h3>Communication is important</h3>\r\n<p>A fully remote team needs regular, clear communication to succeed. It is particularly crucial as the COVID-19 situation unfolds. Business owners need to devise different methods to communicate with their employees, including emails and chat software. Carefully prepared presentations can keep them going and provide necessary updates that affect the business at large. Chat channels are an efficient way to handle communication that once took place ad hoc, while video software can take the place of formal meetings.</p>\r\n<h3>Videos work too</h3>\r\n<p>Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts are easy-to-use video conferencing tools that ensure a regular meeting schedule. The key is to encourage every team member to switch on their cameras for face-to-face and necessary social interaction. Weekly meetings over video conferencing can keep everyone connected and prepared for work.</p>\r\n<h3>Exemplary leadership with proper remote work setup</h3>\r\n<p>If the team is not familiar with working from home, they may need time to adjust to their new home workspace. As the leader, having a proper remote work setup can serve as the model for the team, especially during video conferences. The work setup should be free of clutters and face a window for natural light. Noise-canceling headphones can help maintain focus on the necessary tasks.</p>\r\n<h3>Avoid micromanaging</h3>\r\n<p>Leaders might be tempted to monitor their employees constantly to ensure that they are staying on task as they work from home. However, micromanaging the team does not inspire trust, and a culture that revolves around trust is essential when keeping remote workers engaged and motivated. Since most of the work is now done remotely, leaders can achieve trust by avoiding micromanagement and staying transparent. Workers should be able to work autonomously.</p>\r\n<h3>Friendly interactions</h3>\r\n<p>Time often passes by quickly at home, and employees, removed from the social cues in the office, might be working without breaks. Managers can plan virtual breaks with team members between meetings to praise their accomplishments and foster healthy casual talk. Studies show, workers often perform better when they have a leader who cares about their wellbeing and creates time for fun and teambuilding.</p>\r\n<h2>Final note</h2>\r\n<p>These are challenging times, and employees are still trying to adjust to the COVID-19 crisis and their work. You can do your best as the business owner or manager to keep them motivated and engaged during the new normal.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Dentists have a high<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The COVID-19 global pandemic has affected many industries all over the world, including the dental industry. Dentists have a high risk of being infected due to their proximity to their patients while performing treatments.</p>\r\n<h2>How COVID-19 is changing the dental market</h2>\r\n<p>The outbreak of the coronavirus has left many business owners wondering how they will take care of their expenses. Dental clinics fall under this umbrella because many are small businesses run by a single owner.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/infectious-diseases-2019-novel-coronavirus?utm_source=adaorg&amp;utm_medium=VanityURL\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/infectious-diseases-2019-novel-coronavirus?utm_source=adaorg&amp;utm_medium=VanityURL\">American Dental Association</a> has recommended that dentists only offer emergency services to their patients as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow. Many dentists are following the recommendations of the ADA and cutting back on their hours of operation. Some clinics are even shutting down completely in the midst of all of the uncertainty. Dental clinics are also highly impacted by the scarcity of essential items like face masks, which help protect dentists and their patients.</p>\r\n<p>Dentists will have to look for creative ways to help their patients and keep their businesses running while trying to practice social distancing. Some dentists are now using their websites and phone lines to help their patients. Patients are screened over the phone to understand the nature of their problem, and the dentist can give them advice on how to proceed. Patients with issues that require emergency dental treatment are asked to come to the clinic. Screening patients helps limit the number of people at the clinic at any given time, which makes it a safer environment for everyone.</p>\r\n<h2>The Importance of providing emergency dental treatments</h2>\r\n<p>Dentists have a responsibility to treat patients with dental emergencies because failing to do so would leave emergency rooms — many of which are already at their max capacities due to the pandemic — with an additional burden to take care of. The White House agrees with the ADA&#8217;s recommendations in terms of advising the population to delay elective dental or medical treatments while COVID-19 remains an issue.</p>\r\n<h3>Increasing hygiene practices</h3>\r\n<p>Dentists also have a responsibility to protect themselves and their patients during this outbreak. Social distancing should be practiced in waiting rooms with patients sitting six feet apart from each other. This should be easier to manage if only patients with dental emergencies are allowed in the clinic.</p>\r\n<p>Tele-dentistry companies will likely emerge as winners during this pandemic because people with non-essential dental needs are now more likely than ever to try such services. Brick-and-mortar dentist offices should also start developing ways to perform non-essential treatments without a need for patients to come to the clinic.</p>\r\n<h2>Help is available for the dental industry</h2>\r\n<p>The U.S. government has passed a $2-trillion stimulus that aims to provide some relief to businesses that have been hit hard by the coronavirus. Programs that dental clinics qualify for include:</p>\r\n<p>Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL): These loans are being provided on a first-come, first-serve basis. It provides an emergency grant of up to $10,000 that must be used to pay overhead expenses, employee wages, or rent/mortgage.</p>\r\n<p>Paycheck Protection program: This can give small businesses up to 2.5 times their monthly payroll to keep them afloat.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
