In June of 2017, Facebook reached 2 billion monthly users. Medical professionals who do not utilize social media are missing out on the chance to reach a greater number of patients in the digital landscape. However, professional social media accounts require constant management.\r\n\r\n<h3>The key to effective social media marketing</h3>\r\n\r\nWhile adults will seek out information about dentistry or other medical practice, it is no surprise that younger audiences will not. It is important to know how to use social media to reach your target audience. Having multiple accounts on social media platforms is crucial for medical professionals to reach people of various demographics and backgrounds.\r\n\r\nAfter all, HubSpot found that in 2017, 74 percent of people say they use Facebook for professional reasons. Keeping up multiple social media accounts from Facebook to Yelp, can become difficult with a busy schedule.\r\n\r\nHowever, the key to effective social media marketing is efficient social media management. For instance, a post about proper brushing techniques can contain hyperlinks that take the individual back to your website with more information.\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col m7\">\r\n<blockquote>Facebook, by far, sends a greater volume of readers to both short-form and long-form news. Overall, about eight-in ten user complete interactions with a news article via a social networking site come from Facebook (82% long-form and 84% short-form), while a much smaller portion come from Twitter (16% long-form and 14% short-form). –Pew Research Center, 2016</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col m5\"><img class=\"wp-image-673\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2.jpg 378w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2-300x294.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2-177x174.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>\r\n</div>\r\nYou can have your target demographic reading more content on your website through the proper social media posts. At Doctor Genius, we know how to help reach out to the target audience that will respond best to your content.\r\n\r\n<h3>Keeping up constant posts</h3>\r\n\r\nSocial media accounts that do not keep up consistent posts will find fewer followers and views on their profiles. If you do not have someone to keep an active account, then it is less likely to drive traffic. Thus, having a company that specializes in social media management and marketing to help keep the updates going is a great benefit for your practice.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we will help clients by updating multiple accounts with active content to help them to reach more potential patients. With our services, we can help direct patients from social media to the active content on your website on top of multiple service pages. We will help customize the website to your requests while also ensuring effective content.\r\n\r\nBy seeking the services at Doctor Genius, you can focus on your practice and we can take care of your digital presence online.

Similar to the Beatles, many people feel their independence vanish in the haze with this latest update. A requirement that will force people to use HTTPS on Google Chrome leads to a complicated transition for many websites and companies.\r\n\r\n<h3>Heed the warnings</h3>\r\n\r\nIt is important to heed the warning Google sends out now since October 2017 is the month in which they will enact this change. While some people may wonder how big of an impact this will be, “I mean, how many people use the Google Chrome browser anyways?” As of November 2016, Google announced that there were over 2 billion active Chrome Browsers.\r\n\r\nWith so many people relying on the Chrome browser for a variety of reasons from searching for an answer to settle a debate to searching for a dentist in the local area, seeing “Not Secure” anywhere on the page will definitely push people away from clicking on the website. Any HTTP website will not be able to remove this warning unless the website upgrades to HTTPS.\r\n\r\nAnother reason professionals need to pay attention to this change is that Google will rank an HTTP or “Not Secure” website lower on the list than a HTTPS website. With ranking being on the line, professionals who have a website or are considering a website need to ensure their website is ready for the change. One way to ensure that everything works with the transition and does not decrease ranking is by seeking a professional service that has the tools and skill to keep up with the times.\r\n\r\n<h3>Don’t get left in the dust</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-700\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\"> The “S” in HTTPS is part of SSL, Secure Sockets Layer, and is the standard security technology to establish an encrypted link between a web server and browser, ensuring that all data between them remains private.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDoctor Genius does not just provide clients with a website that acts as an effective digital platform to reach potential patients, but we keep up with all of the changes Google throws our way. Medical professionals will find that building a fully-functional website is only the first step. A website needs constant maintenance and updates to rank high on search results.\r\n\r\nEspecially with this newest change from Google, professionals need a service that has the knowledge to solve or effectively work around these issues.

In 2015, Google found that 51 percent of smartphone users discovered a new company or product when conducting a search on a smartphone. Similar to how commercials on TV are still relevant to promoting products, having an easily accessible website that works on mobile devices is crucial for any successful practice.\r\n\r\n<h3>Easy access</h3>\r\n\r\nWith the invention of smartphones, society began to rely on these devices for more than a few apps and phone calls. Google also found that in 2015, more Google searches took place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan. A professional practice will greatly benefit from a website that is mobile-first.\r\n\r\nMany people may browse potential dentists or doctors in their local area by searching on their smartphone while watching TV at home. Regardless, mobile searches are a crucial aspect of how potential patients determine which practice they will choose. A website that takes too long to load or is too complex to use will only motivate the patient to search other practices. Also, Google will not rank a website that takes too long to load. Thus, it is crucial to have a mobile first website.\r\n\r\nA mobile first website means that when people search the website on their smartphone or tablet devices with a smaller screen than a computer, the website is responsive or will load proportionately to the screen. At Doctor Genius, our clients can rest easy knowing that we pride ourselves on building mobile first websites to help bring in potential patients.\r\n\r\n<h3>All the necessary information on the go</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-685\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Google also found that in 2015, more Google searches took place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhile cell phones of the past were a technological revolution for providing call services from virtually anywhere without a cord, smartphones are famous for being able to access thousands of search results anytime anywhere. With today’s smartphone, people can have equal or more computing power to a desktop computer.\r\n\r\nProfessionals need to ensure that their website has all of the necessary information readily available and easy to access on any device. If a potential patient looks at a client’s website on a smartphone and finds that the page does not work or load properly, they will probably dismiss it.\r\n\r\nThus, Doctor Genius will set up a mobile first website that works on multiple devices and stands out in the digital market.
