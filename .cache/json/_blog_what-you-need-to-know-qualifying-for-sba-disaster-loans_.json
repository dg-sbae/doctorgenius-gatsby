The Small Business Association has several options and recommendations on how to proceed. This blog will cover what you need to know about what the SBA loan is and how the process works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on this topic or to apply for an SBA loan, visit <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance\" target=\"blank\">sba.gov</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Current SItuation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times reports on March 29, 2020, President Trump stated that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html\" target=\"_blank\">social distancing guidelines from the federal government would last until April 30.</a> While the quarantine on what businesses can or cannot open is a decision of the state’s government, small businesses need a more lucrative solution than waiting around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the number of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed cases in the US reaching 163, 539 as of March 31, 2020, </a> and expected to continue climbing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, it is crucial for businesses to develop a plan. Business owners may not even realize that they do not need to experience a disaster to qualify for an SBA disaster loan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Understanding What an SBA Disaster Loan Is</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The SBA explains on their website that, “The SBA offers disaster assistance in the form of low-interest loans to businesses, renters, and homeowners located in regions affected by declared disasters.&#8221; A major concern for small and large businesses across the country involves being able to pay bills along with employees’ payroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By filing for a <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/EIDL_Information_and_Documentation_-_3-23-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SBA disaster loan</a>, you can use it to:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Pay fixed debt payments</li>\r\n<li>Cover payroll</li>\r\n<li>Cover accounts payable</li>\r\n<li>Pay bills</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are certain stipulations and requirements a company needs to meet for an SBA disaster loan, the loan can cover a max of $2 million for economic injury. This way, businesses can support their employees and their company’s infrastructure during this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Qualifying for a Loan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to qualifying for an SBA disaster loan, SBA.gov states that any business with less than 500 employees in the United States that cannot pay bills due to COVID-19. With most companies and industries on hold, much of the economy’s flow is stopped. This ripple effect is causing a variety of issues for various businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases, the interest rate for a small business will be 3.75% and 2.75% for small businesses. The eligibility for the exact amount of this loan will depend on the size and type of resources. The SBA will also take any financial resources the business has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Applying for The Loan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is possible to fill out a paper form and apply in person, it is faster and recommended by the SBA to apply online at their website. After applying for the loan, you can print it out to keep a copy for yourself. In most cases, it can take anywhere from two to three weeks with a disbursement of $225,000 available within five days of approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need immediate assistance or funds, you can request an emergency advance within three days of receiving the application to the amount of $10,000. The sooner people act and apply for this loan, the more likely they will be able to have the necessary funds for themselves, their business, and their employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Included Loan Forgiveness</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another factor to consider when applying for a loan is the possibility of loan forgiveness. With an SBA disaster loan, there is partial loan forgiveness. Loan forgiveness may be possible with issues involving payroll costs, interest payments on a mortgage, along with rent payments for a lease that was in effect prior to February 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there are limits to the amount of forgiveness for the loan. During the application process, you can request assistance from SBA. Our team can also help provide guidance when necessary.  The SBA also will go into detail about the loan and the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Professional Guidance from Our Team</h3>\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, our team works with finance and lending experts who can help you understand this process.

If you<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-set-up-virtual-visits-with-patients/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Setting up virtual visits can be the solution you need to continue seeing patients during the COVID-19 crisis. If you are using telemedicine for the first time, you likely have a few questions. Find out how Doctor Genius can help you set up virtual visits by contacting us at (877) 477-2311.</p>\r\n<p>To help you understand the importance of telemedicine, we will go through the steps for getting started. Below are a few tips on scheduling virtual appointments while we get through this pandemic together.</p>\r\n<h2>Using telemedicine during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Right now, the federal government has relaxed rules regarding HIPAA compliance and telemedicine. Still, providers are encouraged to choose a HIPAA-compliant vendor. First, providers can check with their current EHR vendor to see if it has telemedicine functionality.</p>\r\n<p>For our clients, we now offer a TeleDentistry service. If you work in the dental space, contact our office to discuss setting up this service for your practice. Doctor Genius&#8217; option works as an extension to your site&#8217;s interface, allowing patients to connect directly from your website to you.  </p>\r\n<h3>Get the proper technology</h3>\r\n<p>Once practices select software, it is time to consider equipment. Providers need a high-quality webcam and microphone to offer the service. Most computers have both, but many providers choose to purchase standalone equipment. The right equipment improves the quality of video appointments.</p>\r\n<p>Providers also need a fast internet connection. At a minimum, 5 Mbps upload and 15 Mbps download speeds are required. Providers should check the internet speed by running a speed test. It is easy to conduct a speed test online. Those who use Wi-Fi can speed up the connection by plugging the internet directly into the computer through an ethernet cable.</p>\r\n<h3>Choose a dedicated space</h3>\r\n<p>Patients want virtual visits to mimic in-person visits. That means they expect to have the provider’s full attention during telemedicine appointments. Providers should set up a dedicated space for these visits. After selecting a space for the appointments, providers should check the lighting, ensuring that it is bright but does not cause any glare. It is also wise to check for echoes and noise when selecting a room for these visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Test the equipment</h3>\r\n<p>Providers should not conduct telemedicine visits until they test the equipment. Testing is as simple as having a video chat with another provider. The provider can check the sound and video quality, paying special attention to latency. If the video takes time to buffer, it will be difficult to conduct a telemedicine appointment.</p>\r\n<h3>Inform the patient of technical needs</h3>\r\n<p>Many patients have yet to undergo a telemedicine appointment. Providers should explain what is necessary for these appointments, including access to video chat. Ask the patients to sit in a quiet, private room during the appointment. Some will prefer scheduling appointments when no one else is home, so providers should mention that.</p>\r\n<h3>Contact the patient</h3>\r\n<p>After scheduling a telemedicine appointment, the provider needs to contact the patient with a link. This can be done through an online portal or via text message if the patient has opted in to receive SMS messages. The patient is directed to a virtual waiting room after clicking on the link. Then, when the provider is ready, the appointment begins.</p>\r\n<h2>Get started with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Telemedicine makes it much easier for providers to see patients during this health crisis. If you have yet to use this, consider adding telemedicine software. By providing your patients with this option, you can continue to see your patients during this difficult time. This will allow you to limit your in-person visits while still caring for your patients.</p>\r\n<p>With quarantine continuing to be in effect throughout the country, telemedicine and other techniques like it are becoming the solution that medical practices need to continue providing professional care.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Many are struggling<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/financing-options-now-available-resulting-from-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"\r\n<p>As the world navigates the effects of COVID-19, people are grappling with a variety of new challenges. Many are struggling to cope with the potential physical, mental, sociological, security, and logistical changes that the quarantine causes. Additionally, many businesses and individuals alike are feeling mounting financial pressure.</p>\r\n<p>Many homeowners and renters are worried that they may not be able to handle their financial obligations due to increasing layoffs, a drop in working hours, or missing work for health reasons. Drops in operating hours and complete business shutdowns have owners concerned as to how they will be able to pay their workers, keep their businesses afloat, and afford personal expenses. </p>\r\n<p>Although the future may appear uncertain for many, there are some potential options that can help people weather the storm.</p>\r\n<h2>Loan and Rent Deferment</h2>\r\n<p>The continuing issue of COVID-19 has led to shutdowns of large portions of the economy. As a result, many have seen a significant decrease in their working hours, and some have experienced layoffs. Consequently, workers and business owners alike are encountering pay and revenue cuts. Businesses and their workers are scrambling to manage their finances, including making payments on their loans and rent.</p>\r\n<h3>Loan Deferment</h3>\r\n<p>One of the options that may be available to those in this situation is a loan deferment. A <a href= \"https://www.debt.org/students/forbearance-deferment/\"  target=\"_blank\">loan deferment</a> is a set amount of time where the borrower or renter does not have to make principal payments to the lender or landlord. The borrower will typically apply for a deferment when circumstances like unemployment, school, and military obligations render them unable to make their payments.</p>\r\n<p>A deferment is typically negotiated in advance between the two parties, and one of the first steps includes the renter providing a viable reason as to why they need the delay. Depending on the terms of the deferment, the landlord may also waive the interest payments for the borrower or renter during the deferment period. On March 13, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2020/fil20017.html\" target=\"_blank\">began encouraging financial institutions</a> to implement policies which will assist customers and communities affected by COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the FDIC has provided <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/coronavirus/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">a page on their website</a> as a resource for both banks and their customers. In following these guidelines, major banks like Citibank and Bank of America have offered a variety of relief options to their customers. Some of them have aided small businesses, consumers, mortgage borrowers, auto borrowers, and more through deferment options and refunds on late fees. Customers should contact their lenders to see if they offer special COVID-19 deferment.</p>\r\n<h3>Rent Deferment</h3>\r\n<p>With hours decreasing and businesses shutting down, business owners and individuals alike are wondering how they will be able to make rent payments. Renters fear that missing these payments will potentially result in mounting bills and even eviction. Additionally, landlords often rely on rent payments to finance the mortgage on their properties, or for their incomes in general. Unfortunately, many renters and tenants have not planned for incidents like these, and as a result, it puts both parties in a tough position.</p>\r\n<p>Landlords and their tenants must work together to establish a plan or agreement which will mitigate losses for both parties during this time. Larger property management groups are more likely to be able to cope with missed rent payments. Unfortunately, most individual renters will be less likely to afford a rent deferment. If smaller renters are totally unable to provide a deferment, they may be able to grant their tenants a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grace_period.asp\" target=\"_blank\">grace period</a> on their monthly rent dues.</p>\r\n<p>However, due to the evolving nature of the situation, it is currently impossible to say how long an appropriate time frame for a deferment or grace period should be. Deferment periods vary, but landlords usually defer payments for 90 days. It is not uncommon for landlords to allow tenants to add the missed payment(s) on to the end of their lease to be paid at its expiration, while others set up systems for tenants to pay off deferred rent incrementally. Nevertheless, tenants should strive to pay their rent on time until they can reach an agreement with their renters. Each renter will differ in their offerings, so tenants must contact them and ask about any available payment options.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Government Assistance</h2>\r\n<p>On March 18, the federal government enacted <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818322136/heres-what-is-in-the-families-first-coronavirus-aid-package-trump-approved\" target=\"_blank\">The Families First Coronavirus Aid Package</a>. The package includes benefits like paid sick leave, free virus testing for uninsured individuals, unemployment assistance, general Medicaid funding, and food aid. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has put a <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_20_042\" target=\"_blank\">sixty-day moratorium</a> on evictions and foreclosures for single-family homeowners. To qualify, they must have mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Additionally, mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will suspend evictions and foreclosures for at least 60 days.</p>\r\n<p><a href= \"https://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/state-fiscal-responses-to-covid-19.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Some state and local governments</a> have signed financial aid packages into effect that aim to help individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19. Many of these include mandates that assist tenants during this time, a time in which many are unable to pay their rent. For example, California has placed a temporary moratorium on evictions and mandated that essential utilities remain on, regardless of payment from the tenant. Additionally, New York implemented a ninety-day mandate protecting commercial and residential tenants.</p>\r\n<p>On Sunday, Oregon rolled out an order temporarily barring landlords for evicting renters for nonpayment, and Utah will soon offer deferment plans for tenants in the state. Local governments like Seattle and Miami-Dade have also taken similar action via the court system. As time passes, more state and local governments are adopting laws that assist businesses and residents. Although some of the state and local measures are barring evictions and foreclosures, but are still requiring rent and mortgage payments, they may change with the evolution of the overall COVID-19 situation in the U.S.</p>\r\n<h2>Small Business Association Assistance</h2>\r\n<p>The Small Business Association (SBA) has published its <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources\" target=\"_blank\">options and resources</a> which aim to assist small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This comes as the White House implemented the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/the-u-s-response-to-coronavirus-summary-of-the-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-supplemental-appropriations-act-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act</a>, which included an allocation of $20 million to the SBA.</p> \r\n<p>To keep loan repayments affordable, the SBA provides products with long-term repayments, up to a maximum of 30 years. Terms are determined on a business’s particular situation and based upon each borrower’s ability to repay. These Economic Injury Disaster Loans are one component of the federal government’s comprehensive response to COVID-19. Although the SBA’s programs are only one part of a comprehensive effort by the federal government, that part can be critically useful to small businesses and their workers in the current economic climate.</p>\r\n<h3>SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program</h3>\r\n<p>The first of these offerings is the <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/disaster-assistance/coronavirus-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\">SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program</a>. This program is the SBA’s new addition to its disaster assistance program. The offering provides low-interest working capital loans up to $2 million for businesses and nonprofits affected by COVID-19. These loans have an interest rate of 3.75% for small businesses and 2.75% for nonprofit organizations.</p>\r\n<p>A governor must request access to this program for businesses in their state to be eligible. Additionally, a state must be considered a disaster area by the SBA or President. The SBA’s website states that “Small business owners in all U.S. states and territories are currently eligible to apply for a low-interest loan due to Coronavirus (COVID-19).” Those who are interested can <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance\" target=\"_blank\">apply here</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional SBA Products</h3>\r\n<p>The SBA offers a variety of financing options during this time to help support small business operations. Businesses can access capital through programs including 7(a), Express, Community Advantage, 504, and Microloan. The SBA also offers exporting assistance, which can assist small businesses that directly or indirectly export, but face challenges with COVID-19. These programs include Export Express, Export Working Capital, and Export Trade.</p>\r\n<p>A 7(a) program is an all-inclusive option that provides loan amounts up to $5,000,000. Small businesses can use it for working capital, expansion, renovation, new construction, and more. An Express loan provides loans up to $350,000 for less than seven years. These are used for many of the same purposes as the 7(a) loan. A Community Advantage loan program allows lenders to help small businesses in underserved markets with a maximum loan size of $250,000.</p>\r\n<p>The eligible uses for these loans are the same as the 7(a) program. A 504 loan program aims to facilitate economic development, job creation, and job retention. These loans are limited to the acquisition, or eligible refinance, of fixed assets. Finally, a Microloan program makes loans through nonprofit lending organizations to underserved markets. These are authorized to use for working capital, supplies, machinery, equipment, and fixtures. However, a borrower can not use it for real estate. The maximum loan amount is $50,000.</p>\r\n<h3>Deferring SBA Loans</h3>\r\n<p>On March 10, the SBA sent out a <a href= \"https://www.sba.gov/document/information-notice-5000-20004-deferments-sba-7a-504-business-loans-microloans\" target=\" _blank\">notice</a> which stated that 7(a) Lenders, 504 program Certified Development Companies (CDCs), and Microloan Intermediaries should work with existing borrowers experiencing cash flow issues as a result of the current economy. As long as a 7(a) loan has not yet sold on the secondary market, a lender may grant the borrower a deferment for six months. If a loan sells on the secondary market, then the lender may grant a one-time unilateral deferment for up to 90 days without consent from the investor (investor may be notified after the fact). However, investors must give their consent before any future deferments on the same loan. A CDC may defer either six payments on a loan or 20% of the original loan amount (whichever is a lower amount).</p>\r\n<p>No matter how small the amount, the SBA encourages at least some payment from the borrower during the deferment period. This shows that the payment source and method are the same, and also encourages the borrower to maintain a routine of consistent payment. With SBA loans, interest accumulates during the deferment period. Interest can be paid during deferment, in a lump sum at the end, or an increase in the loan after the deferment period.</p>\r\n<p>Loan deferments are a temporary solution, so businesses should have a detailed plan and optimized payment strategy in place when requesting a deferral. SBA regulations require lenders to assess a borrower’s financial information under prudent lending standards case-by-case to determine if the borrower’s cash flow problems are short-term or permanent. SBA lenders may issue borrowers a deferral request form, which requires the borrower to outline the reason for their deferral. Additionally, it will ask borrowers to specify the steps taken to lessen cash flow issues, address any cash flow issues not resulting from COVID-19, and provide their most recent financial information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COVID-19 has had quite an impact on the economy and has presented a variety of fiscal challenges for both businesses and individuals. However, assistance options continue to emerge from both the private and public sectors. As things continue to develop, it is critical to stay informed and utilize any programs that may be helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
