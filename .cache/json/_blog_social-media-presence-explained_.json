There is a good chance that your targeted audience may first interact with your brand on a social media platform before ever encountering your website. Having a strong strategy will allow you to build brand awareness, create good organic posts, and convert qualified leads.</p>\r\n<h2>Setting up Your Social Media Accounts for Success</h2>\r\n<p>Now is a great time to get started if your business does not have any social media accounts yet. Take time to evaluate which platforms may be the most beneficial for your company, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>\r\n<h3>Understand the Different Social Platforms</h3>\r\n<p>Having a general understanding of the various social platforms, the type of content, and the audience they attract can help you set up your accounts effectively. For example, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/\">Instagram statistics</a> show the site is most popular among younger adults aged 18 to 34. On the other hand. LinkedIn&#8217;s primary users are between the ages of 46 and 55 years old.</p>\r\n<h3>Create a Brand Identity</h3>\r\n<p>Your office branding should be consistent everywhere people may interact with it. If your company has designed a logo, this image should appear on your signs, marketing collateral, company website, and social media platforms.</p>\r\n<h3>Identify Your Goals</h3>\r\n<p>Run the numbers to evaluate where your company currently is at versus where you need it to be. If your office is already active on social media, identify which areas you need to improve on and focus on those.  Investing in building brand awareness is important to do before directing your efforts towards lead generation and conversions.</p>\r\n<h3>Balance Paid and Organic Content</h3>\r\n<p>When using social media, businesses have two main tools to reach people and direct them towards a specific action: paid advertisements and organic content. Your office does not have to have a large following to reach your intended audience, as most sites do not post your ads on your account. Using paid ads can help you get page likes and present your brand to people who fit your target demographic.</p>\r\n<p>Organic content includes posts on your page. Keep up on posting and engage with your audience to establish your brand and draw potential patients to your office. When done correctly, this can help boost your website’s SEO ranking by encouraging backlinking to highly shared content and increasing the number of branded searches on search engines from people who interact with your office on social media.</p>\r\n<p>Build Brand Awareness and Boost SEO With Social Media</p>\r\n<p>In today’s digital world, social media is a necessary aspect of a business.

It differs from traditional SEO in that you do not optimize your website for these key terms but rather optimize the authoritative site for them. Here is why you would want to do this.</p>\r\n<h2>The Concept Behind Barnacle SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Barnacle SEO is a term to describe a relationship similar to one that occurs in the natural world. In nature, barnacles will attach themselves to a moving object, such as a whale, so that they may drift along with the whale through the current and catch whatever nutrients come by. In turn, the barnacles provide the whale with something akin to a suit of armor. This concept works the same regarding big and small websites.</p>\r\n<h3>Using Other Sites To Improving Ranking</h3>\r\n<p>On its own, a small website has little to no chance of ranking for the industry’s most competitive key terms. It would be a significant drain on one&#8217;s resources to try to. Fortunately, sites are available that easily rank for those keywords that one can attach their brand’s name to benefit from their authority. Two of the biggest “whales,” so to speak, are Google and Yelp. However, there are other useful sites to which a brand can attach their name to. Some of these sites can serve a practice better than Google or Yelp. For instance, health practitioners may also want to <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/using-doctor-ratings-sites#1\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/using-doctor-ratings-sites#1\">look into niche sites</a> like Vitals and Healthgrades.</p>\r\n<h3>A Google Business Profile</h3>\r\n<p>A Google Business Profile is vital for SEO since it helps gain search engine visibility and gives businesses a better chance of appearing in local Google Search results and Google Maps. A Google My Business account allows one to claim ownership of their Business Profile and make changes to it. Making changes and updating information to ensure it is accurate creates an optimized profile that helps it rank for local and competitive keywords.</p>\r\n<h3>Yelp Matters</h3>\r\n<p>As the largest local review site next to Google+ Local, Yelp matters a lot. Yelp pages often show up at the top of Google for even generic terms like doctor, dentist, and chiropractor. Yelp results also feature ratings, which heavily influence conversions. The site also influences Google and Bing behind the scenes, meaning that a strong Yelp profile with many reviews can cause either of the search engines to show a profile before others.</p>\r\n<h2>Supporting Your Barnacle SEO Efforts</h2>\r\n<p>Google and Yelp<a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\"> can support your barnacle SEO efforts</a> in unique ways. Google can boost your local SEO, while Yelp can influence search engines and consumers. Our SEO professionals at Doctor Genius can help you build up your profiles on both sites. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Call us</a> if you are interested in learning more about how we can serve your digital marketing needs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

This type of employee wants to be highly thought of and produce quality work. Intrinsic motivators can be some of the most compelling reasons why individuals choose to work in the medical field. Let&#8217;s examine ways to take advantage of intrinsic motivation in a medical office.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Get rid of preconceived ideas about motivation</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.tutor2u.net/business/reference/motivation-pink-three-elements-of-intrinsic-motivation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Daniel Pink</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, a well-known author and speaker about motivation, the common tendency is to think of motivation as either based on fear or excitement. Many people are motivated by the fear of failure, disappointing others, or punishment. As well, just about everyone appears to work harder when excited by the promise of a reward, either in the form of a compliment or a bonus. While these things may be true, though, they are not necessarily the primary reasons for people&#8217;s actions. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Discover what truly motivates your staff members</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When office management is aware of the primary reasons employees are motivated, managers can both help staff members to thrive and encourage them to be more productive. This in turn can enhance the patient experience. Here are three main intrinsic motivators to consider.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The ability to self-manage</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This can be a struggle for many management teams, because the traditional office system requires employees to comply with orders and dutifully complete tasks without question. However, allowing staff members to self-direct can be an excellent way to get them more engaged in their work. It can also open the door for them to present thoughts or ideas related to the job and the improvement of related processes or programs. It is critical to find a balance between assigning tasks and allowing employees to suggest them. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The desire for self-improvement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Progress and personal achievement can be incredible motivators. When people improve because they want to rather than because they are told to, the results come much faster and last much longer. The trick with implementing this type of motivator is to assign tasks that are not too difficult but go beyond the basics of what is commonly performed by the employee. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The desire to connect with a bigger cause</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most people want to do things that make a difference or leave a lasting impression. Menial tasks tend to be a disincentive or deterrence to job satisfaction. Because the bulk of an employee&#8217;s daytime hours are typically spent at work, it can be much more motivating when that work matters in a meaningful way. A key way to introduce this in a medical office is to </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/communicate-new-mission-vision-30929.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">clearly communicate</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> the goals, values, and mission of the company. Understanding how their role within the office matters can allow employees to feel they are contributing to the greater good. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Motivate your office</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tapping into the intrinsic motivators of your medical office staff can help employees get more enjoyment out of their jobs, increase productivity, and even improve the patient experience. At Doctor Genius, we understand how critical it is to care for both patients and staff members.
