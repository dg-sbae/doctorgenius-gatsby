Reaching your audience,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-connect-to-an-audience-through-social-media/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>It can be difficult to effectively manage your practice&#8217;s social media accounts while taking care of patients. Reaching your audience, building relationships, and creating a good first impression online requires more than just posting an advertisement. Interactive marketing relies on communication and relevancy to make an impact. Here are some tips to boost your online presence and connect with your audience through social media organically.</p>\r\n<h2>Variety and Frequency of Social Media Communication</h2>\r\n<p>Regardless of the social media platforms used, there is a sweet spot for how many times to post. However, there is no hard and fast rule for how often a business should post. It is also essential to create engaging and informative content to get the audience interested in learning more.</p>\r\n<h3>Tailor Each Platform</h3>\r\n<p>It may be appropriate to post on some platforms daily, while others may only require posting a few days a week. Sticking to approximately one post per day is ideal for most social media platforms. This practice is especially true for Facebook and Instagram, where posting one to two times a day is acceptable for most businesses. Posting less than this may cause prospective patients to lose interest, while posting more can overwhelm or even annoy leads. Consistency is key for both platforms.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding Twitter, there is much more flexibility in how frequently to post, as there is often a shorter window for businesses to reach clients just after tweeting. Some businesses can post as many as five times a day with good results. Posting once a day during the workweek on LinkedIn is ideal as business professionals, and older adults primarily use it.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Forms of Engagement</h3>\r\n<p>While there is a limit on how often to post on social media accounts, there is no limit to online engagement with prospective and current clients. If someone interacts with a platform through a comment or question, the business should <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-social-media-active/\">try to respond immediately</a>. The sooner the response, the better the chances are of meeting their needs and establishing a relationship.</p>\r\n<p>It can be challenging to keep track of social media communication, so turning on notifications for accounts or assigning an individual to manage the social media page can help one remain consistent. If responding right away is not possible, try to answer at least by the end of the day. Social media interaction with clients is now more important than ever. <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service\">Research</a> has found that 33% of customers prefer to contact companies through social media rather than the phone and that 77% of U.S. online adults say that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide good service.</p>\r\n<h3>Developing a Strategy</h3>\r\n<p>The first step to delivering great content is to design a social media strategy. This plan should identify marketing goals and the target audience. There are many different approaches to social media marketing that a business may take. Still, there are common goals like building brand awareness, growing page likes, generating leads, and increasing website visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Developing Goals</h3>\r\n<p>The first marketing campaign for recently established businesses or ones new to social media should build the target audience&#8217;s awareness. Businesses will often use paid advertisements geared toward a specific demographic to do this. Having a solid understanding of the brand identity and niche can help make this process quicker and more successful. Growing page likes is important as audience engagement is essential to making the most of investments in social media marketing. Encouraging page likes is one way to grow an audience. One way to do this is through doing page-like campaigns to get people to follow a practice on social media.</p>\r\n<p>The primary business goal is to generate sales. In the medical field, this means finding potential patients seeking services and getting them to contact one&#8217;s office. Lead generation is more successful after a business gains a decent level of brand awareness. People are more likely to hear about a practice through social media than to land organically on a page through a search engine. One way to do this is by starting a social media campaign geared towards link clicks. This campaign can increase a website&#8217;s SEO and get more people to visit the website and learn more about the services available.</p>\r\n<h3>Diversifying Types of Content</h3>\r\n<p>Once a social media strategy is in place, the next step is to create content. Creating content that informs and interests people can draw in potential patients. Posts should vary depending on the platforms used instead of relying on the same type of content. Diversifying content through various images, videos, polls, contests, and more can lead to more audience engagement and interest.</p>\r\n<p>Add hashtags to posts and engage the audience by asking questions, sharing pictures of patients (with permission) on social media, and showing engagement in the local community. One can also use the story features on social media to get followers interested in what they do. While a social media marketing strategy can also include advertisements, including content that feels organic helps visitors relate and feel more connected while interacting online.</p>\r\n<h2>Reach More Patients</h2>\r\n<p>Growing your social media presence and connecting with your audience through interactive marketing can help you reach more people.

However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/what-is-barnacle-seo/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Using the right keywords is important for your business. However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to rank on their own with so much competition. Barnacle SEO is an effective technique in these situations to help such businesses rank for competitive keywords. Here is why this technique is effective and why our team at Doctor Genius prefers to use it.</p>\r\n<h2>An Overview of Barnacle SEO</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008, Search Influence&#8217;s Will Scott coined the term &#8220;barnacle SEO&#8221; to describe the process of smaller businesses attaching their names to larger, more established domains to benefit from their authority. Using established websites that rank for the most popular and competitive keywords can help a small or new business rank higher without doing the same work necessary for traditional SEO.</p>\r\n<p>Barnacle SEO mimics the relationship that takes place in the natural world between barnacles and whales. Barnacles, tiny arthropods no bigger than an inch in diameter, attach themselves to a moving object, like a whale, to gather nutrients from the current. Similar to this relationship, a business can benefit from attaching its name to a search engine whale. The business can go wherever the search engine whale goes, even to the top of the SERPs. The barnacle and whale relationship is a commensal one. The barnacle does not hurt the whale, nor does it help it. However, in order to make the most of the barnacle SEO technique, it is important to act more like a partner to the big websites and less like a parasite.</p>\r\n<h3>Guest Blogging</h3>\r\n<p>Guest blogging is one of the most popular barnacle SEO activities. This particular strategy involves reaching out to websites and pitching a guest blog post. Doing this can seem intimidating for small and new businesses. However, blogs with authority may be willing to work with smaller ones, especially if helping out means adding another article to be ranked on their website. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before reaching out to a website, it is beneficial to research topics that are trending in a particular niche. It is also helpful to consider topics that have not had much coverage but may benefit readers. Identify top blogs and craft an attractive pitch for a guest blog post. If the website is big enough, a guest blog can receive many visitors and shares.</p>\r\n<h3>Types of Websites to Target</h3>\r\n<p>Using barnacle SEO does not always involve asking for a guest blog appearance. Another activity involves targeting websites that people use daily. These websites are online directories and publishing platforms. Some commonly used websites for barnacle SEO are Google My Business, Angie&#8217;s List, Facebook, and TripAdvisor. It is also beneficial to identify websites that specifically cater to one&#8217;s niche. Once the target sites are identified, one can create a profile to list their business and begin using barnacle SEO.</p>\r\n<h3>Leverage Review Sites</h3>\r\n<p>There are several benefits to leveraging review sites. One significant advantage is that it can help with SEO. Review sites like TripAdvisor, Google My Business, Yelp, Angie&#8217;s List, and Foursquare have a lot of search engine authority. Make sure to keep all information up-to-date on each review site. It is also essential to complete a profile and include all the information that potential customers will need, like the business location, hours, and services. </p>\r\n<p>A strong profile with positive customer reviews can help to rank higher for local searches. In addition to boosting online reputation, it is also a great way to get more direct and organic traffic. When creating a profile, it is also necessary to consider the types of terms that typically rank well for review sites. Some examples are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">(Product or service) review</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">(Product or service) alternatives</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Tools like (product or service)</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Writing for Publishing Platforms</h3>\r\n<p>Listing a business on online directories is a popular barnacle SEO strategy, but other options can also yield good results. Writing for any of the many publishing platforms can help expand reach. One of the most popular and effective publishing platforms is Medium. Medium consistently ranks on the first page for competitive key terms in various industries, from business to health. Another benefit of Medium is that its results often include featured snippets.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post\">Publishing on Medium</a> is fairly straightforward. It is acceptable to target an industry&#8217;s most competitive key terms when using barnacle SEO. Here is an overview of the process:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Conduct keyword research</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Select the search intent</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Optimize content so it aligns with the target keyword</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use subheadings and incorporate keywords where possible</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Embed or add creatives, such as images, infographics, and video</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Above all, make sure the writing is of high quality. Medium has domain authority, so write like an authority figure. The content should be easy to read and understand but also informative and factual.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill.
