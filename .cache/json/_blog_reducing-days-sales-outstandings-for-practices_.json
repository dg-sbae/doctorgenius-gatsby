This number measures the size of outstanding accounts based on average sales days instead of units of currency. The DSO can be quickly calculated by dividing the total of accounts receivable from a certain period of time by the complete sum of credit sales during that same amount of time, then dividing the answer by how many days were in that period.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/d/days-sales-outstanding-dso\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/d/days-sales-outstanding-dso\">Investing Answers</a> suggests the DSO is crucial because it is a measure of how quickly a company collects money, which directly correlates to the efficiency and profitability of the company. A medical practice is no exception. Comparing the DSO of several practices can show which ones are better at managing credit and efficiently using receivables to foster growth. A practice can also compare its DSO numbers over time to tell whether it is becoming more or less efficient. </p>\r\n<h2>Ways to reduce the DSO for your practice</h2>\r\n<p>If your practice has a high DSO, there are several ways both the staff and patients can help lower it.</p>\r\n<h3>Examine customer payment terms</h3>\r\n<p>A practice with looser payment terms generally has a higher DSO than one with very strict terms. How long do patients have to pay a bill once they leave the office? Is payment required at the time of service? Establishing a balance of common industry standards, the DSO of your practice and the needs of the patients can help pinpoint the necessary terms to offer. </p>\r\n<h3>Switch to automated billing</h3>\r\n<p>Particularly for practices with a high ratio of patients to staff members, it can be a good idea to have an automated billing process. This helps ensure bills are sent out on time and do not get lost in the shuffle. Simply put, the faster patients receive a bill, the faster they can pay it. If your practice still sends out paper statements and bills, you may want to consider electronic billing. Online invoicing and billing make it possible for a patient to receive and pay a bill the same day it is sent out instead of days or weeks later. This method also allows payments to be easily tracked as opposed to checks and payment stubs that can be more labor-intensive to monitor. </p>\r\n<h3>Pay attention to invoicing</h3>\r\n<p>Even if your billing is already automated, it is important to be detailed when inputting patient and invoicing information. A bill sent to the wrong patient or address will not get paid. Are the invoices accurate and being sent out on time? Even small errors in amounts due or account numbers can end up costing the practice significant amounts of money. Spot-checking invoices is a good way to find and fix common errors that can delay payments and increase the DSO. </p>\r\n<h3>Offer multiple methods of payment</h3>\r\n<p>The fastest way to get paid is obviously to ask the patients for payments upfront. However, there are cases where patients may not be able to pay the full amount at once and need to spread out payments. Rather than sending out monthly statements and bills and relying on the patient to mail a check or call and make a payment over the phone, consider having an online payment portal. A well-planned internet payment system can allow patients to view statements and make payments quickly and easily. The less work involved with paying a bill, the more likely and faster a patient is to pay it. </p>\r\n<h3>Consistently follow up with patients</h3>\r\n<p>Following up can be one of the most effective ways to make sure patients do not ignore invoices. Email reminders and text message reminders typically work well, and phone call reminders can be even better because of the personal touch of talking directly to another human being. This can be particularly helpful with bills that are past due. To keep your practice&#8217;s DSO where it should be, which is ideally 10-15 days beyond the terms of sale, staff members need to be proactive about sending reminders or making phone calls. </p>\r\n<h3>Offer incentives</h3>\r\n<p>Far from costing the practice money, offering early payment discounts can be a smart way to keep cash flow in the practice instead of tied up in accounts receivable. It can be a win for both the practice and the patientd, because the patients pay less and the practice gets the capital sooner. Having a faster cash flow, getting better rates from creditors, and saving interest on loan fees are just a few ways receiving faster patient payments can improve the balance sheet of a practice. Charging a late payment penalty is another option to help offset some of the costs the practice incurs when the billing moves to a collections department. </p>\r\n<h3>Stay committed</h3>\r\n<p>Lowering your DSO does not happen overnight. If your goal is to reduce it by 20 days, it can take several months to see significant progress. While it can be motivating to see that number drop, the initial excitement of making a difference can wear off quickly. Effecting significant improvements and sustaining them long-term requires a change of habits in everyone from the executives to the billing department. Setting expectations for the staff regarding accounts receivable and regularly discussing DSO metrics can help maintain focus and ensure all the effort put into lowering the DSO is not wasted. </p>\r\n<h2>We can help you improve practice management</h2>\r\n<p>There are many ways to take your practice management skills to the next level.

While you may have<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/marketing-funnel-for-patients/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>In general, the marketing funnel describes the process of generating leads and converting them into customers. While you may have a clear idea of what this progression looks like from the perspective of a medical practitioner, visualizing the funnel from the viewpoint of the patient can help you understand why each step in the process is essential and focus on strategies that your target audience is more likely to respond to.</p>\r\n<h2>The stages of the marketing funnel</h2>\r\n<p>There are several different representations used to explain the steps of the marketing funnel, which can range from three to eight stages or more. However, no matter the number or label used, the process typically covers awareness, consideration, and purchase. Each of these steps affects the patient experience in a unique way and depends on the other to guide the individual towards making a purchase.</p>\r\n<h3>Awareness</h3>\r\n<p>The first part of the marketing funnel, often called lead generation from an advertiser’s point of view, is the moment when the patient first becomes aware of your medical practice and services. There are several ways a person can come to this step, including exposure through viewing an advertisement placed on a social media site, seeing your practice on the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/\">search engine ranking page</a> after searching for a related keyword such as “family dentist near Roseville,” or hearing about your practice from a friend or family member. While there is much more that goes in advertising and targeting from your end as the medical practitioner or owner of a medical office, the introduction should feel natural and simple to the patient.</p>\r\n<h3>Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>After patients become aware of your brand, they transition into the consideration stage. For people who do not connect with your practice or are not in need of the services you offer, the interaction may end here. For those who are part of your target audience or within your scope of influence, this step is critical for securing a conversion.</p>\r\n<p>The patient wants to know that you offer the needed services, have a good reputation, and are qualified to do the job at hand. While some patients may be ready to employ your services quickly, others may need more time in the consideration stage. These individuals may explore your website for reviews and testimonials, browse through any <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/\">educational content on your site</a>, search for your educational background and areas of expertise, or ask questions and engage with your office to determine if it is a good fit.</p>\r\n<h3>Purchase</h3>\r\n<p>Next, the patient makes the choice to call your office and sent up an initial appointment. Even after deciding to get your services, however, patients may hesitate or forget to follow through. Automated email reminders, calls from a staff member, free consultation offers, or invitations to a special webinar can all help guide them to finalizing the appointment.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you master the marketing funnel</h2>\r\n<p>Knowing how to effectively guide potential patients through the marketing funnel takes significant expertise and practice.

According to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301787889_Burnout_in_DentistryAn_overview\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301787889_Burnout_in_DentistryAn_overview\">study done at ResearchGate</a>, dental employees are getting burned out due to a disconnect between the demands and resources of the job and personal goals, skills, and abilities. Employers can turn this work exhaustion around through practice management that is fun, exciting, and different. Make your employees want to come to work with these methods.</p>\r\n<h2>The importance of making work fun</h2>\r\n<p>Employees who dread coming to work are far less likely to put full effort into the job. This not only affects everyone’s <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/\">mental and physical health</a>, but it can also negatively impact your business. Patients may notice when an employee seems lethargic or disinterested, and in an industry that is based heavily on in-person communication and personal connections, this can prevent patients from returning to your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to improve staff satisfaction</h2>\r\n<p>There are endless ways you can make work more enjoyable for employees and yourself. To get an idea of what will truly benefit your employees, ask around for ideas or run through suggestions. See what seems to click with them and what should be avoided. To get started, here are four methods that can improve work attitudes and rejuvenate the office atmosphere.  </p>\r\n<h3>1. Focus on communication</h3>\r\n<p>Communication is key regardless of what industry you work in, and there are specific aspects that you can focus on to positively impact your employees. For example, simply showing appreciation now and then for work efforts can boost your team’s confidence. Prioritizing organization can make sure that everyone understands what is going on in the office and prevents frustration over miscommunications. Listening is a key part of communication, so when you ask your employees what can be fixed, show that you listened by actually addressing the problems.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Try flexible hours</h3>\r\n<p>Providing flexible work hours can demonstrate that you care about employees’ personal lives. If an important event or emergency arises, an employee with flexible hours can feel confident in changing the work schedule without the fear of being ostracized. This helps reduce the stresses of the work-life balance without shorting either.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Organize office-wide activities</h3>\r\n<p>Fun games, happy hour get-togethers after work, and charitable activities, such as volunteering for community service, can help everyone bond and learn to work effectively together. Team-building in other areas can help employees appreciate each other more back in the office. Social gatherings, such as throwing everyone a party at the end of the year to celebrate successes, allows people to connect on a personal level that does not involve work.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Improve the office space</h3>\r\n<p>Sometimes little changes are what people notice the most. Decorating the office for seasons or holidays can liven everyone’s day and break up the regular pace. Putting in plants, adding new furniture that optimizes the office’s workspace, and even <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240985\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240985\">providing food</a> can energize everyone and increase office production.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover more great changes</h2>\r\n<p>Elevating employees e can benefit everyone who enters your medical practice, including both employees and patients.
