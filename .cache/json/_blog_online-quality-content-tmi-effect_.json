When it comes to investing in a medical service or purchasing a product, potential customers may actually avoid websites with too much information or text. Information overload can lead to people seeking services elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<h3>Avoiding too much information</h3>\r\n\r\nIn a study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS, titled “On Making the Right Choice: The Deliberation-Without-Attention Effect,” participants chose between four cars. With one car being better than the rest, the first group of participants was given four facts about each car while a second group was given 12 facts about each car.\r\n\r\nThe results show that the group that had less information chose the better car 60 percent of the time. The group that was given 12 facts about the cars only chose the best care 20 percent of the time. This study is only one example of how too much information can dissuade a potential buyer and the same applies to potential patients for a medical practice.\r\n\r\nWith the advancements of the digital market, a variety of businesses continues to rush to create a website representing their brand, services, products and company information. Medical practices also greatly benefit from having websites. However, overloading a website with too much content will actually have a negative instead of a positive effect on the website’s conversion rate.\r\n\r\n<h3>Quality content for the audience</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-668\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-7-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> Thus, professional practice websites need to balance quality with comprehension.<p></div>\r\n\r\nWhile a website does need the right amount of content to describe services and rank online, clogging up pages with too much content or too many complex terms can make it difficult for potential patients to navigate. It is important to remember that the people looking at a medical practice’s website will be people outside of the medical field. Thus, professional practice websites need to balance quality with comprehension.\r\n\r\nIn an article online, Google states that ranking based on numbers and factors that include the freshness, diversity, rich textual and originality of content. Another factor to consider is that keywords can rank higher in search results without requiring a large amount of dense content. This is why it is crucial to have a company who understands the ins and outs of online marketing and content creation.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we can help you reach more potential patients with custom content. We strategically create content that matches your needs while also helping the website rank on search results to bring in more patients. Making a website more complex and dense will lower the conversion for potential patients.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in creating a website for your practice and branching out into the digital market, give us a call today.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

In 2015, Google found that 51 percent of smartphone users discovered a new company or product when conducting a search on a smartphone. Similar to how commercials on TV are still relevant to promoting products, having an easily accessible website that works on mobile devices is crucial for any successful practice.\r\n\r\n<h3>Easy access</h3>\r\n\r\nWith the invention of smartphones, society began to rely on these devices for more than a few apps and phone calls. Google also found that in 2015, more Google searches took place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan. A professional practice will greatly benefit from a website that is mobile-first.\r\n\r\nMany people may browse potential dentists or doctors in their local area by searching on their smartphone while watching TV at home. Regardless, mobile searches are a crucial aspect of how potential patients determine which practice they will choose. A website that takes too long to load or is too complex to use will only motivate the patient to search other practices. Also, Google will not rank a website that takes too long to load. Thus, it is crucial to have a mobile first website.\r\n\r\nA mobile first website means that when people search the website on their smartphone or tablet devices with a smaller screen than a computer, the website is responsive or will load proportionately to the screen. At Doctor Genius, our clients can rest easy knowing that we pride ourselves on building mobile first websites to help bring in potential patients.\r\n\r\n<h3>All the necessary information on the go</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-685\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-15-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Google also found that in 2015, more Google searches took place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and Japan.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhile cell phones of the past were a technological revolution for providing call services from virtually anywhere without a cord, smartphones are famous for being able to access thousands of search results anytime anywhere. With today’s smartphone, people can have equal or more computing power to a desktop computer.\r\n\r\nProfessionals need to ensure that their website has all of the necessary information readily available and easy to access on any device. If a potential patient looks at a client’s website on a smartphone and finds that the page does not work or load properly, they will probably dismiss it.\r\n\r\nThus, Doctor Genius will set up a mobile first website that works on multiple devices and stands out in the digital market.

Fortunately, there are specific steps that one can take to reach a higher level of healthy online activity and success. The team at Doctor Genius has the knowledge and expertise to utilize the correct keywords for a client’s website and help increase their ranking online. However, effective keywords are more than simply choosing any words related to a field of medicine.\r\n<h3>What are keywords?</h3>\r\nKeywords are words or phrases that match up with terms people type in search engines online. For instance, Google explains that, “Selecting high quality, relevant keywords for your advertising campaign can help you reach the customers you want, when you want.” With so many possible terms and phrases to use, it is crucial and beneficial to invest in the services of someone who understands how to pick effective keywords.\r\n\r\nKeywords will help a professional’s website show up higher in list results of searches. This way, our clients can have their websites rank higher on search results and increase website traffic for the chance of gaining new patients. In 2015, Advanced Web Ranking found that there is a 31.5 percent click through rate for the number one position on mobile Google search results.\r\n\r\n<h3>How do keywords work?</h3>\r\nBy choosing keywords that people commonly type in search engines, your website will have a stronger chance of appearing at the top section of the search results. For instance, a common keyword can be “Emergency Dentist,” or “Whitening.” By making these keywords, people who type that word or phrase into a search engine most likely find your website before others.\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers went to a store within five miles of their home after completing a local search.<p></div>\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not as simple as flooding a website with keywords and waiting by the phone.\r\n\r\n<h3>How do you select effective keywords?</h3>\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-660\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-Aug-1-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, members of our professional team help you select the keywords that are effective in ranking and pertain to your professional services. With so many methods for selecting keywords, it can be easy to select an ineffective or faulty service. Thus, Doctor Genius will help you select the effective keywords to enhance your website.\r\n\r\nWe can also help clients use keywords that market to the local area. In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers went to a store within five miles of their home after completing a local search. It is crucial to select keywords that will rank in that area.\r\n<h3>Should I only focus on keywords?</h3>\r\nWhile keywords are an important tool for any professional’s website, they are not the only tool a professional needs. A website needs constant updates to show Google that it is active while also utilizing reviews that are a huge factor in ranking. Doctor Genius can help keep a website active and monitor social media accounts of the practice to help increase that rate of potential patients.\r\n\r\nTo answer the question, “Are Keywords Effective?” The answer is yes. However, effective keywords are only part of a much larger set of tools necessary to communicate with Google effectively. If you are interested in our services or more information about keywords, give us a call today.\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
