While neural matching has not replaced the previous algorithms used to generate Google search results, it does play a role in how the latest Google core update ranks webpages.</p>\r\n<h2>Neural matching</h2>\r\n<p>Google has always been somewhat secretive about how its search algorithms work. Additionally, the company does not use every algorithm it has developed and does not usually disclose which algorithms are in use at any one time. The reasoning is that if Google revealed exactly how the algorithms work, it would be easy for users to exploit them to artificially boost their pages to the top of the search results. </p>\r\n<h3>What neural matching is</h3>\r\n<p>Neural matching is part of the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">most recent update</a> to Google&#8217;s search algorithm. It utilizes artificial intelligence to make search results more diverse. The use of AI technology makes it easier for the Google search engine to analyze language and interpret the intent of search queries. This allows Google to match a webpage to a query based solely on the text of the webpage. </p>\r\n<p>One way the neural matching algorithm is expected to improve the search engine&#8217;s ability to interpret queries is by making it better at recognizing when people search for a term that means the same thing as a keyword on a webpage. It is estimated that this algorithm will affect about 30% of user queries.</p>\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub47324/\">research paper released by Google</a>, the algorithm may use document relevance ranking to determine the best search results while avoiding spam and irrelevant results. In other words, this algorithm could help the search engine figure out which results are the best and rank those the highest while pushing pages that try to game the system or have little relevance to the query lower in the rankings. </p>\r\n<h3>How neural matching affects search engine optimization</h3>\r\n<p>The core concept of neural matching is to reward content creators for effectively answering the questions posed by users in queries and de-emphasize the role of links and keywords. However, this does not mean that Google has completely abandoned the traditional ranking criteria used by the core algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>Rather, it is believed that the traditional criteria are applied first to thin the herd by removing spam and irrelevant pages from the results. Then, the new algorithm is used to re-rank the remaining results, so that the most useful results receive the top rankings. Doctor Genius can help content creators improve page rankings by creating content that is useful to users while also establishing the basic credibility and relevance of the content by attracting high-quality backlinks and including relevant keywords.</p>\r\n<h2>Optimize your SEO</h2>\r\n<p>The implementation of neural matching has not radically changed how Google rankings work. However, it could impact how your pages rank. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact Doctor Genius today</a> to find out how we can help you optimize your pages to make the most of this new neural matching algorithm. </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Relying on the same generic pictures that everyone else in your industry is using can reflect poorly on your company. By focusing on appealing to more users with unique, eye-catching photos, you have a better chance at ranking higher on search engines and improving your overall SEO. Learn how to take your digital marketing efforts a step further by including pictures of your office on your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Knowing when to use stock or original photos</h2>\r\n<p>While using unique imagery throughout your company website would be ideal for most effectively branding your company, it is not always practical to include an original photograph every time you need an image on a page. If you&#8217;re using a mix of stock and personal photos on your site, it is important you know when it is acceptable to use stock photos and when you should use a photographer.</p>\r\n<h3>When to use stock photos</h3>\r\n<p>Stock photos can easily be found online and may be free or sold for a low price, depending on the site you use. Some of these photos are very high-quality, effective photographs and can be used for your ads and campaigns in situations where you need to save money and get the image out right away. While these photos may be professional quality, most people can tell the image came from a stock image site, so use these sparingly. </p>\r\n<h3>When to use original photos</h3>\r\n<p>Original photos are images that you produce in-house by either taking your own pictures or hiring a professional photographer. Using your own pictures is most essential when you are trying to create a personal connection with your patients and show them the faces behind your company. By including pictures of staff members and using real photos of your office throughout the website, your potential patients get to know you better and are more likely to choose to use your services with you as a result.</p>\r\n<h2>Making your images SEO friendly</h2>\r\n<p>While it is almost always better to use your own images on your site, you still need to pay attention to how they are being used to have the best ranking. For the best SEO results, keep the following tips in mind:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Use images on every page, including with every blog post</li>\r\n\t<li>Place images near the text it applies to</li>\r\n\t<li>Give the photo a unique name that matches the subject matter</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduce the file size by compressing it without compromising quality</li>\r\n\t<li>Consider the format of the photo and how you plan to use it</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure your images are compatible with mobile devices</li>\r\n\t<li>Resize the image to the appropriate size</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Make the biggest impact on future patients</h2>\r\n<p>Patients choose medical providers they can trust, which is why using original photos that let your patients get to know you better is so beneficial.

Utilizing keywords does nothing if readers do not read your posts. You want high conversion numbers, and shorter attention spans may put even the most SEO-optimized site at risk. Learn how to create articles that readers can quickly skim to glean the highlights.</p>\r\n<h2>How ranking and content work together</h2>\r\n<p>Google uses algorithms to increase a page&#8217;s visibility during a search return. The higher your site ranks, the more likely a potential client is to click on your page. However, getting clicks is just the beginning. Your content format must also engage and appeal to your practice&#8217;s target audience. Your blog posts should be easy to read, focusing on <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-express-your-practices-brand-online/\">topics and information relevant</a> to your practice. When we at DG create content, we focus on making them topical and easy to read.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing blogs for your target audience</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/\">Time magazine</a>, the average person gives an article approximately 15 seconds before abandoning it. You have to hook potential clients in that short time. Utilizing methods designed to provide them with information in easy-to-digest chunks can help. Employing several methods in posts to increase reader engagement may translate into more appointments for your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Headings</h3>\r\n<p>A good strategy to help appeal to a skimmer is utilizing headings. As in this article, paragraph headers break up content by topics. While this alone may not be enough to convey your message to readers, it can direct the eyes to the portions of your content that appeal directly to them. For instance, if your interest lies in creating lists, you may jump to the heading entitled &#8220;Bullet Points&#8221; in this article. Headings direct readers to the information they seek.</p>\r\n<h3>Bullet points</h3>\r\n<p>As a way to further maximize skimming, integrate bullet points and lists into your posts. There are a variety of ways you can do this effectively. Try not to overuse this method as your content will wind up looking like a to-do list rather than an informative and engaging post. Some elements that lend themselves easily to bullet lists include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Symptoms and signs</li>\r\n\t<li>Frequently prescribed medications</li>\r\n\t<li>Common diagnoses</li>\r\n\t<li>Treatment options</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When readers start by reading lists, it may catch their attention and prompt them to finish the article for more insight.</p>\r\n<h3>Visual aids</h3>\r\n<p>People may gravitate to posts that contain visual content other than words. Integrating photographs, graphs, and charts into your content may capture potential clients by giving them something colorful to ponder. Visual representations of medical conditions, such as cavities, may also help readers understand what they need to watch for in themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Get help hooking clients</h2>\r\n<p>Your practice hinges on new patients, and grabbing their attention requires content that is easily digestible and informative.
