Without the requisite knowledge to inform<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>As a medical provider, staying on top of new advances and developments is crucial. Without the requisite knowledge to inform patients of options and effectively treat them, you will not only suffer a loss of business, but you also may suffer a loss of professional integrity. While it is essential to stay grounded in older routines and those products that are still relevant, newer tools may provide more opportunities to attract new clients and offer new options to existing ones. Understanding what happens from the time medical products are introduced until they become irrelevant may help when it comes to medical marketing.</p>\r\n<h2>Staying informed of new trends</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to providing the best options for patient treatment, technological trends and developments are crucial. The ability to introduce patients to a full array of potential solutions to health problems results in a higher rate of successful recovery. Keeping an eye on medical journals, doing independent research on clinical trials, and speaking with an equipment representative may prove sufficient to stay abreast of trends.</p>\r\n<h2>The stages of medical products</h2>\r\n<p>Once a new medical product becomes available, company reps strive to reach relevant practices. The more medical providers use it and prescribe it, the higher the chance that it will gain notoriety. According to <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/product-life-cycle-14882534\">thestreet.com</a>, typical product lifecycle management contains four benchmarks: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Each of these stages requires unique marketing strategies to remain competitive.</p>\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Bringing a new medical product to the market can prove difficult, especially if the first phase of the lifecycle is not successful. In the introduction, the company is trying to gain some awareness of the product. Activities during this time include promotions geared towards those medical practices that have patients who may benefit from the new product. </p>\r\n<h3>Growth</h3>\r\n<p>Once the product finds a measure of success, the distributor will want to broaden its horizons and target other areas of the medical community that might utilize it. The distributor may start to change the branding of the product to make it more appealing to a broader audience. Something used primarily for one health condition may be pushed for aiding with another. As long as the data backs up the claims, providers may give it a try.</p>\r\n<h3>Maturity</h3>\r\n<p>Business strategy changes the more successful a product becomes. When product sales plateau, it is a signal that it has reached maturity. To keep the company&#8217;s name at the forefront of the medical community, it now has to make some clear changes to the product or its marketing. In some cases, this results in a 2.0 version of the same item.</p>\r\n<h3>Decline</h3>\r\n<p>When competitors introduce rival products, and sales start to decrease, the lifecycle is declining. This means that a company must either completely reformulate and reintroduce the product or come up with something new.</p>\r\n<h2>Help when you need it</h2>\r\n<p>Convincing clients that your practice is on top of the latest medical products and trends gives them confidence that you are looking out for the best avenues for treatment.

The internet has made it easier than ever for consumers to find providers beyond their local regions and to consult with physicians states or even countries away. While this ease of access is great for individuals, it creates a highly competitive landscape for health care providers, as you may well know. As a result, you as a provider should continually look for opportunities to optimize your site not just for search, but for local search. While SEO content is one of the strongest ways to do this, structured data — or “schema markup” — can put you well ahead of the competition.  </p>\r\n<h2>Understanding structured data</h2>\r\n<p>Structured data markup helps define information in such a way that the search bots can better understand the context of your page, delivering “rich snippets.” HTML, on the other hand, simply tells the bots how to display text included in a tag.</p>\r\n<p>Neil Patel explains the <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/get-started-using-schema/#:~:text=Schema%20markup%20is%20code%20(semantic,schema%20markup%20is%20all%20about.&amp;text=The%20schema%20markup%20told%20the,schedule%20of%20upcoming%20hotel%20events.\">ins and outs of schema markup</a>. In a nutshell, schema markup can help you create a virtual business card. While non-marked-up results pull from title tags and meta descriptions to return generic information about your practice, marked-up results can show users everything from your practice’s name to its ratings to its hours, all right there in the SERPs. Before rich snippets were introduced, this kind of data — numbers, ratings, etc. — were not understood by the search bots and, therefore, ignored.</p>\r\n<h2>Using structured data to reach local patients</h2>\r\n<p>The most obvious way structured data can help you reach and attract local patients is by helping Google read items such as your map and phone number so it can include that information in the SERPs. While your content probably mentions your city and state several times for SEO purposes, schema markup makes it possible to show potential patients exactly where you are located, down to the suite number.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, location is just one factor patients consider before selecting a provider. Patients also want to find a provider who is in the right field, who offers their insurance, and who has stellar patient reviews. Unlike HTML tags, which offer you limited space to tell searchers what your practice is about, structured data lets you <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/structured-data/index.html#0\">describe a page in as detailed a manner as possible</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For example, in the “@type” section, you can describe the type of content your page promises. In the “@description” section, you can include what you do (“A cosmetic dentist with 15 years of perfecting smiles.”) and/or a list of insurance your practice accepts. The “aggregate rating” section lets you input your best and worst ratings, and Google will deliver the average. All of the information you choose to put in your markup can help local searchers make the most informed decisions possible without them ever having to click through to your website.</p>\r\n<h2>Create meaningful results</h2>\r\n<p>From <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">writing for skimmers</a> to writing for the search bots, our team at Doctor Genius is familiar with the strongest tactics for attracting new patients and ranking well in the search engines.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
