You opened a practice. Now, you are using every possible method to build your practice. However, no matter what methods you try, there is an apparent lack of new patients. No matter what you attempt, there seem to be fewer and fewer patients walking through the door of your practice. Fortunately, we have the solution through our Online Marketing Services at Doctor Genius.\r\n\r\n<h3>More than just online marketing</h3>\r\n\r\nAfter asking 4,500 marketing and sales professionals, Hubspot.com found that 65 percent of these professionals stated that generating traffic and leads for their company was the most difficult step. It is easy for a company to throw terms such as “local search” at possible clients and not provide effective services. In many cases, dentists will look for a company to help enhance or build a website, by comparing the price. In reality, dentists need to compare performance rather than price.\r\n\r\nFollowing the mortgage market failing in 2008, small mortgage companies throughout the United States began going out of business and closing their doors. Thus, the industry for local online marketing began really taking off. With so many companies offering marketing services, professionals struggle to find a credible service.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we pride ourselves on performance and building a relationship with the clients to promote their practice. Unlike other companies that may run online marketing techniques in the beginning, but not have the client’s interest at heart, Doctor Genius strives to bring a client’s desires to fruition. Doctor Genius will work with the client from day one to create a mobile-friendly platform for the clients’ private practice.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-529\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20b-TheStudy-The-Most-Common-Tech-Problem-for-Dentists-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Building a reliable connection with clients</h3>\r\n\r\nWe strive to set up a positive relationship with clients by implementing the client’s requests into a mobile-friendly website. At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Create informative content using Google’s current algorithm changes</li>\r\n \t<li>Develop pages from the needs and requests of clients</li>\r\n \t<li>Help keep the website active with monthly blog posts</li>\r\n \t<li>Help funnel traffic from search engines to the website</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWith the available payment plans, the price will not need to be as large of a concern as with other services. Whatever the price may be, Doctor Genius will provide the performance necessary to help a private practice reach success. If we can help clients receive between 25 to 50 new patient inquiries every single month, then the price should not prevent owners from promoting their private practices.\r\n\r\nOur results help clients build trust with us in understanding that we provide more than placing specific terms on a digital platform. We build the website and work with the client to create a website that represents their practices. You can feel confident in knowing that we will help accurately represent your practice’s vision and mission statement online.\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

In fact, a dental professional may feel something akin to déjà vu in telling patients to keep up regular dental hygiene. Patients may not realize that there are multiple reasons to work with the dental treatment and to continue visiting a dentist. Fortunately, we have the tools to help spread the word about your practice and draw in new patients by displaying a comforting atmosphere online.\r\n<h3>A guiding source of oral health care</h3>\r\nIn all forms of medicine and treatment, people who participate in their treatment find better results. Healthaffairs.org reviews data from a Health Policy Brief, stating that “A growing body of evidence demonstrates that patients who are more actively involved in their health care experience better health outcomes and incur lower costs.”\r\n\r\nMore importantly, patients are beginning to move to these locations that successfully help people achieve higher levels of health. Healthaffairs.org also states that “many public and private health care organizations are employing strategies to better engage patients, such as educating them about their conditions and involving them more fully in making decisions about their care.”\r\n\r\nTo compete, dental professionals need to have a website that engages the patient and acts as a source of information for the patient’s needs. Professionals can engage patients in a positive way before even seeing them in the office with a strong online presence. At Doctor Genius, we can help to do this by displaying important information in a positive manner.\r\n<h3>Create content that matters</h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-541\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/patient-involvement-img2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/patient-involvement-img2.png 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/patient-involvement-img2-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />We not only offer information about the client’s dental practice on the website, but we also offer tips for patients’ overall health. We create content that will help motivate patients to keep up healthy oral hygiene at home and visit the dentist on a regular basis. By creating an informative and helpful website, patients will feel better about remaining with our client instead of going elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHowever, we stress that at-home care will only accomplish so much in terms of keeping teeth healthy. On the website, we point out that the patient needs to seek your services for professional care and treatment. A dental professional can identify any signs of potential infection or disease and treat it before it spreads.\r\n\r\nWith the correct content, patients will refer to your website for information and schedule an appointment. We can help engage the patient to help them become more active in their treatment. It all begins with an effective website, which is what we can offer dental professionals. We have the tools and resources to keep a website and social media page active.

We will use the proper branding to highlight the client’s services and areas of expertise.\r\n\r\n<h3>Search Marketing</h3>\r\nWe can narrow down the list of keywords to the words that most frequently appear in people’s searches online. With a list of keywords for each client, we can work to yield higher numbers of new patient inquiries into one’s practice.\r\n\r\n<h3>Review Management</h3>\r\nWe can highlight positive and easily-readable reviews of a client’s practice on the website. After reading the reviews, patients will be more likely to consider a practice for dental care.\r\n\r\n<h3>Hyper-Local Targeting</h3>\r\nWe will increase the focus of a client’s website to the local area and enhance the client’s reach to possible patients there. By targeting the local area, we can help the client rank higher online in the local area.\r\n\r\n<h3>Social Media</h3>\r\nWe will not only help monitor and create regular posts for the client’s social media pages, but we will also ensure that the social media pages remain active and engage followers.\r\n\r\n<h3>Start with a strong foot forward</h3>\r\nWe help clients build trustworthy relationships with their patients by providing strong online content.
