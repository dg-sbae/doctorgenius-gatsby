Thus, our team strives to help practices build effective methods for maximizing their services with informative and active online content. Along with that, we can help clients reach patients in more ways than before with technology.</p>\r\n<p>We will take the time to work with you and determine what your practice is going to need going forward. As the months in quarantine continue, there is a gradual decrease in the number of restrictions. With that in mind, dental practices must have a plan in place for when that happens. We can help to set this system up.</p>\r\n<p>What applies to businesses can also apply to dental and medical practices. Here are some various opportunities in store for dental practices that take a proactive approach.</p>\r\n<h2>The Opportunities that lie ahead</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies are not sitting idly and watching the situation unfold. They have adapted to the current situation and expanded their business models, reordered their production lines, and focused on new needs. The summary is that they have observed the market trends and taken calculated risks, using COVID-19 as the rocket fuel for growth in some areas and resuscitating dormant potentials in others.</p>\r\n<p>Many establishments are moving online, digitizing most of their processes to increase the speed of executing projects and eliminating backlogs. In terms of productivity, there has been a significant rise in cloud services for work collaborations, solutions to reduce paperwork and physical contact, reimbursement apps and digital solutions for accounting, and the rise of contactless devices in several areas.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can help clients build an effective website and system that focuses on reaching patients. We will help to have a set plan in place for when the quarantine restrictions are lifted. The sooner dentists begin taking proactive steps toward the current situation, the sooner they can begin to prepare for success.</p>\r\n<h3>Business models</h3>\r\n<p>A prolonged crisis like this can force changes in customer profiles. Customers’ behavioral patterns are likely to change due to a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, many people will start ordering more regularly and receive door deliveries, even after the lockdown. Others will possibly increase online transactions. Businesses that pay attention to the customer profile changes can go on to build more efficient business models.</p>\r\n<h3>Remote work and service delivery</h3>\r\n<p>Renting an office space can be expensive, and remote work arrangement is yet to be adopted in the full functional scope. This will create opportunities in several and related sectors, including virtual classrooms, office space redesign, development of remote work platforms, online service provisions, software systems, and cloud-based services. All of these sectors will potentially witness drastic expansion when the world starts to recover from the pandemic, and employers look to reduce the cost of office space if their staff needs to work remotely.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us Today</h2>\r\n<p>The effects of the COVID-19 is under review by many experts, both in terms of medical and business implications. The adverse effects of the pandemic are obvious, but this article seeks to shed light on the opportunities that are available to businesses and other establishments when faced with a crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

This program combines our digital marketing solutions seamlessly to drive patients to your practice by leveraging content, utilizing our mobile-first web design, social media, online directories, uploading SEO-centered content, and more. This package can help to benefit your practice in multiple ways and help you continue to experience better connect to your patients for years to come.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of the Patient Experience Package</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your practice may provide the quality treatment that patients need, it is not always easy to have an online presence that reflects that. Along with content that displays the message you want your practice to send patients, it is crucial to create a positive patient experience. A patient’s experience typically begins with visiting your website where they then decide if they would like to proceed to appointments.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>What can the Patient Experience Package do for me?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/px\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Px</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers a plethora of benefits, such as:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instilling and promoting proper staff and patient safety</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping ensure patients have a positive experience</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring HIPAA compliance</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping save time, money, and stress</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promoting effective and continued communications with patients</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PMS integration</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leveraging content along with a mobile-first web design</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping websites provide better user experience for ranking</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting up teledentistry</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b><i>Is the patient experience that important for my website?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simple answer is yes. User experience on a website for any medical practice can greatly influence the number of people that see the website and its success. When the right plan in place tailored to the patient’s needs, a dental practice can experience greater success and patient retention. Even with google’s algorithm constantly being updated, an area with consistent importance for ranking is </span><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improving a website&#8217;s user experience</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an article on Search Engine Land, they explain how Google is working to include user experience on websites as a ranking factor. They explain, “That means if Google thinks your website users will have a poor experience on your pages, Google may not rank those pages as high as they are now.” While Google may not enact this update until 2021, there is no reason to avoid getting ready.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius can help enhance the patient experience on your website. Search Engine Land elaborates that the three areas affecting the patient experience on a website are the load time of pages, first input delay, and the visual stability of a page. In fact, Google states in their Webmaster Central Blog that “Through both internal studies and industry research, users show they prefer sites with a </span><a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">great page experience.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these changes on the horizon, it is crucial to have a website and online presence that provides a positive and comfortable patient experience. We can help you build the practice website you need to boost your patients’ experiences from the website to a checkup in the office.

These can include helping drive patient experience and loyalty, streamlining office operations, providing SEO-Centered content, helping clients stay connected with their patients, and promoting workplace safety. Amidst the post-COVID-19 outbreak world that we live in, people are interested in experiences and interactions with medical professionals that do not require unnecessary physical interaction.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can help to create an online system that promotes a positive experience and more. With the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Practice Recovery Blueprint</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we can focus on adjusting your business to meet the needs of these changing times. We will customize the plan for your needs and utilize the Patient Experience Package benefits for even greater results.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>How can you help to streamline office operations?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way to help streamline office operations involves paperless forms on the website. Patients will be able to fill out any and all forms online before the appointment. This way, there are no issues with printing out the forms, filling them out, or forgetting to bring them to the appointment. This can help make sure there is less chance of traffic in the waiting room, as well.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the website can help to get new patients started with scheduling an appointment, we can also use phone systems to help filter calls. This way, the patient will have everything they need to get started from the comfort of their own home.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>Can teledentistry help me remain in contact with my patients?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Teledentistry helps to make the process even easier for patients, allowing them to remain at home during the initial examination. Doctor Genius can help to set up a teledentistry system that will enhance the patient experience. This way, you can continue to communicate with patients, determine if they need to come to the office for treatment, and maintain oral health. This form of patient retention can also help them continue to reach out to your practice with any questions or concerns.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>Will SEO get in the way of my message?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not at all. While we will use SEO-focused content to help promote search results in Google listings, it is only one part of the solution. In fact, we will combine SEO with the type of message you want to send patients. Now, more than ever, patients need to know what practice is about and what they offer without issue. We will work with you to combine these into an effective and complete presentation online. You can find out more about how we are staying up to date on the latest changes in SEO best practices by reading how the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most recent core update affects your practice</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>How do I promote that we are following health and safety guidelines?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can help to ensure that your office has the proper PPE, and standards in place following the COVID-19 outbreak.

Along with businesses, dental practices also experience these issues, striving for a plan. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help dental and other medical practices have a plan in place for opening their practice back up after the quarantine. With our guidance and services, we can help you start things with a strong foot forward for your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Recovering after a pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>When a dental or medical practice is dealing with hard times, the best option for the owner or manager is to stay calm and evaluate every possible opportunity. The following are potential points to consider.</p>\r\n<h3>Assess the condition of the practice</h3>\r\n<p>Perform a business appraisal and decide what needs to be done urgently. It is crucial to evaluate what a dental practice has and follow current updates with the COVID-19 pandemic. As the U.S. shifts to summer, more and more restrictions will begin to loosen. With that, people will begin returning to their normal routines. Our team can help dentists evaluate what they will need to reopen effectively.</p>\r\n<p>Now is the time to get creative and deal with the situation. The result of the appraisal will provide insights on whatever needs to be adjusted to get the business running.</p>\r\n<h3>Reach out to employees and customers</h3>\r\n<p>While some practices may be open for immediate health emergencies, not every practice can do that. In many cases, practices can reach out to any scheduled patient appointments to re-schedule appointments for a few months in the future. This includes letting them know the delays they might experience with certain services or is available.</p>\r\n<p>Employees need to know if their schedules will change and the nature of work they need to do. They need to know if the practice will be restricting hours or if they will need to work remotely for some time. Our team can help go over teledentistry, what it is, and how it can help practices reach patients at home during COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h3>Reinvent the business</h3>\r\n<p>In fact, it is easier for smaller businesses to modify their business models, switch focus, and get back into the game. Our team will help evaluate how to ensure dentists can effectively reach their patients while also offering advice on how to alter their practice methods during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Pay attention to what customers might need and would buy, and direct business operations toward that. Aside from considering immediate service demands, evaluate past sales for indications of increase, decline, or stagnancy. If sales were declining or stagnant, the downtime might be the time to think about necessary changes to make when the economy gains pace once more.</p>\r\n<h3>Non-equity cash raise</h3>\r\n<p>Seek to raise money from non-equity sources. Develop strategies to get government grants. Consider the SBA initiatives in place to help small businesses. Be inventive about getting sources of cash to stay in business, including making short-term deals that relieve the current crunch.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us to Learn More</h2>\r\n<p>Like virtually everything in life, the COVID-19 pandemic will pass. It is difficult to predict what the economy and the country will look like afterward, but if the company survives this, there are opportunities to grab. Stay alert and get ready to bounce back after the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
