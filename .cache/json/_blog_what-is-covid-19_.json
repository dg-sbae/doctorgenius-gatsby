Just seven days later, the case was confirmed to be related to a novel coronavirus: known now as COVID-19. By the end of January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a global health emergency. Then, on Wednesday, the organization moved the status of the virus to a pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Since the first reported cases of the disease in Wuhan, there are now a total of <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\" target=\"_blank\">127,863 confirmed cases</a> (1,323 in the U.S.) and 4,718 deaths from the disease worldwide, according to John Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering.</p>\r\n <h3>What Is Coronavirus?</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">According to the WHO</a>, coronavirus is a family of viruses that cause a variety of illnesses, from the common cold to SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. These viruses are zoonotic, meaning that they pass from animals to people. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, the official name of the coronavirus currently spreading is COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Mild to severe respiratory issues</li>\r\n<li>Fever</li>\r\n<li>Cough</li>\r\n<li>Shortness of breath</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It is considered a novel virus, the word “novel” indicating that the virus is a previously undiscovered strain of coronavirus. It is a respiratory illness which spreads from person to person.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does It Spread?</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 appears to be highly transmittable. People can catch the virus from others who have the virus, even before the infected individual is showing symptoms. The disease can spread between people who are within six feet of each other, and through droplets created by an infected individual who coughs or sneezes. Although it is not the primary route, people can acquire the virus by touching an infected surface, followed by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>\r\n<p>An aspect of COVID-19 that may make it an especially spreadable virus is how it can transmit between people before the infected individual even shows any symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms are mild, so the infected individual may spread the virus before realizing they are sick. The <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001737?query=featured_home\" target=\"_blank\">New England Journal of Medicine</a> reported that COVID-19 is at peak infectiousness just as the individual begins to feel sick.</p>\r\n<h3>Who Is at Risk for Severe Illness From Infection?</h3>\r\n<p>Those over the age of 60 and people who have chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, and cancer are at a greater risk of developing severe symptoms from COVID-19. For those over the age of 80, the mortality rate stands at 15%, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173157/coronavirus-health-effects-age-covid-risk-diabetes-hypertension-disease-isolation” target=\"_blank\">WHO report that pooled over 72,314 cases in China</a>. That said, it is difficult to accurately identify all of the factors that leave people susceptible to developing serious illness at this time.</p>\r\n<p>There appears to be no evidence that children are more likely to catch the disease. Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/children-faq.html\" target=\"_blank\">the CDC reports</a> that severe complications from COVID-19 in children are uncommon. However, disease spreading can happen quicker among children because of frequent exposure to germ-rich areas like schools. The CDC also recommends that parents teach their children to have good hygiene practices and keep them up to date on all vaccinations.</p>\r\n<h3> What COVID-19 is Like and When to See a Doctor</h3>\r\n<p> Researchers found that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150748\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 99% of individuals</a> developed signs of COVID-19 within 14 days of initial infection. The severity of the symptoms depends partly on the person’s immune system and age; however, those infected may experience respiratory symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath. Additionally, the virus may induce a fever. Cases can present symptoms that range from mild to severe.</p>\r\n<p>Health care professionals recommend that those who are sick with any illness like the cold or flu stay home. If a fever accompanies the symptoms progress and, they recommend you call your healthcare provider. If you have symptoms after recently traveling to an area infected with COVID-19, or have come in close contact with someone who has the virus, the CDC recommends you find help from a medical professional.</p>\r\n<h3>How to Prevent the Spread of Covid-19</h3>\r\n<p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the WHO recommends for you stay home if you are ill. It is critical to follow other guidelines like covering your mouth with the crease of your elbow when coughing and sneezing into disposable tissues.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth, as the virus can enter the body this way. Unless you have COVID-19, or are caring for a person with a suspected COVID-19 infection, the WHO does not recommend wearing a facemask.</p>\r\n<p>The WHO does recommend washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water. People should also maintain social distancing, maintaining at least three feet of distance between yourself and other people.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, stay informed on the ongoing development of COVID-19 and contact your personal healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about how to protect yourself from COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

The question is no longer &#8220;will it hit your neighborhood.&#8221; Now, you should be asking &#8220;by when.&#8221; Like many others, you would probably like to know what to do when handling day-to-day situations to avoid infection. </p>\r\n<p>Among an onslaught of questions we hear, one that appears often is whether it is safe to even go outside. Here are a few tips other medical professionals are offering in regard to this question.</p>\r\n<h3>Preventing the Illness</h3>\r\n<p>It is important to note that during an outbreak of COVID-19, the main focus of a lockdown is to slow the spread of it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, states that <a href= \"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html\" target=\" _blank\">COVID-19 is spread</a> &#8220;Between people who are in close contact with one another,&#8221; and &#8220;Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&#8221;\r\nThe CDC adds that many places where a large number of people gather may shut down during a lockdown. This can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Community centers</li>\r\n<li>Schools</li>\r\n<li>Offices or places of work</li>\r\n<li>Movie theaters</li>\r\n<li>Large events/gatherings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img src=\"/blogimg/exercise-caution-corvid-inline.jpg\" alt=\"Be careful in large crowds or parks\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1987\" />\r\n\r\n<p>So, while going outside will not immediately mean a person contracts COVID-19, that does not mean that people should spend too much time outside. In fact, limiting one&#8217;s time outside can help decrease the risk of contracting COVID-19 from another person. Unless there is a national warning to remain indoors put into effect, people can go outside when absolutely necessary.</p>\r\n<h3>Steps to Take When Outside</h3>\r\n<p>Even though people are able to go outside, there are precautionary steps people can take to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p><b>Frequently Wash Hands with Soap and Water</b></p>\r\nThe <a href= \"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html\" target=\" _blank\">United States Department of Labor</a> and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration gives details on controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the office space. The Department of Labor states that regardless of specific exposure risks, it is crucial to &#8220;Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>This advice not only applies to employees in the workspace but to people of all ages in any setting. It is crucial to wash the hands and decrease the risk of contracting the condition.</p>\r\n<p><b>Avoid sharing food or drinks</b></p>\r\n<p>Whether someone is going out for a meal or with friends, do not share food or drinks. The CDC states that &#8220;Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms.&#8221; People who do not display signs of COVID-19 can still be contagious. Avoid sharing food and drinks to decrease the chance of spreading it.</p>\r\n<p><b>Clean surfaces when in public</b></p>\r\n<p>Before using a surface, such as a table at a restaurant or bench at a park, it is crucial to keep the surfaces clean. Ensure the surface was wiped down before using it to prevent the risk of interacting with germs and potential areas that are contaminated with the virus.</p>\r\n<p><b>Avoid large community events and gatherings</b></p>\r\n<p>In many cases of a virus such as COVID-19 spreading, public gatherings and events may close down. Schools may close to prevent the risk of the virus spreading through children. Community centers, churches, movie theaters, and more may temporarily close. In the cases of colleges closing, some may have students work from home.</p>\r\n<p>Place of employment may do the same thing, choosing to have employees complete work remotely and not come into the office.</p>\r\n<h3>Seek the Information You Need</h3>\r\n<p>When it comes to your health, it is crucial to seek information from a credible source. If you have any concerns about COVID-19, reach out to your medical professional for more information. While outside, exercise caution in interaction with other people and limit the amount of time you spend outside. It is important to note that protocol for dealing with COVID-19 and going outside may change in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Review credible online sources and news stations for current updates. If you believe that you or a loved one has symptoms, contact your medical provider for instructions on treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

However, they may change their mind and find another practice when they are not greeted with adequate customer service.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the text below, we delve deeper into how proper phone etiquette has the power to book more new patients and earn more referrals for your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Critical Importance of Front Desk Staff</h2>\r\n<p>The front desk serves as the communication hub of your practice. Patients typically spend more time interacting with the support staff at a medical practice than anyone else. In many ways, the waiting room influences patient engagement more than the exam room. Only four percent of <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/patients-no-1-complaint-front-desk-staff.html\">patient complaints</a> focused on the quality of medical care, with 96 percent of complaints related to customer service.</p>\r\n<h3>Impact on Patient Perception of Practice</h3>\r\n<p>Patient satisfaction affects your ratings with insurance plans, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/online-reputation-management\">online reviews</a>, and the likelihood that patients will return. When it comes to satisfaction, patients focus on <a href=\"https://www.medicaleconomics.com/business/3-ways-improve-patient-experience?utm_source=bibblio_recommendation\">a few key areas</a>, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Poor experiences with office staff</li>\r\n\t<li>Impersonal interactions, where they feel more like a number than a person</li>\r\n\t<li>Scheduling difficulties</li>\r\n\t<li>Poor communication with the practice</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Unsatisfied patients are less likely to remain at the practice. One survey reports at least a third of patients would switch to another provider after just one negative experience with the office staff.</p>\r\n<h3>Influence on Patient Referrals</h3>\r\n<p>When patients have an unpleasant experience with a service provider or company, then they are more inclined to speak poorly about that service provider and not likely to make a referral. In a recent industry survey, <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/patient-engagement-health-care-consumer-survey.html\">39 percent</a> of respondents said a practice&#8217;s reputation is one of the top four factors considered when looking for a new doctor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother one-fourth listed a friend or family member&#8217;s recommendation and 20 percent cited high user reviews as deciding factors. Patients&#8217; opinions of your practice, then, play a critical role in gaining new patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Suggested Best Practices to Improve Patient Experience</h2>\r\n<p>Many opportunities for improvement exist. One often overlooked area is how your practice answers (or does not answer) phone calls. As the first entry point into a practice for most patients, your phone system plays an important role. Inefficiencies and inadequacies in your phone system can lead to caller irritation, staff frustration, lost calls and lost patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Availability of Live Person to Answer Calls Promptly</h3>\r\n<p>Even as more healthcare interactions move online, 88 percent of healthcare appointments are still made over the phone. Phone calls should be answered by a live person. If someone calls your office during typical business hours (Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., which allows for busy people to make calls before or after work, or during a lunch break), staff should be available to answer that call. If someone is calling to schedule a first appointment, reaching voicemail instead of a person may lead to that potential new patient simply calling another practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Training of Front Desk Staff</h3>\r\n<p>All staff in your practice require customer service skills, but your front desk and phone answering staff especially need the proper training. They need to understand the important role they play in the patient experience and your expectations when engaging with the public. Courteous language, a friendly demeanor, and a patient-centric orientation are some of the training topics needed.</p>\r\n<h3>Greetings to Use When Answering the Phone</h3>\r\n<p>While answering the phone is essential, how the staff answers the phone is even more so. If staff are abrupt, speak with a flat tone, or act rudely, then patients will feel unwelcome. The greeting staff use when answering a phone call is influential. Scripts can be helpful in guiding staff on proper phone etiquette.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, here is an <a href=\"https://www.dentaleconomics.com/practice/patient-communication-and-patient-financing/article/14039590/dental-practices-must-make-a-good-impression-with-friendly-phone-etiquette\">outstanding greeting</a>: &#8220;Thank you for choosing Premier Dental. This is Paula. With whom am I speaking? Hello, Stephanie. How may I assist you today?&#8221; This greeting thanks the caller for choosing your practice. Giving and getting names forms a personal connection. The last sentence provides a patient-centric, service orientation and projects a professional image.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst impressions matter. Don&#8217;t let your first also be your last.</p>","date":"October 3, 2019","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Practice Management"}],"author":{"name":"Doctor Genius Marketing"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/7887283252a234d4aaaea274a59e4595/47498/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7887283252a234d4aaaea274a59e4595/9dc27/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg 300w,\n/static/7887283252a234d4aaaea274a59e4595/4fe8c/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg 600w,\n/static/7887283252a234d4aaaea274a59e4595/47498/practice-receptionist-on-phone.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"}}},"id":"9f756e48-5282-5f5b-8fc1-49bae3f8aa2b"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":["Marketing and branding do wonders for bringing potential patients to your practice.
