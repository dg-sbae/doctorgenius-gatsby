Your practice must stand out on the internet to do well in a competitive industry. Establishing trust with your audience is a great way to stand out from the competition. One way to build this trust is by including your affiliation with an organization. This information provides trust signals that can contribute to more page views and clients.</p>\r\n<h2>The Benefits of Listing Professional Affiliations</h2>\r\n<p>It is important to list the professional organizations a company is affiliated with when creating a webpage for a practice. Listing this information can improve conversion numbers by showcasing professionalism and providing examples of personal endeavors. Doing this will help establish audience trust and help boost website search results. It is easy to create content that speaks to one&#8217;s affiliations.</p>\r\n<h3>Website SEO Content</h3>\r\n<p>A website is the first impression many potential clients have of a practice. It should provide responsible and engaging content that relates relevant information to the audience without being overwhelming. While it is effective to list professional affiliations in the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section of the website, it is also beneficial to incorporate them in <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly/\">regular blog posts</a> to boost SEO-driven hits.</p>\r\n<h3>Approval and Endorsement From a Professional Organization</h3>\r\n<p>Many people start searches with a query about fixing a problem. Creating blogs about the services a practice offers to solve those problems can help with ranking. One can easily integrate an organizational affiliation into those blogs by highlighting any organization-approved methods or products used in treatments or services. Creating blog posts about industry news and the organizations relevant to it can also help raise one&#8217;s profile. The website can also include any practice-specific news. For example, if the <a href=\"https://www.aaoinfo.org/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.aaoinfo.org/\">American Association of Orthodontists</a> endorses the office, highlighting this membership can increase reliability rating with readers.</p>\r\n<h3>Affiliation With Charitable Organizations</h3>\r\n<p>The practice should also list any affiliations with charitable organizations. Information about volunteering with organizations like Operation Smile or Easterseals can also help practice ranking. Showing how practice members lent their time and skills is another way organizational affiliation can build audience trust. Blog posts about practice involvement in charitable organizations are another excellent way to get more website hits and include affiliate links to the relevant sites.</p>\r\n<h2>We Know SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Listing an affiliation with a professional organization is important for SEO.

Virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana, Alexa, and Google Home have become increasingly prevalent and staple in many people’s lives. It is not uncommon for people to have several virtual assistants integrated with their smart devices like home systems, mobile devices, cars, smartwatches, and even television remotes. Here are some tips and insights to help your practice be one of the first options when someone uses a voice search.</p>\r\n<h2>Choosing the Right Keyword Phrases for Virtual Assistants</h2>\r\n<p>Keywords are the foundation of all SEO. Various factors determine a webpage’s ranking. However, performing keyword research and implementing these phrases into a website’s content is much more likely to get higher on the SERP. It is important to note that the keywords that are successful in online search engines are not always the same for voice search.</p>\r\n<h3>Considering Natural Speech</h3>\r\n<p>One of the most effective ways one can increase their practice’s ranking for voice search is by understanding the difference between the way people speak and the way people write. People are much more likely to use fragmented phrases when searching for content on a mobile device or computer. In this case, short-tail keywords can be more successful. On the other hand, people often speak in complete sentences, even when talking to a virtual assistant, as speaking out loud is easier and quicker than typing.</p>\r\n<p>The content should include long-tail keyword phrases formatted like a question to improve the voice search SEO. Instead of optimizing for a short phrase like “root canal treatment,” include a long-tail keyword like, “Where can I get a root canal treated?” People will often include more context when using voice search, which pulls up different results than a more general search inquiry.</p>\r\n<h3>FAQ Pages</h3>\r\n<p>An effective method to incorporate more questions into a website’s written content is by including FAQs. Having a designated <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/best-faq-page-examples/267709/#close\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/best-faq-page-examples/267709/#close\">FAQ page</a> is one way to do this. One can also structure blog posts and other page content into a question and answer format by turning primary headers into questions. For instance, instead of using the header, “Types of Clear Aligners,” a website can use “What Are the Different Types of Clear Aligners?” The following section would then aim to answer that question.</p>\r\n<h3>Prioritizing Local SEO</h3>\r\n<p>While local SEO is essential regardless of the search method used, voice search is more likely to be tailored to the location. Virtual assistants and mobile devices are often linked, so information about the user like search history, preferences, and location is known. People often use Siri or other AI technologies to search for activities, restaurants, and stores nearby. It is important to focus on the local audience, as few people will travel far outside the city they reside or work in to seek care.</p>\r\n<p>Using location-specific keywords can increase the chances someone will see one practice before another. People also often ask a general query like, “Where is a chiropractor near me?” In this case, it would be beneficial to use a keyword phrase like, “Where is a dentist in Spokane?”</p>\r\n<h3>Google My Business</h3>\r\n<p>Having a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\">Google My Business</a> listing and making sure that it is up to date can help local keyword phrases lead people to a business. This listing should have relevant info like the address, phone number, category, and business hours. Google My Business also gives patients a platform to leave reviews, photos, and questions. The account&#8217;s success can have a significant impact on SEO ranking for virtual assistants.</p>\r\n<h3>Ranking for Different Virtual Assistants</h3>\r\n<p>Each virtual assistant has its own set of criteria to consider for ranking. Not all virtual assistants use the same search engine to pull results when someone uses voice search, so they may need to consider optimizing content for more than one. Most businesses primarily focus on Google, the primary search engine for Google Home, Android devices, and Siri. However, Bing is the default search engine for both Alexa and Cortana. Although users can ask most virtual assistants to use a different search engine, many do not. Taking the time to understand and optimize content for multiple search engines can help a website better reach more users.</p>\r\n<p>It can be challenging to rank any products that one&#8217;s practice might sell on Alexa. As Alexa is an Amazon product, it prioritizes Amazon Choice items or suggests items similar to the searcher’s previous purchases. If the search query does not have an Amazon Choice item, Alexa will provide the top search result that is Prime eligible. There is no way to apply for being an Amazon Choice product. Prime eligible products have a high rating, are bought often, have a low return rate, and are in stock and ready to ship.</p>\r\n<h2>Get Your Practice Seen and Heard</h2>\r\n<p>With so many factors to consider for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/just-magic-seo-services-doctor-genius\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/just-magic-seo-services-doctor-genius\">SEO</a>, it can be challenging for your practice to reach its entire audience.

It differs from traditional SEO in that you do not optimize your website for these key terms but rather optimize the authoritative site for them. Here is why you would want to do this.</p>\r\n<h2>The Concept Behind Barnacle SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Barnacle SEO is a term to describe a relationship similar to one that occurs in the natural world. In nature, barnacles will attach themselves to a moving object, such as a whale, so that they may drift along with the whale through the current and catch whatever nutrients come by. In turn, the barnacles provide the whale with something akin to a suit of armor. This concept works the same regarding big and small websites.</p>\r\n<h3>Using Other Sites To Improving Ranking</h3>\r\n<p>On its own, a small website has little to no chance of ranking for the industry’s most competitive key terms. It would be a significant drain on one&#8217;s resources to try to. Fortunately, sites are available that easily rank for those keywords that one can attach their brand’s name to benefit from their authority. Two of the biggest “whales,” so to speak, are Google and Yelp. However, there are other useful sites to which a brand can attach their name to. Some of these sites can serve a practice better than Google or Yelp. For instance, health practitioners may also want to <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/using-doctor-ratings-sites#1\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/using-doctor-ratings-sites#1\">look into niche sites</a> like Vitals and Healthgrades.</p>\r\n<h3>A Google Business Profile</h3>\r\n<p>A Google Business Profile is vital for SEO since it helps gain search engine visibility and gives businesses a better chance of appearing in local Google Search results and Google Maps. A Google My Business account allows one to claim ownership of their Business Profile and make changes to it. Making changes and updating information to ensure it is accurate creates an optimized profile that helps it rank for local and competitive keywords.</p>\r\n<h3>Yelp Matters</h3>\r\n<p>As the largest local review site next to Google+ Local, Yelp matters a lot. Yelp pages often show up at the top of Google for even generic terms like doctor, dentist, and chiropractor. Yelp results also feature ratings, which heavily influence conversions. The site also influences Google and Bing behind the scenes, meaning that a strong Yelp profile with many reviews can cause either of the search engines to show a profile before others.</p>\r\n<h2>Supporting Your Barnacle SEO Efforts</h2>\r\n<p>Google and Yelp<a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\"> can support your barnacle SEO efforts</a> in unique ways. Google can boost your local SEO, while Yelp can influence search engines and consumers.
