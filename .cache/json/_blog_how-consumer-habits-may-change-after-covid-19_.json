Some of the changes are<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic maintaining an ongoing status, consumer behavior seems to have changed overnight. Some of the changes are only temporary. However, others might become permanent. Businesses must adapt to these changes to serve consumers. Dental practices and businesses that adapt are likely to excel after the crisis.</p>\r\n<h2>Expected changes after the COVID-19 crisis</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a psychological change in consumers. Fear and anxiety drive people. Americans have concerns about products and businesses in ways never experienced before. The crisis has forced people to interact with businesses in new ways, as well.</p>\r\n<p>This crisis has changed customer preference. Many expect the psychological impact to last for the long term. By learning about the expected changes, practices can help to accommodate the needs of customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Technology-enabled solutions are the new normal</h3>\r\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has made consumers turn to technology more to meet their needs. Consumers use technology to shop for groceries, order food, stay connected with people, and more. With the pandemic, patients are now relying on technology to remain in contact with medical professionals, financial situations, and more.</p>\r\n<p>Many people tried online services for the first time during the pandemic. Consumers are likely to continue using technology to aid in everyday tasks. This could create an increase in curbside pickup and grocery delivery, for example. Due to this, it is crucial for medical professionals to utilize online systems.</p>\r\n<h3>Demand for product transparency</h3>\r\n<p>Health and safety will remain a top priority after the pandemic is under control. This will cause more consumers to demand transparency before choosing products. In the past, consumers often believed what companies told them about products. The pandemic has forever changed that. One reason for that is what consumers discovered about hand sanitizer during the outbreak.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html\">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, explains the effects of hand sanitizer on COVID-19. Many consumers relied on hand sanitizer to fight the coronavirus. Then, people found out that products with less than 60% alcohol are not effective. Consumers realized they need to research products to ensure they are effective. Otherwise, products might not deliver on a company’s promise.</p>\r\n<p>Health and safety demands will continue. Consumers will need more transparency from companies. That includes research that proves that products work. Companies that cannot provide this information might have trouble generating revenue.</p>\r\n<h3>An increase in preventive medicine</h3>\r\n<p>The emphasis on health and safety will go beyond consumer-buying habits. Consumers are also expected to make preventive care a priority after the crisis is over. This priority branches to doctor and dental visits that help them stay healthy. Some people skip their annual exams. That is expected to be rare in the coming years, though.</p>\r\n<p>Consumers might not see doctors and dentists the traditional way. The coronavirus crisis has created a boom for telemedicine and teledentistry. Many expect it to continue well after the virus is under control. Many dentists, physicians, and consumers appreciate the ease of telemedicine and teledentistry. It makes it easier to monitor patients and provides consultations.</p>\r\n<h2>Embrace the changing landscape after COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 will have a lasting impact on consumers and the businesses that serve them. Americans understand that life can change on a dime. People are more involved in the products they buy and the care they receive. Businesses, including dental and medical practices, must make changes to meet these demands. Those that do so will meet the needs of consumers and might even enjoy an increase in revenue in the coming year.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Uncertainty hangs in the air as the stock market takes<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/times-of-uncertainty-can-create-value-for-your-customers-in-new-and-necessary-ways/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the entire world into a crisis. Uncertainty hangs in the air as the stock market takes a plunge, oil prices go into free fall, and several businesses panic, not knowing what to expect. The fact is, uncertainty is a constant element. It is always there, and like the weather, it is out of people&#8217;s control.</p>\r\n<p>At this stage, businesses have two options to either get swept up by the uncertainties or take charge and innovate to create value for their customers in new and important ways.</p>\r\n<h2>Handling Uncertain Times as a Business Owner</h2>\r\n<p>During uncertain times, leaders are bound to make reflexive decisions such as halting hiring, reducing investments, cutting marketing and brand investments, and even ceasing decisions completely. These defensive measures are entirely reasonable and may even be necessary for survival in these uncertain times.</p>\r\n<p>However, they could be counterproductive in the short and long term. Such decisions could also put companies at a disadvantage in the aftermath of the crisis when situations improve.</p>\r\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\r\n<p>An effective solution is to adopt the right approach and mindset. Instead of reacting instinctively to the news and situation resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, businesses can act quickly and proactively to change their path and follow another. This path can include focusing on new and innovative ways to add value to their customers. Ultimately, when it comes to value, prospective customers are the ones who can determine what counts as value and what does not.</p>\r\n<p>To create value, business owners need to understand how their customers define value and how they can meet those demands. This means understanding how the current situation is affecting them and thinking innovatively. Customers often have major considerations about value, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cost impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Revenue impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Risk impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Value impact</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Cost impact</b></p>\r\n<p>Customers want to cut down on unnecessary expenses. When developing new solutions, business owners need to consider how much money their customers will save by recognizing and adopting the change over the status quo.</p>\r\n<p><b>Revenue impact</b></p>\r\n<p>The value proposition should offer potential customers an opportunity to increase their revenue. They will be more willing to adopt changes if ignoring the new value offering means that they might miss out on potential revenue.</p>\r\n<p><b>Risk impact</b></p>\r\n<p>When thinking of new ways to deliver value, business owners should look for ways to mitigate or eliminate risk factors that customers may face with the current products or services.</p>\r\n<p><b>Value impact</b></p>\r\n<p>New values should help customers achieve their goals faster and more reliably. This also means allowing customers to realize the impact of adopting new values on functional, corporate, and personal goals.</p>\r\n<h2>Stay Informed</h2>\r\n<p>Business owners need to understand what drives the value determination of their customers and key stakeholders. This also means assessing and exposing the costs, limitations, and risks associated with their present situation. It demands carefully aligning with the most critical aspects of the purpose, approach, and capabilities of the business with the things that matter or are valuable to the customers. With the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, now is the time to get innovative and create new and necessary value.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

It is also an economic crisis, with<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/new-irs-guidelines-from-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Businesses and individuals have realized that COVID-19 is more than a health crisis. It is also an economic crisis, with people and businesses around the country feeling the sting of lost wages and revenue. The IRS has stepped in to lessen the pain by providing some guidelines for individuals and businesses. These new guidelines will help Americans find steady footing during these uncertain times.</p>\r\n<h2>COVID-19 and tax guidelines</h2>\r\n<p>Most people are aware that the IRS extended the deadline to file taxes to July 15, 2020. What many do not realize is that this is just the tip of the iceberg regarding IRS guidelines for the coronavirus pandemic. The IRS is making it easier for employers to pay employees, even those who cannot go to work due to COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the IRS has relaxed guidelines for those who need to take money out of retirement accounts. Learn more about how these guidelines impact individuals and businesses.</p>\r\n<h3>Employee retention credit</h3>\r\n<p>The Employee Retention Credit is one of the IRS’s most exciting offerings. Businesses of all sizes can apply for this credit. In order to qualify, businesses must meet one of two criteria. First, this credit is available to companies that have suspended by a government order as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, businesses with gross receipts that total less than 50% of what they were in the same quarter of the previous year are eligible.</p>\r\n<p>Companies can be eligible for a credit that is 50% of the qualifying wages, which are capped at $10,000. Employees can include the amount they pay in health care when applying for this tax credit. Once approved, employers can reduce employment tax deposits as a method of reimbursement. If employment taxes do not cover the full credit, the IRS can send direct payments. Then, companies can use the money to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<h3>Paid sick leave refundable credit</h3>\r\n<p>Employees who are sick need to stay home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The IRS has announced a paid sick leave refundable credit to ease the burden on employees and employers. Employees who cannot work due to COVID-19 can receive up to 80 hours of paid sick leave, and the employer receives a fully refundable tax credit. The IRS states that the tax credit also covers the Medicare tax and health care expenses the employer has paid.</p>\r\n<h3>Paid family leave refundable credit</h3>\r\n<p>With schools and childcare facilities shut down, parents are having a hard time getting to work. The IRS announced a paid family leave refundable credit for those who have to care for their children. Employees can take up to 10 weeks of paid family leave, and the employer receives a refundable tax credit. The credit includes health care expenses and the Medicare tax.</p>\r\n<h3>Early withdrawal penalty waived</h3>\r\n<p>Hopefully, people will not have to reach into retirement accounts for money during the coronavirus pandemic. Still, those who have been impacted by COVID-19 can withdraw up to $100,000 without paying the 10% early withdrawal fee. Taxpayers must claim the distribution when filing taxes. They can spread out over three years to avoid paying the full tax obligation at once. Also, those who pay the distribution back within three years will receive a refund on any taxes paid.</p>\r\n<h2>Let the system help you during the COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Worrying about your health and your finances is overwhelming. Fortunately, you do have some financial options to soften the blow of COVID-19. If your company is eligible for a tax credit, take advantage of it. These credits can help businesses stay afloat during this difficult time.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
