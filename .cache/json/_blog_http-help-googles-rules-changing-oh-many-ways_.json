Google’s Rules are Changing in Oh So Many Ways","slug":"http-help-googles-rules-changing-oh-many-ways","excerpt":"With Google’s new change, any HTTP website will display the message “Not Secure” on its pages. Similar to the Beatles,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/http-help-googles-rules-changing-oh-many-ways/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"With Google’s new change, any HTTP website will display the message “Not Secure” on its pages. Similar to the Beatles, many people feel their independence vanish in the haze with this latest update. A requirement that will force people to use HTTPS on Google Chrome leads to a complicated transition for many websites and companies.\r\n\r\n<h3>Heed the warnings</h3>\r\n\r\nIt is important to heed the warning Google sends out now since October 2017 is the month in which they will enact this change. While some people may wonder how big of an impact this will be, “I mean, how many people use the Google Chrome browser anyways?” As of November 2016, Google announced that there were over 2 billion active Chrome Browsers.\r\n\r\nWith so many people relying on the Chrome browser for a variety of reasons from searching for an answer to settle a debate to searching for a dentist in the local area, seeing “Not Secure” anywhere on the page will definitely push people away from clicking on the website. Any HTTP website will not be able to remove this warning unless the website upgrades to HTTPS.\r\n\r\nAnother reason professionals need to pay attention to this change is that Google will rank an HTTP or “Not Secure” website lower on the list than a HTTPS website. With ranking being on the line, professionals who have a website or are considering a website need to ensure their website is ready for the change. One way to ensure that everything works with the transition and does not decrease ranking is by seeking a professional service that has the tools and skill to keep up with the times.\r\n\r\n<h3>Don’t get left in the dust</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-700\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-29-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\"> The “S” in HTTPS is part of SSL, Secure Sockets Layer, and is the standard security technology to establish an encrypted link between a web server and browser, ensuring that all data between them remains private.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDoctor Genius does not just provide clients with a website that acts as an effective digital platform to reach potential patients, but we keep up with all of the changes Google throws our way.

In many cases, parents will have to push back dental checkups for their children or even cancel with no new appointment in sight. Another issue is reaching a greater base of potential patients through the proper channels. Fortunately, Doctor Genius offers the services to help with reaching potential patients.\r\n\r\n<h3>Consistent Content Rate</h3>\r\nKeeping a consistent rate of high-quality content on a website will help to keep the website active. Thus, Google will see that the website has new content on a regular basis and place it higher on a list of search results. When someone searches for “dentists near me,” Google will place active websites first over websites that do not have new content on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n<h3>Social Media Management</h3>\r\nAlong with consistently uploading new content to a website, clients also need to continue posting on social media platforms. Regular posts will help to appear on follower’s feeds, which in turn will allow other friends of those followers to see the posts. The posts can also lead back to the website and increase more new patients.\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">We can provide you with quality content and professional support to keep your website running effectively and smoothly.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-Sept-5-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-705\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-Sept-5-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-Sept-5-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-Sept-5-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Call Tracking System</h3>\r\nA call tracking system allows for professionals to monitor how many calls they receive from new patients or current patients. At Doctor Genius, we use this system to measure how many new patients a client has each month and determine the best method for bringing in more new patients.\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile First Website</h3>\r\nA mobile first website will respond to whatever device an individual is using and reorganize the site to match that screen. This way, if the individual is viewing the website on a smartphone, then it will appear to fit that screen correctly. This is crucial as smartphones are a common and essential technology of today.\r\n\r\n<h3>Service Pages with Keywords</h3>\r\nWe also provide clients with service pages that pertain to their area of medicine and services they offer. We create the custom content for these pages and ensure there is a proper amount of keywords to help the page rank higher in Google search results. During the process of creating a website for you, our Support Team will go over keywords that rank and pertain to your services.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

In June of 2017, Facebook reached 2 billion monthly users. Medical professionals who do not utilize social media are missing out on the chance to reach a greater number of patients in the digital landscape. However, professional social media accounts require constant management.\r\n\r\n<h3>The key to effective social media marketing</h3>\r\n\r\nWhile adults will seek out information about dentistry or other medical practice, it is no surprise that younger audiences will not. It is important to know how to use social media to reach your target audience. Having multiple accounts on social media platforms is crucial for medical professionals to reach people of various demographics and backgrounds.\r\n\r\nAfter all, HubSpot found that in 2017, 74 percent of people say they use Facebook for professional reasons. Keeping up multiple social media accounts from Facebook to Yelp, can become difficult with a busy schedule.\r\n\r\nHowever, the key to effective social media marketing is efficient social media management. For instance, a post about proper brushing techniques can contain hyperlinks that take the individual back to your website with more information.\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col m7\">\r\n<blockquote>Facebook, by far, sends a greater volume of readers to both short-form and long-form news. Overall, about eight-in ten user complete interactions with a news article via a social networking site come from Facebook (82% long-form and 84% short-form), while a much smaller portion come from Twitter (16% long-form and 14% short-form). –Pew Research Center, 2016</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col m5\"><img class=\"wp-image-673\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2.jpg 378w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2-300x294.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/study-Aug-22-blog-img2-177x174.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>\r\n</div>\r\nYou can have your target demographic reading more content on your website through the proper social media posts. At Doctor Genius, we know how to help reach out to the target audience that will respond best to your content.\r\n\r\n<h3>Keeping up constant posts</h3>\r\n\r\nSocial media accounts that do not keep up consistent posts will find fewer followers and views on their profiles. If you do not have someone to keep an active account, then it is less likely to drive traffic. Thus, having a company that specializes in social media management and marketing to help keep the updates going is a great benefit for your practice.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we will help clients by updating multiple accounts with active content to help them to reach more potential patients. With our services, we can help direct patients from social media to the active content on your website on top of multiple service pages. We will help customize the website to your requests while also ensuring effective content.\r\n\r\nBy seeking the services at Doctor Genius, you can focus on your practice and we can take care of your digital presence online.
