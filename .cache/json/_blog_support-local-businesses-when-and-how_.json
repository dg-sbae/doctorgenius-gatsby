When it comes to dental practices, patients still need dental treatment, urgent services, and information on what constitutes a dental emergency. It is the same way with all forms of medical care.</p>\r\n<p>People are wondering how and when to reach out to medical professionals or businesses for how and when they can seek services. While the government is taking the time to iron out the details of re-opening the economy, medical practices can benefit from understanding what is going to happen and what the plan is for small businesses.</p>\r\n<h2>When and how to support local businesses</h2>\r\n<p>Local businesses play essential roles in the nation’s economy. Communities grow and experience more innovations due to local establishments by creating jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities and support the community. They care about the community making the town stand out among others.</p>\r\n<p>Such businesses are dealing with financial strain currently and face uncertainty about the future. The following are ways to support local businesses during the COVID-19 crisis:</p>\r\n<h3>Order from local stores</h3>\r\n<p>For those who can afford to, it would certainly help if they tried their local stores or restaurants first when they need to buy something. Many restaurants now offer pickups and deliveries. Other places like the local toy store, spas, hair salon, hardware store, and childcare provider may not be selling from their physical stores, but they could be offering delivery and curbside pickup options.</p>\r\n<p>Buy gift cards or credit for future use from them. Some of these local stores may have adjusted their services to meet up demands in this period. For instance, local cleaners may now offer disinfecting services, and the toy store may have added homeschool supplies. For those who still have the financial means, it might help to keep paying workers like the hairstylist, nanny, and cleaners. They are usually hit the hardest because fewer people will be requesting their services.</p>\r\n<h3>Avoid refunds and continue subscriptions</h3>\r\n<p>Check online to see if any of the services are now available online. Service providers like tutors, personal trainers, yoga instructors, financial planners, coaches, music teachers, and lawyers — all of them can continue to render their services online via videos or online conferencing.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to pay for memberships and subscriptions, even if the services have been stopped temporarily. If payment has been sent for a canceled class, one may consider donating the money to the organization instead of requesting a refund. Alternatively, one can postpone booked services to a later date instead of canceling.</p>\r\n<h3>Share the services online</h3>\r\n<p>If a local business is offering special promotions or ideas, sharing it online might help increase its reach. Since local businesses do not often have great marketing efforts, their customers can help them share the news over social media. Those who are website designers, developers, or social media experts can render their services to local businesses without an online presence to promote their deals and sales online.</p>\r\n<h3>Give tips</h3>\r\n<p>When ordering takeaway goods from local restaurants, try to be more generous than usual, if possible. The extra funds, no matter how little, can help businesses and their staff who still have to work, as well as delivery people who typically work on a contract basis and have unstable wages.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us To Learn More Today</h2>\r\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and self-isolating rules are critical for curbing the spread of the disease but devastating for local businesses.

While working from home has its benefits, especially in terms of productivity, not every business can benefit from this setup. In fact, dentists and medical practices are finding themselves in unique situations.</p>\r\n<p>This is where Doctor Genius can help. Our goal is to help you utilize a practice website and digital platform to maximize your reach online while also helping patients when needed and allowed. For instance, many patients are unsure of what constitutes a dental emergency. Along with that, there are constant developments with teledentistry.</p>\r\n<p>With teledentistry, dentists can provide consultations to patients via video and voice chat, while they remain in their homes. However, it is essential for dentists to establish a work-home-life balance.</p>\r\n<h2>Work-Home-Life Balance</h2>\r\n<p>The key to finding a balance between work and daily routine lies in time management. The following tips help with time management and communication to make the day more productive:</p>\r\n<h3>Plan activities adequately</h3>\r\n<p>Specify the time for work. An alternative might be to stay flexible and divide time between work responsibilities and other tasks. It is advisable to inform colleagues of working hours for better coordination of work hours yet ensure effective collaboration. Identify long and short-term goals and meet set deadlines.</p>\r\n<p>Our team at Doctor Genius can help to outline how dentists can adjust to this new work format, and learn how to balance the new schedules. In some cases, practices may offer emergency or immediate dental services for severe issues.</p>\r\n<h3>Work in a different area from the rest of the home</h3>\r\n<p>Designate an “office space” that is solely dedicated to working. The workspace should be clean and free of clutters to prevent distractions. Everyone in the house should know about this space, so they know not to disturb throughout work hours. If there are kids around, parents can explain to them that sitting on a particular desk on an area means work, and they should only come around for important things. Letting family members understand the need to respect work time and space will allow healthy boundaries, regardless of the size of the workspace.</p>\r\n<h3>Adopt office routines</h3>\r\n<p>Working from home can affect productivity. Therefore, one can stick to the same work structure that exists in the office setting, including meetings with colleagues over video conferencing tools. This encourages a healthy routine to ensure productivity and successful work completion. The communication tools can promote relationships with colleagues, reduce loneliness, and preserve the team spirit. It would help to document work progress and share it with the rest of the team.</p>\r\n<h3>Create time for breaks</h3>\r\n<p>Working from home can make it hard to divide time between personal matters and work. There should be time for breaks to increase productively. Such breaks can be dedicated to favorite tasks such as exercising, cooking, or reading. Planning such activities provides something to anticipate after work. Exercises and mental breaks are important for health and well-being during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn More About Doctor Genius</h2>\r\n<p>The tips above emphasize the importance of maintaining a level of discipline and structure as the day passes. By forming habits that promote effective time management and communication skills, you will be able to create a balance between your work and personal life. These routines might be hard to follow at first, but with persistence, you can make the remote work enjoyable while the COVID-19 pandemic lasts.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

He has been working alongside our team to aid practices through this unprecedented time. With the legislators across the US lifting restrictions put in place during the pandemic, medical practices having a clear roadmap on how to proceed with reopening is paramount. Along with having the appropriate PPE, scheduling appointments with limited hours of operation, communicating with patients, and more, practices need to have a plan to rebuild their office for the present and in the future. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to have world-class talent like Bob Affleck ready to help practices create a plan to rebuild and restore. </p>\r\n<h2>What is Cash Flow Matters with Bob Affleck?</h2>\r\n<p>Our Cash Flow Matters webinar series strives to help dental and medical practice owners attain the practice growth and success they desire. When it comes to enhancing your practice, finances are a crucial aspect of your success. I>t&#8217;s also important to know what&#8217;s changed in financing since quarantine went into effect, which is why speaking to an industry expert can prepare you to seek improved cash flow.</p>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 20px;/* padding:20px!important; */margin:40px auto;width: 80%;font-size:1.2rem;\" class=\"btn btn-block btn-dark\"><a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/bobaffleck\" style=\"text-decoration:none;padding: 20px;width: 100%;height: 100%;display: block;\"><span style=\"\">Click Here</span><span style=\"color: white\"> to learn more about our program and how it can benefit your practice today!</span></a></div>\r\n<p><b><i>Who is Bob Affleck?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>Bob Affleck is a financial expert who has dedicated the past 30 years to helping thousands of dentists realize their dream of practice ownership and achieve the practice growth they desire. Cash Flow Matters is &#8220;Not just about running a practice but being able to grow the practice, as well.&#8221; With Bob Affleck, he explains that this is about helping practices &#8220;Make the comeback stronger than the setback.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>With experience as a practice finance specialist, a practice management consultant, and a practice broker, Affleck now works as an advisor and educator for dentists. With experience from the dental industry at all angles, Affleck has the expertise to help guide clients from the beginning of their career and onward.</p>\r\n<p><b><i>What Can the Cash Flow Matters Webinar do For Me?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>By working with Affleck, this webinar demonstrates to clients how refinancing is a crucial step, but it is only the first step. While most dental practices have been in survival mode for the last few months, it is essential to begin thinking past tomorrow. </p>\r\n<p>Following the refinancing, it is crucial to have a plan. Through this webinar, we can help clients take their practice from survive to thrive. That begins with a sound online presence fueled by relevant, high-quality content. The Cash Flow Matters Webinar will help you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li >Understand your current practice finances</li>\r\n\t<li >Refinance</li>\r\n\t<li >Rebuild</li>\r\n\t<li >Restore</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/\">Doctor Genius Practice Recovery Blueprint</a>, we go into detail on how Next Level Practice and Doctor Genius are partnered up to provide an opportunity for practice owners to bounce back.  This can help clients focus on reopening their practice. Now, we are delving more deeply into the aspects involving refinancing.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding Your Current Practice Finances</h2>\r\n<p>To help your practice grow and achieve the success you desire, it is essential to gain an understanding of your current finances. This includes reviewing all current practice loans, equipment loans, credit card debt, or other outstanding debt. We will also need to review the practice&#8217;s ongoing costs for PPE, staff, and monthly expenses. From here, we can better evaluate what your practice needs.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to understanding your current practice finances, we will focus on several areas, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li >Free up cash flows</li>\r\n\t<li >Rebuild cash reserves</li>\r\n\t<li >Invest in Health and Safety Equipment</li>\r\n\t<li >Invest in Marketing to Promote Safe Practice</li>\r\n\t<li >Drive Profitability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius works with Bob Affleck to help practices strengthen and build upon the resources they need while also promoting their message to their healthcare communities and their patients. By evaluating your current finances, together, we can help customize a loan plan for how to begin the process of building a more stable financial foundation for a  successful practice in the future.</p>\r\n<h2>Refinance</h2>\r\n<p>After understanding a client&#8217;s current finances, we can focus on refinancing. This process involves consolidating practice debt, freeing up cash flow, debt cash out, and other services we offer in our Recovery Blueprint plan.</p>\r\n<p><b><i>What will consolidating practice debt do for me?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>By organizing all unsecured debts into one monthly payment, we can help to establish the most effective payment system for it.  By using a loan to consolidate debt, you will be able to make one payment covering multiple debts instead of spending more time and resources keeping track of multiple payments. Affleck can help clients learn what they need in order to succeed.</p>\r\n<p><b><i>In what other ways will this benefit the future of my practice?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>In our most recent <a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/bobaffleck\">webinar</a>, Affleck states that his goal is to educate clients &#8220;on what it takes to grow the practice,&#8221; and that, to do this, the &#8220;<i>Most important part is about understanding the business side of the practice.&#8221;</i> We are here to help you do that and begin the process of rebuilding a firm financial foundation beneath your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Rebuild</h2>\r\n<p>Part of rebuilding a practice includes implementing a new message and marketing platform. This message can incorporate your beliefs and overall goal for your practice while targeting keywords that promote your services. Doctor Genius can combine your message with SEO-focused content to help boost the chance of people finding your website in internet searches. This can also include content that goes over new health and safety measures in a post-COVID-19 world.</p>\r\n<p>Content has been vital for keeping our clients engaged with their community during the pandemic. After completing a full performance audit on all Doctor Genius clients, our team found that they&#8217;ve been experiencing more visibility to their sites. We also found that people were enjoying and reading the content on our client&#8217;s websites to help them make informed decisions about their health. More people are reading blogs, spending more time on practice websites, and learning more about the services they need to make an informed decision. To continuously see positive results, it&#8217;s essential to understand the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">importance of social media, videos, and how to create effective blogs</a>. </p>\r\n<p><b><i>How do You market necessary dental care to patients in these trying times?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>A relevant concern patients have at this time is their safety when receiving dental care. We can help to promote any messages of having the proper equipment and taking all necessary measures to ensure the health of each patient. Your patients likely desire dental treatment even at this time; they just need the right message for them to feel comfortable returning.</p>\r\n<p><b><i>Can you customize the website to my specific services?</i></b></p>\r\n<p>Yes. Along with customizing the content to specific services, we can help to fine-tune your systems to promote profitability. Affleck is here to help clients maximize the potential of profit for their practice. By working with us to rebuild your practice, we can help place your practice on the path toward success.</p>\r\n<h2>Restore</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to helping restore a practice, the Cash Flow Matters Webinar focuses on strengthening practice efficiencies and experiences. Similar to sending out a personalized message for potential patients, your website can also send a reassuring message to staff members. The goal of restoring a practice is more than merely boosting revenue. This process can also help clients discover new patient opportunities and methods of delivering quality care to patients.</p>\r\n<p>If you are looking to restore your practice and begin working with a system that promotes more success in the future, then we can help.
