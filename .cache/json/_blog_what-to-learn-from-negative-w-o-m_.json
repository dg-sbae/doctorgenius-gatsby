While we at Doctor Genius like to think of ourselves as a team of forward-thinking individuals, we tend to agree. It is true that negative word-of-mouth marketing can have a damaging effect on customers’ perceptions of a brand and, therefore, the brand’s profits, but the truth is that <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/\">negative W-O-M is what you make of it</a>. If you do nothing about poor reviews or worse, try to hide from them, they will continue to haunt you. However, if you address them head-on and use them as learning mistakes, you can not only recover but can become better than you were before.</p>\r\n<h2>Negative W-O-M indicates loyalty</h2>\r\n<p>Back in 2011, LoyaltyOne, a Cincinnati-based company that provides loyalty marketing services to enterprises, announced a few <a href=\"https://customerthink.com/turning_a_frown_upside_down_how_negative_wom_can_help_your_brand/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://customerthink.com/turning_a_frown_upside_down_how_negative_wom_can_help_your_brand/\">changes to its AIRMILES Reward Program</a>. Among the changes was one that affected redemption requirements, which outraged many customers. While the brand fully expected some pushback, it was surprised by who was doing the pushback and why.</p>\r\n<p>According to the company’s reports, the most verbal (read: outraged) customers were those who the brand perceived to be their most valuable. These individuals were, on average, 70% more engaged with the rewards program than those who remained silent. The company realized that the negative comments stemmed from customers’ emotional connection to the brand that, prior to the program changes, was a positive one.</p>\r\n<h2>How to use negative W-O-M to your advantage</h2>\r\n<p>Regardless of who is posting negative comments about your practice, you can learn from LoyaltyOne’s response to the 2011 situation. In addition to monitoring customers’ responses throughout the entire commentary period, the brand also publicly clarified any inaccuracies and responded to specific questions. Its participation in the conversation offset the bad experience with a new, positive one. It also reinforced the brand’s core values that attracted the most engaged members in the first place. The overall result was that approximately one-third of outraged commenters ended up redeeming their points afterward.</p>\r\n<p>#1800Flowers is another major company from which you can learn, but unlike with LoyaltyOne, its experience teaches you what not to do. On February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2015, many 1-800-Flowers customers received wilted flower arrangements and half-crushed chocolates. Though the company has a long-standing reputation for delivering outstanding products, this single bad experience stuck with customers for months. Though it did issue a public statement apologizing for the incident, Spiegel Research Center suggests <a href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/news/1800flowersfail---negative-word-of-mouth-matters.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/news/1800flowersfail---negative-word-of-mouth-matters.html\">three other steps</a> it should have taken — and that you should consider if you fall victim to negative online marketing:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Create an opportunity for NWOM posters to re-experience your brand. </strong>Do not just issue a refund or apology. Provide the product or service again, but for free.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reach out to NWOM posters individually.</strong> So that those directly affected by your actions know that your apology is sincere and that you genuinely care about their opinions, reach out to them individually. Show that you are willing to listen, learn, and change.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Use negative W-O-M</strong> as an opportunity to participate in customer discussions and show followers that you take any complaints about your brand seriously.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Take control of your online reputation</h2>\r\n<p>As a leader in the online marketing space, Doctor Genius has the experience and know-how to help you overcome negative word-of-mouth through reputation management and a robust content strategy.

Search engine giants like Google have started using a salience score to analyze and prioritize search results. To understand how entity salience can help your website perform better in the result rankings and improve search engine optimization, you first have to learn what an entity is and how salience applies to it.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding natural language processing</h2>\r\n<p>Google and other sites use natural language processing to determine the overall meaning of text content on a webpage. This function is carried out by an artificial intelligence program to identify what a real human would find important in a block of text. You can improve content management by focusing on entity salience, though it is important to note that entity salience is not the same thing <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\">as SEO keywords</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Entities</h3>\r\n<p>An entity is usually a specific word in a text that references a noun. For example, a person, a business, a product, and even a number may be recognized as entities within a body of text. A natural language processing AI can identify entities even when they are not specifically named, like when a named person is mentioned again in nominal form. The identification of these entities is the first step toward building a salience score.</p>\r\n<h3>Salience</h3>\r\n<p>When referred to an entity, salience means exactly what its <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience\">Merriam-Webster</a> definition is: being especially noticeable or conspicuous. In text, entities that are salient are those words that the AI detects as being important or prominent to a real person. This does not necessarily mean that someone who reads a website’s content will pick up on all those words. The AI simply uses its estimation of salient entities to create a score of readability and SEO popularity.</p>\r\n<h3>The salience score</h3>\r\n<p>Several factors contribute to how these entities are identified through natural language processing. From a single block of text, an entity may be chosen because of its location in the text, its grammar, if it is linked to sections of the sentence, and how much it stands out. Again, names, nouns, and pronouns all get bonus points in the process. The distinction between entities and keywords is incredibly important to content writers, as a writer can work to incorporate an entity and keyword closely together so that they both rank higher together.</p>\r\n<h2>Calculating your salience score</h2>\r\n<p>Since salience scores are not yet fully popularized and it is not clear how much they may improve website SEO, finding a website to calculate your score can be difficult. Lexalytics and the Google Natural Language API Demo are both options where you can type in text and see how it ranks. By experimenting with different types of texts, you can discover what entities get identified the most and how to write content around salience and SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about salience scores for your website</h2>\r\n<p>There is still a lot that needs to be explored with entity salience. To learn more about how your business can benefit the most from these scores and how to incorporate them into your everyday content, <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">contact us</a> for information and guidance.   </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Until recently, many thought the on-demand economy would be a passing trend, directed toward the young and wealthy. However, recent data shows that is far from the case, with <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy\">30% of on-demand consumers</a> being between the ages of 35 and 54, and another 22% age 55 and older.</p>\r\n<p>As to be expected, the largest sector of the on-demand economy is online marketplaces. This is followed by transportation, with food and grocery coming in third. As a health care practitioner, you may assume you are not a part of this, but you would be wrong. On-demand health and beauty services account for $8.1 billion in consumer spending each year, and analysts anticipate spending will only grow with time. It is important that you adapt your content marketing strategy to accommodate this change and appeal to the on-demand market.</p>\r\n<h2>The power of listicles</h2>\r\n<p>While a strong content marketing strategy utilizes a variety of content types, consumers respond particularly well to lists and bullet points. The most popular women’s magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and Good Housekeeping have included listicles for decades.</p>\r\n<p>Listicles appeal to consumers’ need to lump things into round-numbered groups, a tendency that marketing scholars Robert M. Schindler and Mathew S. Isaac refer to as the “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1\">top 10 effect</a>.” According to the scholars, by lumping items into rounded numbered groups, such as “Top 10,” or “20 Best,” it becomes easier for consumers to process mass amounts of information quickly. Not only that, but it also helps them to make what they deem “more informed decisions” quickly.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, when a list details the “Top 10 On-Demand Health Care Services,” the 10 items within the list get particular notice. Consumers tend to consider other services that do not make the cut as “inferior.” This is true even of services that come in at number 11, even if the cause of that ranking is minimal or unknown. The impression most people get when viewing such a list is that if an item does not rank in the top 10, it is a level down.</p>\r\n<h2>What this means for your practice</h2>\r\n<p>According to Digital Journal, 30% of blog posts are lists, suggesting that you cannot go wrong with this format. In addition to aspiring to be a part of a Top 10 list by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">leveraging technology</a>, you should create lists of your own. At Doctor Genius, listicles are one of our go-to content formats for driving engagement and guiding readers through the sales cycle. On behalf of our clients, we create lists on everything from the top dental restoration procedures to ways patients can improve heart health to the benefits of clear braces.</p>\r\n<h2>Leverage listicles to boost your rankings</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we are familiar with the most effective strategies for marketing health care and dental practices online.
