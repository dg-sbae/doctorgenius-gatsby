This will grow your practice and gain patient referrals. If you don’t have a lot of time on your hands, don’t worry – most dentists don’t. Fortunately, these social media tips are so easy that you or your office manager can implement them in between patients. As a result, your organic marketing results will improve.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Write a value proposition.</strong> Update your cover image to include your value proposition so that users immediately know what you are about and how you can help them. For example, “healthy smiles for the entire family”. This will increase the likelihood of someone liking or following your Facebook page when they come across it.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Create a call-to-action.</strong> Content marketing is just as important in social media as it is for your website. Write content that inspires people to act, for example, “click here to read more”. While simple, this tip will increase how many clicks you get.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Build fans organically.</strong> It is okay if your Facebook fan page grows steadily over time. This is far better than purchasing a block of fake fans that don’t live near you and could never use your dental services. The power of organic marketing and social media is the ability to expose your practice to those that live within your local area. Focus on the objective, even if it is one fan at a time.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Create awesome blog posts.</strong> You should include blog writing in your content marketing strategy since it gives you the opportunity to share your knowledge, answer questions and provide information for prospective patients. The more often you blog, the higher your chances are for being viewed as a knowledge leader in the community. Through social media, you can posts your blogs and encourage users to read and comment. You can further tie it into your social media by telling people to ask any questions they have that weren’t answered by the blog post. This can increase your user engagement.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Keep it interesting.</strong> Use a variety of post types in order to keep it interesting for your followers. For example, post a video then a picture and a text post. You should also vary the type of content while always staying relevant to your business or community. As an added benefit, you can review your social media analytics to see what type of posts gets the best reaction from users. This will help you to cultivate a more effective organic marketing strategy.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Use interesting images.</strong> There are a variety of free apps that you can download to edit images. If you want to impose a text onto a photo and aren’t sure how, pull out your smartphone. Most of these will let you take a picture, impose text and post directly to Facebook. PicCollage is an easy one to use and completely free.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to improve your content marketing or social media, call and speak with a Dental SEO Sites representative.","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Practice Management"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/recentpost-02-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECBf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHrYsILP//EABoQAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhEhEjH/2gAIAQEAAQUCbobzwu1HVxGR/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARBB/9oACAEDAQE/AQ2f/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD/2gAIAQIBAT8BWf/EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAiEQEVGB/9oACAEBAAY/ArOlSUT3WLimf//EABoQAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQVH/2gAIAQEAAT8hMXgr2DbOqZgoD5Ub+c6bOtI7mDLSf//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQT9//xAAYEQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhUf/aAAgBAwEBPxC3A25P/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQAB/9oACAECAQE/EAywL//EAB0QAAICAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACFBUWFxofD/2gAIAQEAAT8Qe5bKivJ1CiAhpDW/uIFE43AL2FoB2C1cRECKWMQrtQRU/9k=","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/9dc27/recentpost-02-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/4fe8c/recentpost-02-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"a3feb621-2bd4-526a-8aa2-73f3bf8a1cff"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null},"prevPost":{"title":"What You Should Know About Call Tracking and SEO","slug":"what-you-should-know-about-call-tracking-and-seo","excerpt":"If you are unfamiliar with call tracking, this is a solution that is widely used by marketers to track which<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/what-you-should-know-about-call-tracking-and-seo/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"If you are unfamiliar with call tracking, this is a solution that is widely used by marketers to track which advertisements are making the phone ring. A call tracking number is a unique phone number that you can assign to a specific marketing campaign so that when you receive a phone call, you know which advertisement was effective and invest more resources towards it. Simultaneously, you can tell which campaigns were a dud. Call tracking numbers can also be used when you are testing landing pages or your website to determine which CTAs are generating results. The benefits of using a call tracking solution is that it provides you with the data you need to adjust your marketing strategy to improve your results.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to SEO, however, you need to be careful in how you use this solution. Particularly when it comes to your business listings. Your name, address, and phone number (NAP) should be the same so that the search engines view your listings as having accurate data. While it could be useful to know if you are getting calls off of your Google local business listing vs. your Bing local listing, the risk of splitting your citation equity may not be worth it.\r\n\r\nInstead, use call tracking numbers in ways that is effective and will not negatively harm your SEO. For example, when you are running an AdWords campaign, you can use call tracking numbers, Google extensions, or Google forwarding numbers. If you are running three ads, one with variations of the keyword “teeth cleaning”, another with “dental veneers”, and a third with “dental implants”, you could assign a unique tracking number to each one. That way if someone calls directly from your ad, you can tell which one led to offline conversions. That is the power of a call tracking number. Someone can see your information, pick up the phone, and you will know how they found out about you.\r\n\r\nYou can also use call tracking phone numbers on landing pages that you are optimizing. Many businesses do so when promoting a specific campaign. In the example of a local dentist, you may want to run a package promotion that offers dental implants at a discounted rate. Not wanting to lose full price business, a landing page can be used to advertise the promotion, attract new customers through organic SEO, and sell implants without disrupting normal business. In this case, a call tracking phone number should be used so that team members can tell how the customers came in contact with the dental office and offer the appropriately discounted rates.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit to call tracking comes from being able to test out the effectiveness of your website or of specific CTAs. By placing a unique phone number on each CTA, you can determine how far down the page people are reading and which offer or content leads them to act. Once you have finished testing your site, you can change the phone numbers back to the same one that is on your local business listings.\r\n\r\nThere are additional ways that call tracking numbers can be useful, including on offline advertising campaigns. When it comes to SEO, you should practice caution and be sure that your NAP is consistent across all platforms.

This represents a significant increase in the number of people conducting a local search, determined to connect with a business close by. This can benefit your dental practice by connecting you with a prospective patient that is in immediate need of your services.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Nearby Business Listings product</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>To capitalize on this growing trend, Google is offering a new advertising product. The Nearby Business Listings product replaces some of the typical ad copy with features that consumers use on a regular basis. Features like click-to-call and click-for-directions appear in the ad so that when someone is conducting a local search, they can find a nearby business and immediately connect with them. If the search is a mobile search, the convenience of immediately navigating to the business cannot be overstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a dentist, you should also consider how you can use this knowledge in your current marketing plans. As a company that specializes in optimizing for local search, we recommend that you check all of your online business listings to ensure that your information is accurate. Your name, address, phone number, and hours of operation need to be included with your business listings to ensure that someone can find you in a local search. Additionally, you should optimize your website for mobile users. We recommend building a responsive design website that adjusts based on the type of device that is being used to view it. This will allow your site to have built-in features like click-to-call or click-for-directions. Given how many people conduct a mobile search for a local dentist, this is an easy way to ensure that they call you instead of a dentist down the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneously, your website needs to be optimized for local search. When creating your SEO strategy, it is important to include your location in multiple places on your site. Think of the phrase that people will use when searching for a dental office in your area (or better yet – have us pull the analytics for you). For example, if you are in Orange County, California, do people search for an “OC dentist”, “Orange County dentist”, etc.? The terms and phrases that they would use should be incorporated into the content on your website, giving your site the opportunity to show up when someone does a local search for a “dentist nearby”. After all, the search engines know where you are located based on the information that you give them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can audit your website to ensure that it is mobile friendly and that you are optimized to show up in a local search. This way you can benefit from the increase in mobile searches for a dentist “near me”.</p>","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Digital Marketing"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/trend-04-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/a7715/trend-04-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/9dc27/trend-04-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/4fe8c/trend-04-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/a7715/trend-04-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"10d9bdca-af32-5803-a722-8325e9ef457e"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null}},"pageContext":{"currentNode":{"slug":"social-media-power-tips-for-dentists","wordpress_id":225},"currentID":225,"prevNode":{"slug":"what-you-should-know-about-call-tracking-and-seo","wordpress_id":215},"prevID":215,"nextNode":{"slug":"local-searches-are-on-the-rise-2","wordpress_id":222},"nextID":222}}
