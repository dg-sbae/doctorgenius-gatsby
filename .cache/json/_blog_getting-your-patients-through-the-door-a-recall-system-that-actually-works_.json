You need to have patients who will return for checkups after the initial visit. A strong Recall System will allow you to establish strong bonds of trust with the patient as a professional practice and ensure Patient Recall. While professionals can attempt to schedule appointments months ahead, the patient may move to another practice or cancel the appointment. Doctor Genius is hosting a webinar event for clients to learn new tips and methods for an improved Patient Recall System.\r\n<h3>The webinar event you don’t want to miss</h3>\r\nPatient Recall is a crucial step of anyone’s practice and not having an effective system in place can hinder the chance of patients returning. We will cover tips and methods for developing an effective Patient Recall System that will help retain patients and bring more through the doors. The webinar event will take place from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017.\r\n\r\nA few simple steps that are essential for effective patient recall include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Phone call reminders for a regular dental checkup</li>\r\n \t<li>Sending postcards with practice contact info to patients with reminder</li>\r\n \t<li>Creating an automated recall system</li>\r\n \t<li>Adding patients who do not reply to all reminders onto an overdue recall list</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhile many professional practices may pre-schedule the phone, email, or postcard reminders about an appointment, patients may still end up canceling. This webinar will cover how to implement effective recall methods into a practice.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-312\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>New recall tactics from a professional consultant</h3>\r\nProfessional consultant, David Orr, owner of Alliance Dental Consulting in Irvine, CA, works to understand and develop dental practices to help them reach greater levels of success. Orr will share tips on his confirmation system with listeners during the webinar.\r\n\r\nThe confirmation system begins by sending a card in the mail or an email to the patient 28 days before the appointment, requesting confirmation. Since some patients may not respond immediately, consistency is key. Orr will also cover steps with basic recall, overdue recall, responding to missed appointments, unscheduled treatment and more. Orr will go over how to effectively continue keeping up contacting with the patient and increasing patient recall with his system in the webinar.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we produce professional content for dental practices and help practices create a stronger online presence.

The digital marketing landscape for healthcare is not as simple as posting a single comment on Facebook or sharing a special discount on Twitter. Navigating the digital marketing landscape can be more difficult than some might believe. To have success, a healthcare practice or company needs to be able to evolve with a constantly changing market.\r\n<h3>Times, they are a changing</h3>\r\nA strong online presence may not completely ensure a strong flow of patients or consumers, but it can increase the probability of reaching more patients through digital marketing. Business Insider cites a report from Custora that finds that “Organic search results accounted for 21 percent of US e-commerce orders,” in the first quarter of 2016, “representing the highest share of all marketing channels.”\r\n\r\nWhile searching online can produce a large variety of results, professionals can rank higher with the proper online presence. However, an online presence may not stand out among other practices in the digital landscape without other methods of creating a strong digital presence. Here are a few helpful hints to better navigate the digital marketing landscape when it comes to healthcare.\r\n<h3>A strong Call-to-Action</h3>\r\nA private practice needs to have an obvious Call-to-Action or “Why-to-Buy,” on the website. As simple as this might sound, a website that does not have a phone number or efficient forms of communication will lose clients. By having an easy means of communication, a reason that the client should seek the service and patient forms available on the website, the practice will help motivate people to seek their service.\r\n<h3>An easily-readable home page</h3>\r\nThe first page of a website that a potential patient lands on is a crucial factor for the individual remaining on the website or seeking information elsewhere. In many cases, a home page can share a possible deal the practice is currently offering or break down the main service of the company in easy-to-read and understandable forms. The patient needs to be able to understand the content at a quick glance, comprehend it and then decide if it is what he or she needs. The home page needs to direct people to other pages within the website that offer more details on the desired search result.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-320\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>An active social media presence</h3>\r\nWhile a social media presence on its own will not drastically increase the number of patients for a practice, it can greatly increase the number of possible patients. In a survey of over 1500 American adults, Pew Research Center finds that “Nearly eight-in-ten online Americans,” around 79 percent, use Facebook over other forms of social media. The same study finds that 24 percent use Twitter, 31 percent use Pinterest, while 32 percent use Instagram. Having a strong social media presence is an incredibly beneficial method for reaching consumers and potential patients. While these are only a few hints, there are plenty more available through our services.\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their private practice or business by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into patients to their practice doorstep.
