Due to this fact, it is important for medical professionals to build a strong online presence that reaches potential patients. This is where Doctor Genius comes in.</p>\r\n<h3>Connecting patients to doctors</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, our main goal is to help you expand your practice through online marketing. We can help healthcare practitioners expand their patient base, boost brand awareness and help doctors build trustworthy connections with patients that serve as a ladder to sustainable practice growth. To help attract and retain new patients at your practice, we utilize the effectiveness of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Digital media</li>\r\n\t<li>Social marketing</li>\r\n\t<li>Online reviews</li>\r\n\t<li>Quality referrals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can monitor all of this through an online portal that displays the factors of your growth and website activity. Our team has the skills and expertise to utilize these tools and help your practice display in Google searches. We understand how to utilize website text and marketing to help your practice be near the top of Google results lists when a patient searches for services within your medical field.</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">To help summarize our services and overall goal, here is a video about Doctor Genius.</blockquote>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cgXsqix8tE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h3>An effective website across multiple devices</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that people use different devices of varying sizes from smart-phone screens to desktop computers. The PEW Research Center finds that as of January 2017, nearly 77 percent of Americans own a smartphone and that around 9 in 10 Americans are regularly online. With this in mind, most people will probably use smartphones, tablets or laptops to conduct any form of web searches. Thus, you need a website that will properly display on any device and provide equal ease of use across all platforms for patients.</p>\r\n<p>No one likes visiting a website on a smartphone or tablet, only to have the website cut off pages or become difficult to find the navigation bar. At Doctor Genius, we create mobile-first websites that will render properly on any device. This way, when a patient uses your website, they will be able to easily view and navigate your services no matter the device.</p>\r\n<p>Another benefit of working with Doctor Genius is that we have an in-house support team available every day to help answer any questions, fix any issues and address any concerns you may have.

With that in mind, we are hosting a webinar on the newest RankBrain update that can affect your practice website and the number of people who see your website in Google search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is RankBrain?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first question probably running through your mind is “What is RankBrain?” Google has created a machine-learning artificial intelligence system that helps Google process its search results, known as RankBrain. While this may not seem like something that could heavily impact your website, there are three main ranking factors that Google relies on, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Links</li>\r\n \t<li>Content</li>\r\n \t<li>RankBrain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>RankBrain is a machine-learning AI, which means that it can acquire knowledge by building on what it already knows and from what one teaches to it. In other words, RankBrain will ignore websites with low-quality content in search results. This will only make it more difficult for people to find your website in search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>It is crucial to have a team who understand how this update works and how to implement quality content that helps potential patients find your website and remain on the website pages longer than other websites. The bounce rate is the rate at which people view a webpage and leave it, “bounce,” for another page. In fact, lower bounce rate as a byproduct of high-quality content.

People may<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/home-part-iv-effective-calls-action/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>An effective call-to-action can be the final push that a potential patient needs to seek a specific service. People may recall TV commercials from childhood ending with, “Buy now,” or “get one while supplies last.” While these examples can be effective for certain products, medical practices may need a slightly different approach. People will usually spend more time contemplating where to go for any form of medical care than buying a new movie or clothes at a store.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Up front and center</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For a medical practice, the call-to-action is a crucial step that needs to utilize both specific text and a button/window to capture the attention of a potential patient. For instance, if there is an option to “Schedule an appointment today,” then there needs to be a button or window that the individual can interact with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interaction is key since it promotes direct contact with the practice through the online portal or by calling the practice over the phone. The call-to-action can also help users navigate to other pages on the website from the home page. For instance, having the call-to-action button, “Click Here to Read More” can increase the chance of the individual navigating from the home page to that page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calls-to-action help create a home page that entices users to seek the practice’s professional service. It is important to have a clear call-to-action on the website home page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Be clear and concise</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov14-blog-img-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Curatti.com states that 70 percent of small business websites do not have clear calls-to-action on their homepage.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The call-to-action on a home page needs to be clear in order to improve conversion rate. The conversion rate for a website is the rate of website users who become patients. In order to increase the conversion rate, it is important to have a clear call-to-action that highlights the specific type of care at the practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presenting the call-to-action in the first person to address the user will also help. Another step in creating an effective call-to-action is to include easy-to-access contact information. By structuring a home page to display the call-to-action in an easy-to-read place, the user will be more likely to interact with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we can customize the home page to not only highlight specific services but also present calls to action in such a way that the patient will be more likely to interact with the website. While it is not difficult to write out the phrase “Call Now” and place it on a button, we know the proper way to create and place the call-to-action.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
