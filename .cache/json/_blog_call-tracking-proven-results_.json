In order for a client to order the product, contact customer service, inter-office communication, schedule an appointment, you need a phone number. For a professional medical practice, having a call tracking number helps with much more than just scheduling appointments. People are more likely to click call a tracking number online than email the professional.\r\n\r\n<h3>More than just a means of tracking the number of calls</h3>\r\n\r\nIn a 2014 study by Google, the results show that 78 percent of consumers think the local address in an ad is important and 77 percent think displaying a phone number is important. Possible patients want to feel they are contacting a service that will not cheat them out of quality. If patients find it difficult to contact a practice, then they will be more inclined to seek services elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe can help professionals utilize what are known as “trust signals” such as a phone number, address, online reviews and more to help show patients that the practice is real and trustworthy. However, a medical professional may not enjoy the idea of having his or her personal phone as a main point of contact for patients. A call tracking number will be available for future patients and will help to track calls.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p>In the same Google study, 70 percent of participants prefer a call button on a website when using their smartphone.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nIt is important to listen to what consumers enjoy or find easiest to use in communication. Patients may seek a different practice than their current one if it is too difficult to contact. At Doctor Genius, we can help utilize call tracking and determine the most effective means of communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22b-The-Study-Call-Tracking.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-599\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22b-The-Study-Call-Tracking.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22b-The-Study-Call-Tracking-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Using call tracking to help you</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we use call tracking to:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Track the number of calls a patient is getting</li>\r\n \t<li>Help the professional differentiate between old and new clients before picking up the phone</li>\r\n \t<li>Create effective tools such as a calling button on the website for easy-smartphone use access</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe understand how to utilize computer, tablet and smartphone platforms to provide the proper view of a client’s website.

While anyone can make a post or write a blog, the correct quality content will make all the difference. In order to help a professional practice receive an increase of views on a website, the patient needs to have easy-to-access content on the site and ensure that it is the right information people need to find.\r\n\r\nIn a 2015 study, Google finds that 65 percent of smartphone users search for the relevant information, no matter who is providing the information. With at-home products allowing people to utilize voice search instead of typing searches online, patients will use certain keywords or terms that may limit search results.\r\n\r\nWith so many alternative methods for seeking a medical practice and a constantly changing digital market, medical professionals need to know how to navigate the digital market.  Medical professionals have the skills and knowledge to treat patients for a variety of conditions, but may not have the knowledge on how to present and market that skill.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Doctor Genius knows how to present and organize content in an effective manner for better results.\r\n\r\n<h3>Presenting material effectively</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-618\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june27-blog-img-2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> The 2017 State of Inbound report finds that the top challenge for 63 percent of marketers is generating traffic and leads.</p></div>\r\n\r\nA website with too much information will make it difficult for people to navigate a medical professional’s website.
