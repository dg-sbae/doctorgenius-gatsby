With its widespread nature, governments and organizations<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/managing-loans-amid-coronavirus/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The World Health Organization announced Wednesday that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814474930/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says\" target=\"_blank\">coronavirus (COVID-19) is officially a pandemic</a>. With its widespread nature, governments and organizations are implementing protective measures. Many are restricting their travel, working from home, and avoiding large groups of people. These things, and other factors, are presenting businesses with a variety of challenges.</p>\r\n<p>One question many business owners are asking themselves is, “How will I be able to manage my business’s finances during this time?” Managing loans or just keeping a business afloat during a lull or shutdown period brought on by COVID-19 can be challenging and confusing. Fortunately, there are some ways businesses can plan and navigate this turbulent environment.</p>\r\n<h2>Common Issues Businesses May Encounter</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has unfortunately presented businesses with a list of potential problems. While it is important not to panic, it is just as important to be aware of some of the possible factors. Access to capital may be the biggest concern for businesses. Things like payroll and inventory are affected by market fluctuations, so businesses should prepare by assessing their access options as soon as possible so that they can adjust accordingly. Fortunately, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has rolled out an assistance plan for small businesses affected by COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>There are additional factors to consider. These include workforce capacity, employee wellbeing, inventory, supply chain, insurance coverage issues, changing market demand, marketing, and cleanup. It is critical to contact insurance providers and suppliers to get a read on the situation. Additionally, business owners and managers should be <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html\" target=\"_blank\">developing contingency plans</a> for the factors above, whether the overall situation becomes worse, stays the same, or starts to improve. Doing so will mitigate the collateral damage leveed on your business by the virus.</p>\r\n<h2>Decreasing Revenue With Oncoming Loan Payments and Other Expenses</h2>\r\n<p>A significant potential challenge for companies is losing business while still having to make payments on loans, rent, and other expenses. While this may seem like an insurmountable situation at first, there are steps people can take to mitigate some of the damage to their business.</p>\r\n<h3>FDIC and Banks</h3>\r\n<p>On March 9, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) released <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/coronavirus/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">a statement</a> that they are working with federal and state banking agencies to help customers who are affected by COVID-19. Additionally, the FDIC stated that regulatory agencies are encouraging financial institutions to work with customers. This is potentially good news for those businesses facing less revenue and mounting payments.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, companies can reach out to their issuers, and inquire if they may be willing to adjust their existing payment plan. Also, if a business has an emergency savings fund, it may need to start dipping into it until it resolves payment issues.</p>\r\n<h3>The White House and SBA Assistance</h3>\r\n<p>President Trump has signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-taken-unprecedented-steps-respond-coronavirus-protect-health-safety-americans/\" target=\"_blank\">economic assistance package</a> into effect to help assist both businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. This comes as one of the numerous steps the federal government has recently taken to deal with the mounting situation in America.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the federal government has instructed the SBA to supply affordable loans that will assist businesses and workers affected by the outbreak. Congress is in talks to fund the program with an additional $50 billion. The SBA has also provided <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/page/guidance-businesses-employers-plan-respond-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19#section-header-4\" target=\"_blank\">resources and guidance for businesses</a> on their website.</p>\r\n<p>As the situation develops, so too may the potential challenges for businesses. Owners and workers can better navigate these hurdles by adopting a proactive approach, by utilizing government assistance, and by continually staying informed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have provided href=&#8221;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html&#8221;_blank&#8221;>interim guidance for businesses and workers during the COVID-19 outbreak</a> on their website.</p>\r\n\r\n<b><p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Not only have traders seen the effects of the virus, but<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-covid-19-may-affect-the-healthcare-industry/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to greatly impact the global economy. Not only have traders seen the effects of the virus, but now the overall U.S. economy is seeing them too. On Monday, all three major stock indexes fell at least 12%, and The Federal Reserve cut interest rates. As cases rise, more businesses are shutting their doors to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>The healthcare industry is one of the economic sectors affected by the outbreak. This pandemic may put considerable stress on hospitals, medical practices, and health care workers. It is difficult to accurately predict how the system will hold up under the potential influx of patients. Things like revenue, supplies, staffing, billing, and resources will likely be affected. How it reacts will likely impact future changes to the U.S. healthcare system.</p>\r\n<h2>Changes and Risks For Healthcare Workers</h2>\r\n<p>Given that they care for infected individuals, medical workers are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 than those in other fields. As hospital and doctor visits for the virus rise, it could pose a greater risk for healthcare workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends following their own <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/steps-to-prepare.html\" target=\"_blank\">procedure and guidelines</a> to help prevent those in the healthcare industry and their patients from getting sick. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has also published a detailed article about <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html\" target=\"_blank\">working during the outbreak of this virus</a>.</p>   \r\n<p>One subset of the medical sector that is benefiting from COVID-19 is telehealth. Telehealth is a category of healthcare services that provides doctor visits remotely. In recent weeks, telehealth companies and their affiliated medical practices have experienced an increase in business and attention. In anticipation of this, Congress passed a bill which <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/telehealth-benefits-medicare-are-lifeline-patients-during-coronavirus-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">waived telehealth service restrictions to seniors on Medicare.</a> This could be an effective way to limit exposure and mitigate the spread of the virus while still receiving medical care.</p>  \r\n<h2>Impact On Dental Practices</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 outbreak also affects dentists and their staff. On Monday, the American Dental Association (ADA) <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2020-archive/march/ada-recommending-dentists-postpone-elective-procedures\" target=\"_blank\">recommended that dentists postpone elective procedures</a> for at least three weeks. This was outlined in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. The ADA specified that dental offices should focus on treating patients with urgent and emergency cases so that those with these levels of dental issues will not be placing additional stress on already overworked hospitals. Additionally, the CDC has issued <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/summary-infection-prevention-practices/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a> to dental offices for preventing the spread of the virus.</p>\r\n<h2>COVID-19 Funding Bill</h2>\r\n<p>The President signed an $8.3 billion <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6074/text\" target=\"_blank\">emergency spending bill</a> on Friday aimed at treating and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Over $3 billion of the bill fund went to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use flexibly. $950 million went to fund state and local health sectors for things like staffing and other critical needs. Additionally, $300 million went toward vaccine and treatment research, development, and production. Lastly, $1.25 billion went to international activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dental practices, medical practices, and businesses will likely see several changes during the COVID-19 outbreak. While these changes may present new challenges, companies can implement changes of their own to help navigate the changing landscape. It is vital to remain informed and utilize resources provided by the government and other organizations so that businesses can better adapt to the COVID-19 environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Many Americans are unsure how coronavirus&#8217; new designation as a pandemic will affect the way they conduct business. It is important to know what to expect and have a plan in place in case you are placed on lockdown. You should also know what to do if you need to work from home.</p>\r\n<h3>Understanding Lockdowns</h3>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/global/emergency-lockdown\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</a> (NIH), lockdown procedures are necessary when an immediate threat presents itself to building occupants. During these instances, it becomes more dangerous for occupants to leave the building than it is for them to stay in secured areas. With the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens may be placed under lockdown if disease-causing contaminants have been released into the environment.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21172390/italy-lockdown-coronavirus-expansion-lombardy\" target=\"_blank\">entire country of Italy is on lockdown</a> to prevent further spread of coronavirus. Consequently, Italian citizens are not allowed to assemble in public or do anything other than stay at home.</p>\r\n<h3>Lockdown Response Activities</h3>\r\n<p>The number one thing to do during a lockdown is to stay calm, as panicking will only make things worse. If placed under lockdown, individuals should secure themselves at home as soon as possible. They should not leave until directed otherwise by emergency personnel, as doing so will increase the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Follow any directions given by the relevant authorities until and after being given the all-clear.</p>\r\n<h3>Taking Your Practice Remote</h3>\r\n<p>Many business owners may want to take their practice remote in anticipation of a lockdown. Doing so seamlessly involves time and planning. According to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90475330/8-strategies-to-set-up-remote-work-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">a CEO writing for Fast Company</a>, it all &#8220;starts from the top.&#8221; In other words, business owners should lead by example, making themselves present and available on various online tools and channels.</p>\r\n<p>Since there is less non-verbal communication involved in remote work, it is crucial to reinforce the company&#8217;s missions and expectations. At the same time, creating and promoting a digital company culture is critical. To do so, business owners must choose the right tools (such as Slack or Google Hangouts) and keep them in constant use.</p>\r\n<p>Following the example of The United States Office of Personnel Management brought up in an article by The Washington Post, another option is to “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-now-wants-hundreds-of-thousands-of-federal-workers-to-be-ready-to-telework-to-limit-coronavirus-spread/2020/03/10/ea284a12-620b-11ea-b3fc-7841686c5c57_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">issue ­laptops and grant access to computer networks.</a>&#8220;</p>\r\n<h3>Remote Work Strategies for Employees</h3>\r\n<p>Of course, employees should also be aware of the new expectations they will be accountable for while working in a remote work environment. Try to prepare for working from home as soon as possible. This involves taking note of any software, information, bookmarks, phone numbers, and anything else that might be necessary to carry out essential job duties.</p>\r\n<p>Next, set up a designated, separate workspace at home, if possible. Many workers find this helps them strike an appropriate work-life balance. It is crucial to communicate as clearly as possible.</p>\r\n<p>Workers should set up a culture of responsiveness and keep colleagues updated on any deadlines or progress they have made throughout the day. Additionally, those who need to take care of pets or children should be transparent about their schedule.\r\n\r\n<h3>Work Goes On</h3>\r\n<p>With proper planning, you can ensure that your business has a seamless transition into working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can lessen your chances of contracting the coronavirus by taking preventive measures and being prepared for a lockdown. Though feelings of fear and anxiety are natural, it is crucial to stay calm.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
