With that in mind, we are hosting a webinar on the newest RankBrain update that can affect your practice website and the number of people who see your website in Google search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is RankBrain?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first question probably running through your mind is “What is RankBrain?” Google has created a machine-learning artificial intelligence system that helps Google process its search results, known as RankBrain. While this may not seem like something that could heavily impact your website, there are three main ranking factors that Google relies on, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Links</li>\r\n \t<li>Content</li>\r\n \t<li>RankBrain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>RankBrain is a machine-learning AI, which means that it can acquire knowledge by building on what it already knows and from what one teaches to it. In other words, RankBrain will ignore websites with low-quality content in search results. This will only make it more difficult for people to find your website in search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>It is crucial to have a team who understand how this update works and how to implement quality content that helps potential patients find your website and remain on the website pages longer than other websites. The bounce rate is the rate at which people view a webpage and leave it, “bounce,” for another page. In fact, lower bounce rate as a byproduct of high-quality content.

Due to this fact, it is important for medical professionals to build a strong online presence that reaches potential patients. This is where Doctor Genius comes in.</p>\r\n<h3>Connecting patients to doctors</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, our main goal is to help you expand your practice through online marketing. We can help healthcare practitioners expand their patient base, boost brand awareness and help doctors build trustworthy connections with patients that serve as a ladder to sustainable practice growth. To help attract and retain new patients at your practice, we utilize the effectiveness of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Digital media</li>\r\n\t<li>Social marketing</li>\r\n\t<li>Online reviews</li>\r\n\t<li>Quality referrals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can monitor all of this through an online portal that displays the factors of your growth and website activity. Our team has the skills and expertise to utilize these tools and help your practice display in Google searches. We understand how to utilize website text and marketing to help your practice be near the top of Google results lists when a patient searches for services within your medical field.</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">To help summarize our services and overall goal, here is a video about Doctor Genius.</blockquote>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cgXsqix8tE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h3>An effective website across multiple devices</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that people use different devices of varying sizes from smart-phone screens to desktop computers. The PEW Research Center finds that as of January 2017, nearly 77 percent of Americans own a smartphone and that around 9 in 10 Americans are regularly online. With this in mind, most people will probably use smartphones, tablets or laptops to conduct any form of web searches. Thus, you need a website that will properly display on any device and provide equal ease of use across all platforms for patients.</p>\r\n<p>No one likes visiting a website on a smartphone or tablet, only to have the website cut off pages or become difficult to find the navigation bar. At Doctor Genius, we create mobile-first websites that will render properly on any device. This way, when a patient uses your website, they will be able to easily view and navigate your services no matter the device.</p>\r\n<p>Another benefit of working with Doctor Genius is that we have an in-house support team available every day to help answer any questions, fix any issues and address any concerns you may have.
