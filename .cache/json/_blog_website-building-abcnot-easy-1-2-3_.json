With multiple options for almost every medical practice in a single city, the competition can get fierce. While patients can utilize free website builders for a quick one-page site, they do not have the skills or internet know-how to continue maintenance on a website.\r\n\r\n<h3>The tools are only as useful as the skills of the holder</h3>\r\n\r\nAs any medical professional will know, having the tools and knowing how to properly use them are two entirely different things. A dentist can have the latest technology, but lack the skills for the proper use. It is the same way with creating an online platform to display one’s practice. At Doctor Genius, our clients are skilled medical professionals who put in the time for the credentials, but do not necessarily have the prowess to keep an effective online presence.\r\n\r\nAn example of a new tool that has pros and cons is the Website Builder available on Google My Business. In an article on searchengineland.com, Senior SEO Manager and Columnist Tony Edward, reviews the new builder. While this builder can help professionals create a one-page website, there are several cons to the process, including only offering a “One-page site, no option to create additional pages,” Edward writes.\r\n\r\nEdward also finds that there is no ability to add custom page titles, no analytics integration and no ability to add call-to-action buttons. With other cons in the article, it is apparent that this new website builder will not benefit anyone searching for a website that can continue to rank, bring in new patients and continue to expand over time. Doctor Genius can offer the website platform while also providing the services to help truly enhance a practice.\r\n\r\n<h3>We can make the process easy</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-630\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-11-img-2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p> While this builder can help professionals create a one-page website, there are several cons to the process, including only offering a “One-page site, no option to create additional pages,” Edward writes.</p></div>\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we have a team of web developers, designers and support technicians on-site to help keep our clients’ websites running smoothly and bringing in new patients.

A professional can have a website of the most eloquent prose or custom-made images from a graphic designer and still not rank very high in search results. The key is learning to understand and speak the languages of Google and the digital market.  Fortunately, Doctor Genius is fluent in several digital languages to help our clients stand out.\r\n\r\n<h3>An active blog says more than 1,000 words</h3>\r\n\r\nWhile clients may want a certain look or feel for a website, the website needs to match up with Google’s requirements in order to rank on search engines. We can ensure that the website is both user-friendly and that it speaks Google’s language. For instance, a website needs active content to even rank in the first place.\r\n\r\nAn active blog is one such way to keep a website active. HubSpot found in 2016 that 1 in 10 blog posts are compounding, which means that organic search can increase their traffic over time. Even old posts can have a positive effect on website traffic as HubSpot found in 2014 that 75 percent of HubSpot’s total blog views and 90 percent of all blog leads come from old blog posts.\r\n\r\nBy posting blogs on a regular basis, even just once a month, medical professionals can bring in more traffic and send a message to Google that they are still active. Google will be more inclined to put an active website with ranking content than a website that does not. Doctor Genius can find the healthy balance to provide clients with a quality user-friendly website that will rank well online.\r\n\r\n<h3>Regular posts bring in more patients</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-18-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-639\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-18-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-18-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/study-july-18-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p>In 2016, HubSpot stated that content consumption for the past two years on Facebook had increased by 57 percent.</p></div>\r\n\r\nAny patient who sees a Facebook page that only posts once every few months will be less-inclined to follow that page. HubSpot found in 2017 that 74 percent of people use Facebook for professional reasons, such as to advertise a practice. Thus, it is important for professional medical practices to keep up regular posts. However, the wrong type of content may not have much of an impact or even have a negative impact.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, with a team of personnel onsite, we post content that will help generate more likes and bring in new followers. By keeping up active Facebook and blog posts, we can help our clients build up a larger patient base and actually retain patients for years to come. We understand how Google ranks web content and will take the necessary steps to enhance our clients’ online presence.

With better thoughts of feeling the sand between one’s toes at the beach, going on vacation, relaxing at home, playing video games and spending time with friends outside of school, children do not even consider the idea of visiting the dentist unless they absolutely have to. However, before school starts up, late summer is the perfect time for parents to bring their child to the dentist. Dentists and other medical professionals need to be ready.\r\n<h3>Catch the wave and bring in more patients</h3>\r\nWith any type of medical practice, summer can easily become the busiest season of the year, especially in the end of July and throughout August, when school is fast approaching. Parents are desperate to get their children in for an appointment before school starts back up and schedules become more complex with a large variety of extracurricular activities.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, finds that students lose more than 51 million hours of school each year to oral diseases and other dental-related illnesses. Dentists have an excellent opportunity to provide the necessary checkup and professional cleaning a child needs to remain healthy.\r\n\r\nBy displaying a professional practice in such a way to showcase how parents can prevent their child from missing school and keep their child healthy, a dental practice will be able to begin bringing in more clients. At Doctor Genius, we can:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Create a call-tracking system to help schedule new patients</li>\r\n \t<li>Give the client a website that helps the practice stand out in the digital market</li>\r\n \t<li>Help the client showcase the best qualities of their practice to potential patients</li>\r\n \t<li>Help clients maintain a constant flow of patients throughout the year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEven if the practice presents the benefits of summer appointments on a website, it is in the style and details of the presentation that will truly help a practice stand out.\r\n<h3>Don’t miss out on this opportunity</h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-619\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/study-june-29-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<div style=\"width: 300px; border-left: 3px solid #666666; margin-center: 1px; padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n\r\nIn fact, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, finds that students lose more than 51 million hours of school each year to oral diseases and other dental-related illnesses.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we have the tools and technology to help you showcase your practice and build a strong digital presence online.
