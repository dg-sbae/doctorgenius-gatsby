For many parents who now have to work remotely, they may face additional challenges concentrating on work, and dealing with their kids as coronavirus disease continues to be a problem. Parents need to implement a setup that allows them to work undisturbed and keep everyone happy.</p>\r\n<h2>Maintaining a safe and happy WFH space</h2>\r\n<p>Here are five creative ways to work productively at home by keeping the Work-From-Home, WFH, space safe and happy:</p>\r\n<h3>Develop a schedule</h3>\r\n<p>Creating a strict schedule that is identical to a normal school day can be helpful. The kids will continue to wake up, eat, and get dressed as usual. Then they can stay busy with assignments. When they are engaged, parents can focus on getting their work done. During productive hours, the kids should be distracted with playtime.</p>\r\n<h3>Use technology</h3>\r\n<p>Provide toys for the kids to play with and set time for them to use technology, away from the work area. Kids love movies or computer time, so maximize that. Educational websites are available to improve a child&#8217;s creativity. When on a strict deadline, a new movie could work like a charm.</p>\r\n<h3>Use door signs</h3>\r\n<p>There should always be a private space, though; it could be the bedroom, closet, basement, guest room, or an area where one can have undisturbed quiet space. Separating the space makes drawing the line much easier. In the WFH space, there can be a sign on the door, so when they see the &#8220;stop&#8221; sign, they know not to come in unless there is something important going on. If the sign shows &#8220;enter,&#8221; then they can come in.</p>\r\n<h3>Set boundaries for the children</h3>\r\n<p>It is necessary to set boundaries for kids when working from home, especially if they are of school age. Parents can allow their kids to watch more TV and play games than usual to stay occupied. The kids need to understand that it is temporary, however. While they are at it, parents can tell them when they do not want to be disturbed. Even if there is no designated office space in the house, establishing clear boundaries with the kids can help.</p>\r\n<h3>Old-school activities</h3>\r\n<p>Before gadgets came around, puzzles and scrapbooking were the cool stuff. They can still work to keep children busy and keep the WFH space safe and happy while the COVID-19 lockdown lasts. These activities can be interesting, and more importantly, they tend to be time-consuming. So, encourage the kids to channel their inner craftmanship during workhours.</p>\r\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\r\n<p>It is normal for children to desire attention. If both parents are working from home, creating shifts can make remote work much easier. If a parent works early in the morning, their partner can wake up the kids and handle tasks around the house. Switching shifts will allow parents to work uninterruptedly throughout the day. If switching shifts between partners are not feasible, especially for those whose partners cannot work remotely during the COVID-19 crisis, creating a strict schedule and planning could help optimize the day.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Fortunately, there is still hope for businesses and private practices. At Doctor Genius, we can help dentists, and other practices maximize their online presence and reach in the digital market. These steps, when done correctly, can help you chart your way toward building a strong, healthy, and resilient practice following the quarantine.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a resilient business after a pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies are creating contingency plans as precautions against COVID-19. Some are implementing or adapting existing plans, while others have to develop new plans. The following are measures that companies can take to build a stronger and healthier business.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider the effect of coronavirus on customers</h3>\r\n<p>Depending on the industry, customers might be experiencing certain difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Business owners need to think strategically about the challenges that customers are facing and what can be done to help them. Using those facts, they can create a new sales pitch and structure their marketing plans to meet those challenges and needs.</p>\r\n<p>Regular business challenges typically worsen during a crisis. Business owners have the role of restructuring their product offerings to address the specific struggles faced by their customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Adopt new sales mediums</h3>\r\n<p>Despite the total lockdown, people will need to make purchases, providing opportunities to offer your products or services through alternative sales channels. For instance, if COVID-19 is halting customer visits to the company’s store, it is time to target and expand eCommerce channels. Business owners need to review their internet marketing efforts and e-commerce sales and see how they provide a boost.</p>\r\n<p>Focus more on conversations on social media and LinkedIn over physical sales meetings. Many B2B companies, especially those who deal with software or digital services and solutions, are already in this realm. The business continues, and more of it might need to go online.</p>\r\n<h3>Focus on long-term investments</h3>\r\n<p>The coronavirus disease situation might be the cue to make long-term investments in the business, especially those in B2B sales. If there is a momentary relapse in sales, then the time is right to reevaluate operations, processes, and existing platforms and get strategic for the long term. If there are major prospects in view, now is the time to dedicate more resources and effort into managing the leads and capitalizing on longer-term opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Monitor the leads, provide reassurances, and let everyone know that there are contingency plans in place and that they can access help when needed. This unparalleled situation is undoubtedly causing many cancellations like concert tickets, airline reservations, and business conferences. Still, high-ticket B2B sales may not suffer as much, unless the crisis continues for longer than anticipated, and companies start to reduce spending and investment.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us to Learn More Today</h2>\r\n<p>Economic recovery might happen earlier than expected. If you fail to position your business strategically, however, you may not be well-placed to build on post-pandemic recovery. Companies can take salient measures now to ensure that they come out of a major crisis like COVID-19 stronger and healthier.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

While working from home has its benefits, especially in terms of productivity, not every business can benefit from this setup. In fact, dentists and medical practices are finding themselves in unique situations.</p>\r\n<p>This is where Doctor Genius can help. Our goal is to help you utilize a practice website and digital platform to maximize your reach online while also helping patients when needed and allowed. For instance, many patients are unsure of what constitutes a dental emergency. Along with that, there are constant developments with teledentistry.</p>\r\n<p>With teledentistry, dentists can provide consultations to patients via video and voice chat, while they remain in their homes. However, it is essential for dentists to establish a work-home-life balance.</p>\r\n<h2>Work-Home-Life Balance</h2>\r\n<p>The key to finding a balance between work and daily routine lies in time management. The following tips help with time management and communication to make the day more productive:</p>\r\n<h3>Plan activities adequately</h3>\r\n<p>Specify the time for work. An alternative might be to stay flexible and divide time between work responsibilities and other tasks. It is advisable to inform colleagues of working hours for better coordination of work hours yet ensure effective collaboration. Identify long and short-term goals and meet set deadlines.</p>\r\n<p>Our team at Doctor Genius can help to outline how dentists can adjust to this new work format, and learn how to balance the new schedules. In some cases, practices may offer emergency or immediate dental services for severe issues.</p>\r\n<h3>Work in a different area from the rest of the home</h3>\r\n<p>Designate an “office space” that is solely dedicated to working. The workspace should be clean and free of clutters to prevent distractions. Everyone in the house should know about this space, so they know not to disturb throughout work hours. If there are kids around, parents can explain to them that sitting on a particular desk on an area means work, and they should only come around for important things. Letting family members understand the need to respect work time and space will allow healthy boundaries, regardless of the size of the workspace.</p>\r\n<h3>Adopt office routines</h3>\r\n<p>Working from home can affect productivity. Therefore, one can stick to the same work structure that exists in the office setting, including meetings with colleagues over video conferencing tools. This encourages a healthy routine to ensure productivity and successful work completion. The communication tools can promote relationships with colleagues, reduce loneliness, and preserve the team spirit. It would help to document work progress and share it with the rest of the team.</p>\r\n<h3>Create time for breaks</h3>\r\n<p>Working from home can make it hard to divide time between personal matters and work. There should be time for breaks to increase productively. Such breaks can be dedicated to favorite tasks such as exercising, cooking, or reading. Planning such activities provides something to anticipate after work. Exercises and mental breaks are important for health and well-being during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn More About Doctor Genius</h2>\r\n<p>The tips above emphasize the importance of maintaining a level of discipline and structure as the day passes. By forming habits that promote effective time management and communication skills, you will be able to create a balance between your work and personal life. These routines might be hard to follow at first, but with persistence, you can make the remote work enjoyable while the COVID-19 pandemic lasts.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
