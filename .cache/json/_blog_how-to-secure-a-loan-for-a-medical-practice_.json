It requires planning and money to build a medical practice from the ground up. Getting the financing to start is a crucial element as, according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/05/10/how-to-set-your-medical-practice-up-for-financial-success/?sh=4cbd0032b1d9\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/05/10/how-to-set-your-medical-practice-up-for-financial-success/?sh=4cbd0032b1d9\">Forbes.com</a>, there are many factors to consider. There are various ways to secure the capital needed for starting a medical practice. At Doctor Genius, we want to see your practice become a reality. Find out the basic ins and outs of a medical practice loan to get things going in the right direction.</p>\r\n<h2>The basics of a medical practice loan</h2>\r\n<p>When a provider comes requesting financing, banks want to know about the practice. As a startup, there are no records or statements to supply. Thus, when seeking a loan, you must provide copies of your business plan, financial projections, and insight into how well similar practices perform in the area. Depending on your age and the state of your personal accounts, you may need a co-signer or someone with solid finances to back a traditional loan application.</p>\r\n<h2>Types of loans for medical practices</h2>\r\n<p>As a medical practitioner, you may find there are more types of loans available for you than the lending options for traditional businesses.</p>\r\n<h3>Equipment leasing</h3>\r\n<p>Opening a medical practice often requires expensive and advanced equipment. Purchasing these items outright may not make much sense because the technology is always evolving and <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/understanding-medical-product-lifecycle/\">newer models are introduced frequently</a>. You may want to instead take a look at leasing the equipment you need. Finance companies and equipment retailers may have contracts that allow medical practices to rent any piece of equipment needed. At the end of the lease term, you may choose to purchase the items or lease new models.</p>\r\n<h3>Line of credit</h3>\r\n<p>There are times when the practice may need access to cash quickly. A business line of credit may prove the best option. This financing option allows you open access to a set amount of funds. You use what you need when you need it. Otherwise, the available balance remains accessible only when it is needed. This type of loan can provide peace of mind for emergency situations.</p>\r\n<h3>Short-term business loan</h3>\r\n<p>A short-term business loan is one of the easiest ways you can get cash for your practice. Many lenders have online portals and can provide approval in a short time. These loans are typically best for situational purchases. The information required to get this type of loan is minimal and the money usually is provided quickly. The repayment terms can range from three months to three years, with payments typically auto-debited from your business account.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help calculate costs</h2>\r\n<p>Do not let the worry about securing a medical practice loan overcome the prospect of starting your own business. With so many financing options available, you can surely find something that fits your needs. Keep in mind that there are other requirements for creating a successful business and financial forecast.

The amount of trust patients have in your practice, as well as what your practice is worth financially, can have a large impact on its health and growth. Taking a closer look at these can improve both your practice and the experience of your patients. </p>\r\n<h2>Different aspects of brand value</h2>\r\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/stories/innovation/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-2020/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/stories/innovation/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-2020/\">Forbes</a> defines brand value by how much the brand would be worth if it was sold, there is much more that goes into determining that number than just inventory on hand or what is in the bank account. Revenue can sharply increase or decrease based on aspects such as brand authority and brand equity.</p>\r\n<h3>Brand authority</h3>\r\n<p>The level of trust patients have in your practice, as well as the degree to which patients view your practice as providing expert care in your specific field, determines its brand authority. Because this can be very subjective, brand authority can fluctuate quickly. Cure a high-profile patient or master a difficult medical procedure, and your practice will typically earn more brand authority. Cause complications for a well-known patient or get involved in a medical malpractice case and your brand authority will generally plummet. </p>\r\n<h3>Brand equity</h3>\r\n<p>The loyalty of your patients, who your practice is associated with, and how visible your practice is combine to form brand equity. Like brand authority, brand equity can shift quickly because it is subjective. Become associated with a popular medial foundation or heal the mayor, and your practice is likely to get more visibility, thus increasing patient loyalty and, subsequently, brand equity. </p>\r\n<h2>The importance of brand value for patients </h2>\r\n<p>A higher brand value can not only help increase the profitability of your practice, but also assist with improving patient relations. </p>\r\n<h3>Increased patient loyalty</h3>\r\n<p>If the brand authority or brand value of your practice is low, patients tend to be warier about scheduling a procedure and can have negative expectations about their experience. In this case, it is easy for those expectations to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, even if nothing major goes wrong. When brand authority is high, patients are more likely to expect a positive experience at your practice. As long as these expectations are met, you have most likely created a patient for life.</p>\r\n<h3>Faster work in progress times</h3>\r\n<p>Have you ever looked at a stack of unpaid patient statements and wondered what you could do to encourage a faster work in progress time? Building brand authority and value can be part of the solution. Not many patients are rushing to pay the bill from a small, seemingly insignificant practice no one is talking about. However, patients can be more likely to submit payment more quickly for a well-respected practice that is popular in the community. </p>\r\n<h2>Build your brand and your practice</h2>\r\n<p>Building your practice starts with patient acquisition, which our team at Doctor Genius knows all about. Our experience can help you understand and market your brand so that you can increase both brand awareness and your patient roster.

If you are looking to increase your practice&#8217;s online reviews to appeal to more patients, it is better to focus on Google reviews over Yelp reviews. Here are some reasons to concentrate your efforts on Google reviews.</p>\r\n<h2>A Better Way To Promote a Practice</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-growth-in-online-local-reviews-continues-to-dominate-but-292571\">BrightLocal</a>, Google reviews can be the way to go when looking to improve SEO ranking. Using the right review platform can make marketing efforts as productive as possible. Reports from <a href=\"https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/\">ReviewTrackers</a> show 63.6% of people check Google reviews before choosing a business to visit. Putting more time into increasing reviews on other platforms may not receive a favorable investment return. As the average star rating on Google is notably higher than on Yelp, a business is more likely to benefit from a higher rating on Google than Yelp. </p>\r\n<h3>Avoid the Negative Impact of Yelp</h3>\r\n<p>The ReviewTrackers report also notes that most people use filters when searching to eliminate any business with less than a four-star rating. Yelp may exclude one&#8217;s practice from search results before even being viewed since it has a lower average rating. In this case, the practice will be affected by a lack of visibility.</p>\r\n<h3>Encourage Patients To Leave Google Reviews</h3>\r\n<p>While not all reviewers will use Google, it can be beneficial to encourage patients to review one&#8217;s practice on the desired platform. Rather than use vague language when asking for a review, mention Google specifically. Most people tend to follow directions, and because Google is a widely popular platform as well as user-friendly, it should be simple for patients to leave a review on Google.</p>\r\n<h3>Add a Direct Link</h3>\r\n<p>Another tip is to add a website link that leads directly to the Google review form. This addition will make it easier for patients to leave reviews on that site instead of having to pull one up by themselves. Many practices send patients an email after treatment or procedures to ensure they are recovering well and are not experiencing any unexpected side effects. Asking specifically for a Google review and adding a direct link in this type of email can remind patients who may have forgotten to leave a Google review.</p>\r\n<h2>Draw Patients in With Positive Reviews</h2>\r\n<p>Our team at Doctor Genius knows how important it is to get good online reviews.
