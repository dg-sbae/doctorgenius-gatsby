Until recently, many thought the on-demand economy would be a passing trend, directed toward the young and wealthy. However, recent data shows that is far from the case, with <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy\">30% of on-demand consumers</a> being between the ages of 35 and 54, and another 22% age 55 and older.</p>\r\n<p>As to be expected, the largest sector of the on-demand economy is online marketplaces. This is followed by transportation, with food and grocery coming in third. As a health care practitioner, you may assume you are not a part of this, but you would be wrong. On-demand health and beauty services account for $8.1 billion in consumer spending each year, and analysts anticipate spending will only grow with time. It is important that you adapt your content marketing strategy to accommodate this change and appeal to the on-demand market.</p>\r\n<h2>The power of listicles</h2>\r\n<p>While a strong content marketing strategy utilizes a variety of content types, consumers respond particularly well to lists and bullet points. The most popular women’s magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and Good Housekeeping have included listicles for decades.</p>\r\n<p>Listicles appeal to consumers’ need to lump things into round-numbered groups, a tendency that marketing scholars Robert M. Schindler and Mathew S. Isaac refer to as the “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1\">top 10 effect</a>.” According to the scholars, by lumping items into rounded numbered groups, such as “Top 10,” or “20 Best,” it becomes easier for consumers to process mass amounts of information quickly. Not only that, but it also helps them to make what they deem “more informed decisions” quickly.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, when a list details the “Top 10 On-Demand Health Care Services,” the 10 items within the list get particular notice. Consumers tend to consider other services that do not make the cut as “inferior.” This is true even of services that come in at number 11, even if the cause of that ranking is minimal or unknown. The impression most people get when viewing such a list is that if an item does not rank in the top 10, it is a level down.</p>\r\n<h2>What this means for your practice</h2>\r\n<p>According to Digital Journal, 30% of blog posts are lists, suggesting that you cannot go wrong with this format. In addition to aspiring to be a part of a Top 10 list by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">leveraging technology</a>, you should create lists of your own. At Doctor Genius, listicles are one of our go-to content formats for driving engagement and guiding readers through the sales cycle. On behalf of our clients, we create lists on everything from the top dental restoration procedures to ways patients can improve heart health to the benefits of clear braces.</p>\r\n<h2>Leverage listicles to boost your rankings</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we are familiar with the most effective strategies for marketing health care and dental practices online.

While we at Doctor Genius like to think of ourselves as a team of forward-thinking individuals, we tend to agree. It is true that negative word-of-mouth marketing can have a damaging effect on customers’ perceptions of a brand and, therefore, the brand’s profits, but the truth is that <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/\">negative W-O-M is what you make of it</a>. If you do nothing about poor reviews or worse, try to hide from them, they will continue to haunt you. However, if you address them head-on and use them as learning mistakes, you can not only recover but can become better than you were before.</p>\r\n<h2>Negative W-O-M indicates loyalty</h2>\r\n<p>Back in 2011, LoyaltyOne, a Cincinnati-based company that provides loyalty marketing services to enterprises, announced a few <a href=\"https://customerthink.com/turning_a_frown_upside_down_how_negative_wom_can_help_your_brand/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://customerthink.com/turning_a_frown_upside_down_how_negative_wom_can_help_your_brand/\">changes to its AIRMILES Reward Program</a>. Among the changes was one that affected redemption requirements, which outraged many customers. While the brand fully expected some pushback, it was surprised by who was doing the pushback and why.</p>\r\n<p>According to the company’s reports, the most verbal (read: outraged) customers were those who the brand perceived to be their most valuable. These individuals were, on average, 70% more engaged with the rewards program than those who remained silent. The company realized that the negative comments stemmed from customers’ emotional connection to the brand that, prior to the program changes, was a positive one.</p>\r\n<h2>How to use negative W-O-M to your advantage</h2>\r\n<p>Regardless of who is posting negative comments about your practice, you can learn from LoyaltyOne’s response to the 2011 situation. In addition to monitoring customers’ responses throughout the entire commentary period, the brand also publicly clarified any inaccuracies and responded to specific questions. Its participation in the conversation offset the bad experience with a new, positive one. It also reinforced the brand’s core values that attracted the most engaged members in the first place. The overall result was that approximately one-third of outraged commenters ended up redeeming their points afterward.</p>\r\n<p>#1800Flowers is another major company from which you can learn, but unlike with LoyaltyOne, its experience teaches you what not to do. On February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2015, many 1-800-Flowers customers received wilted flower arrangements and half-crushed chocolates. Though the company has a long-standing reputation for delivering outstanding products, this single bad experience stuck with customers for months. Though it did issue a public statement apologizing for the incident, Spiegel Research Center suggests <a href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/news/1800flowersfail---negative-word-of-mouth-matters.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/news/1800flowersfail---negative-word-of-mouth-matters.html\">three other steps</a> it should have taken — and that you should consider if you fall victim to negative online marketing:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Create an opportunity for NWOM posters to re-experience your brand. </strong>Do not just issue a refund or apology. Provide the product or service again, but for free.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reach out to NWOM posters individually.</strong> So that those directly affected by your actions know that your apology is sincere and that you genuinely care about their opinions, reach out to them individually. Show that you are willing to listen, learn, and change.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Use negative W-O-M</strong> as an opportunity to participate in customer discussions and show followers that you take any complaints about your brand seriously.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Take control of your online reputation</h2>\r\n<p>As a leader in the online marketing space, Doctor Genius has the experience and know-how to help you overcome negative word-of-mouth through reputation management and a robust content strategy.

Among those challenges is your ability to incite trust in prospective patients, demonstrate competency of care, and encourage prospects to choose you over your competitors — all before they ever set foot in your office. While an up-to-date website, strong content, and patient reviews can go a long way toward helping you overcome several marketing challenges, original photos and detailed imagery may be just what you need to overcome the unique three.</p>\r\n<h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>\r\n<p>You can invest all your resources into beautiful web design, informative content, and strategic SEO, but without supplementing your efforts with high-quality imagery, your efforts may be for naught. According to Solve, websites that feature “good images” receive <a href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\">94% more views</a> than those without photos or with low-quality images. Moreover, substandard photos may hurt your practice more than a lack of photos, as low-grade pictures send the impression that your brand is cheap, impersonal, and untrustworthy. The right photos, however, can do the opposite and help your practice overcome challenges one, two, and three.</p>\r\n<h3>Build trust</h3>\r\n<p>Original photography is one of the best ways to build trust in prospective patients. Real images give prospects a glimpse of who you are as a provider and what type of community you have created in-office. Genuine smiles on the faces of real patients and team members help prospects feel reassured that you operate a warm, welcome, and caring environment and that people are happy to be in your care.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, before and after photos of real patients let you live up to the adage of “show, don’t tell.” It is easy enough to state on your website that you specialize in full-mouth restorations, but convincing patients that this is true requires proof. An image gallery with clearly labeled before and after photos can serve as all the evidence you need, though it cannot hurt to accompany images with patient testimonials as well.</p>\r\n<h3>Demonstrate competency of care</h3>\r\n<p>Trust and competency go hand in hand. If a prospect does not trust that you can competently manage his or her care, he or she will not choose you despite your other redeeming qualities. Use imagery to provide a comprehensive and visual overview of your services, procedures, and outcomes, such as what we did with our <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\">new Doctor Genius video</a>. If you use high-tech equipment in your practice, go beyond original photos and use videos to demonstrate how it works. Do not be afraid to play with photos and video to guide prospects through the patient journey so they know what to expect. Finally, use imagery to educate patients on your services, address common health issues, and provide tips for how patients can protect their health.</p>\r\n<h3>Differentiate your brand</h3>\r\n<p>Last but not least, original photos are an effective way to set yourself apart from the competition. Whereas many brands still rely on stock imagery, whether because of time, cost, or unawareness, you can set your brand apart by offering a wholly transparent and honest look at your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Attract more patients with tailored solutions</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we focus solely on developing comprehensive digital marketing solutions for health care professionals.
