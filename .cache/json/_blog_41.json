This will grow your practice and gain patient referrals. If you don’t have a lot of time on your hands, don’t worry – most dentists don’t. Fortunately, these social media tips are so easy that you or your office manager can implement them in between patients. As a result, your organic marketing results will improve.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Write a value proposition.</strong> Update your cover image to include your value proposition so that users immediately know what you are about and how you can help them. For example, “healthy smiles for the entire family”. This will increase the likelihood of someone liking or following your Facebook page when they come across it.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Create a call-to-action.</strong> Content marketing is just as important in social media as it is for your website. Write content that inspires people to act, for example, “click here to read more”. While simple, this tip will increase how many clicks you get.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Build fans organically.</strong> It is okay if your Facebook fan page grows steadily over time. This is far better than purchasing a block of fake fans that don’t live near you and could never use your dental services. The power of organic marketing and social media is the ability to expose your practice to those that live within your local area. Focus on the objective, even if it is one fan at a time.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Create awesome blog posts.</strong> You should include blog writing in your content marketing strategy since it gives you the opportunity to share your knowledge, answer questions and provide information for prospective patients. The more often you blog, the higher your chances are for being viewed as a knowledge leader in the community. Through social media, you can posts your blogs and encourage users to read and comment. You can further tie it into your social media by telling people to ask any questions they have that weren’t answered by the blog post. This can increase your user engagement.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Keep it interesting.</strong> Use a variety of post types in order to keep it interesting for your followers. For example, post a video then a picture and a text post. You should also vary the type of content while always staying relevant to your business or community. As an added benefit, you can review your social media analytics to see what type of posts gets the best reaction from users. This will help you to cultivate a more effective organic marketing strategy.\r\n\r\n<strong>• Use interesting images.</strong> There are a variety of free apps that you can download to edit images. If you want to impose a text onto a photo and aren’t sure how, pull out your smartphone. Most of these will let you take a picture, impose text and post directly to Facebook. PicCollage is an easy one to use and completely free.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to improve your content marketing or social media, call and speak with a Dental SEO Sites representative.","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Practice Management"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/recentpost-02-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/9dc27/recentpost-02-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/4fe8c/recentpost-02-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"a3feb621-2bd4-526a-8aa2-73f3bf8a1cff"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null}},{"node":{"title":"Local Searches Are on the Rise","slug":"local-searches-are-on-the-rise-2","excerpt":"Google has reported that mobile searches containing the phrases “near me” or “nearby” have doubled over the past twelve months.<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/local-searches-are-on-the-rise-2/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Google has reported that mobile searches containing the phrases “near me” or “nearby” have doubled over the past twelve months. This represents a significant increase in the number of people conducting a local search, determined to connect with a business close by. This can benefit your dental practice by connecting you with a prospective patient that is in immediate need of your services.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Nearby Business Listings product</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>To capitalize on this growing trend, Google is offering a new advertising product. The Nearby Business Listings product replaces some of the typical ad copy with features that consumers use on a regular basis. Features like click-to-call and click-for-directions appear in the ad so that when someone is conducting a local search, they can find a nearby business and immediately connect with them. If the search is a mobile search, the convenience of immediately navigating to the business cannot be overstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a dentist, you should also consider how you can use this knowledge in your current marketing plans. As a company that specializes in optimizing for local search, we recommend that you check all of your online business listings to ensure that your information is accurate. Your name, address, phone number, and hours of operation need to be included with your business listings to ensure that someone can find you in a local search. Additionally, you should optimize your website for mobile users. We recommend building a responsive design website that adjusts based on the type of device that is being used to view it. This will allow your site to have built-in features like click-to-call or click-for-directions. Given how many people conduct a mobile search for a local dentist, this is an easy way to ensure that they call you instead of a dentist down the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneously, your website needs to be optimized for local search. When creating your SEO strategy, it is important to include your location in multiple places on your site. Think of the phrase that people will use when searching for a dental office in your area (or better yet – have us pull the analytics for you). For example, if you are in Orange County, California, do people search for an “OC dentist”, “Orange County dentist”, etc.? The terms and phrases that they would use should be incorporated into the content on your website, giving your site the opportunity to show up when someone does a local search for a “dentist nearby”. After all, the search engines know where you are located based on the information that you give them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can audit your website to ensure that it is mobile friendly and that you are optimized to show up in a local search. This way you can benefit from the increase in mobile searches for a dentist “near me”.</p>","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Digital Marketing"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/trend-04-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/a7715/trend-04-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/9dc27/trend-04-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/4fe8c/trend-04-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/8c72754883961174eaa3a2cc4b957193/a7715/trend-04-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"10d9bdca-af32-5803-a722-8325e9ef457e"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null}},{"node":{"title":"Use Coupons and Events to Drive Client Conversions","slug":"local-searches-are-on-the-rise","excerpt":"Do you offer coupons and if so, how do they impact your conversions?

This is something that every retailer needs to know and plan for as part of their online marketing. Over the past decade, coupon sites have become more and more popular with affiliates offering a variety of ways to buy something for less money. This can be a good thing when you work with affiliates that have high traffic counts and excellent SEO. After all, the coupons offered on their website can drive more traffic and conversions on yours. The challenge becomes managing the process correctly.\r\n\r\nDo you offer coupons and if so, how do they impact your conversions? This is something that every retailer needs to know and plan for as part of their online marketing. Over the past decade, coupon sites have become more and more popular with affiliates offering a variety of ways to buy something for less money. This can be a good thing when you work with affiliates that have high traffic counts and excellent SEO. After all, the coupons offered on their website can drive more traffic and conversions on yours. The challenge becomes managing the process correctly.\r\n\r\nIn our online marketing plan, be sure to consider how you want to work with your affiliates to ensure that when you do use them to promote coupons, you are not giving up commissions unnecessarily. For example, if someone is in your shopping cart and decides to open a new tab to find a coupon code, the affiliate can track that as a sale using cookies. You will in turn pay a commission, even though the person was on your website first. With that in mind, have your web developer create landing pages and separate URL’s that affiliates can direct traffic to. This will help to keep some of your customers separate. In fact, if you have separate landing pages, you may be able to remove the coupon code section entirely from your main shopping cart. This way the shoppers looking for a discount can come from a coupon site while your regular customers can happily continue paying full price.\r\n\r\nOne way to successfully use coupons is to create promotions on social media. Your Facebook page, for example, is an excellent place to create a graphic with a coupon code or let everyone know that your new inventory is in and the first fifty customers get a discount. With social media, you can drive conversions because these are people that are already familiar with your brand and want to hear from you. People performing a local search are likely to find your website or your social media page, so this is an excellent way to capture business from that traffic as well.\r\n\r\nWe also suggest that you create various events to help drive conversions. This can be used in conjunction with local search by optimizing the content on your website. For example, you could have a trunk sale twice a year and incorporate a breadth of content regarding the issue on your website. That way when users search for one in your local area, your website comes up. Next, promote the trunk sale through social media so that your existing customers can participate. Online promotions and events should be fun and creative so keep that in mind and adjust as needed to drive more conversions.","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Practice Management"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/recentpost-04-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEA//EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABuTRTpBDF/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEhEhMTL/2gAIAQEAAQUC1krLgnjv5tP/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhP/2gAIAQMBAT8BZ0//xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIS/9oACAECAQE/AbQ2/8QAHBAAAgEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEBEhMVGR/9oACAEBAAY/Ar00SjxDMJeH/8QAHBABAAMAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBUZGh/9oACAEBAAE/IXTy3W5dr9Yte8ClcCnuUCDhgjg3sf/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQHN//xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhQf/aAAgBAwEBPxBLwh2qf//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEVH/2gAIAQIBAT8QwNg8b//EAB4QAQEAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQVFhgZHx/9oACAEBAAE/ELNkiuK2Q/co1HqieNdWYwQIzTv7ytnUkVnOaLQgbv5yokbKFV95/9k=","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/a7715/recentpost-04-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/9dc27/recentpost-04-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/4fe8c/recentpost-04-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/5714cf6298e227660af01619cac50889/a7715/recentpost-04-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"3a6b315d-1126-55df-8813-716faeeadd65"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null}},{"node":{"title":"A Blog is the Heartbeat of a Company Website","slug":"a-blog-is-the-heartbeat-of-a-company-website","excerpt":"Even if you don’t know much about blogs, it’s probably obvious to you that they have become more and more<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/a-blog-is-the-heartbeat-of-a-company-website/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"Even if you don’t know much about blogs, it’s probably obvious to you that they have become more and more popular over the years. You’re probably puzzled about why on earth blogs are so popular. Some people might even think that they seem a waste of time, right? Wrong. Blogging has become the trendy, believable way to market your business, and it’s likely this is a trend that is only going to become more influential and have more power than many other forms of advertising.\r\n\r\nThe importance of blogging is hard to understand if you don’t understand the basics of what a blog really is. Let’s look at the world of blogs (a.k.a. the “blogosphere”) in a little more detail.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is a Blog, anyway?</strong>\r\nA blog, which used to be referred to as a web log, is an avenue of sharing with others online. When blogging first started it was basically online journaling. These days, blogging has taken on a whole new meaning. Even though many blogs still exist that are solely the voices of random people, sitting at coffee shops or on their couch, looking for a way to share their innermost voices and opinions about random subjects, there are also an entirely different class of blogs. This other “class” of bloggers is focused on marketing businesses, brands and gaining followers who happily look to them for direction in the online marketplace.\r\n\r\nThink of a blog as a tour guide. Just like we turn to people we trust and respect for advice on what to do in life, a blog can provide a similar comfort level in the online world.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the benefits of Blogging?</strong>\r\nThe main reason for any type of marketing is to grow your business. In your case, not only do you want to gain new patients, you want to make sure that you keep your current ones. So how can a blog help you to accomplish those things?\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Show those search engines who’s boss.</strong> Want to be top-ranking when people Google “local dentists”? Posting to a blog is of utmost importance. Think of your company’s website as a heart and your blog as what keeps it beating. A consistently updated blog with current information (you know, the stuff people actually read) will up your ranking, up your traffic and get you more business.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Prove that you know your stuff.</strong> A blog will help you establish yourself as an authoritative figure that is on top of your specialty. Talk about the trending topics and the latest treatments and procedures and keep people informed. They’ll be more apt to turn to you if they trust you’re education and practices are up to date.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Relate to your patients.</strong> Showing your patients that you’re not just all business all the time will help them to see you as a person and a friend rather than just a service provider. Building relationships is the best form of marketing and blogging will help you to achieve it. Show your personality and the personality of your staff. Write about causes that interest you or hobbies you enjoy. If they see you as just Dr. Jane, you’re kind of boring. If they know you as Dr. Jane who has two Huskies who used to play roller derby and enjoys sailing, you’re much more exciting.\r\n\r\n<strong>Should you BE the Blogger or hire one?\r\n</strong>Now that you get a sense of why having a blog is so critical to marketing your business online, just how you want to accomplish it is up to you. If you don’t have the time or feel unqualified to start and manage your own blog, there are many blogging services out there that are up to the task. Some business owners enjoy writing their own content, while many others find it simpler and more effective to hire an article writer to take care of it for them.\r\n\r\nBeing “social” online needs to involve a mix of informational posts with a good portion of personality. No one wants to be bored out of their mind reading posts after post of your business “mission”! Come on! Would you waste your time reading that stuff? Probably not. To get interest and make people want to read your posts they need to be intriguing. Hiring a writer and someone to manage your blog has great benefit for that reason. They’re purpose is to make sure you have a good online presence and your job remains the same: to run your practice.\r\n\r\n<strong>How to share content across different social profiles</strong>\r\nIn order to get the most out of your blog, it’s important to make sure your posts are SEEN. The best avenue of spreading blog content is to announce it on various social channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn. Keep in mind that images get much more attention than text alone (and might even be “pinned” on Pinterest). Try posting an image with the content attached. Also, make sure that your posts are accompanied by social media “connect” buttons so that readers can quickly and easily share your images and content across their social scene as well.","date":"November 4, 2016","blog_author":"","categories":[{"name":"Genius Lab"}],"author":{"name":"Nick Adams"},"featured_media":{"source_url":"/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/recentpost-02-image.jpg","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/9dc27/recentpost-02-image.jpg 300w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/4fe8c/recentpost-02-image.jpg 600w,\n/static/e416207abadbccf83d258b1179de39b3/a7715/recentpost-02-image.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"id":"a3feb621-2bd4-526a-8aa2-73f3bf8a1cff"},"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc":null}},{"node":{"title":"Learn the Basic Components of SEO","slug":"learn-the-basic-components-of-seo","excerpt":"As experts in local SEO, we are asked a lot of questions by businesses regarding what search engine optimization actually<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/learn-the-basic-components-of-seo/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"As experts in local SEO, we are asked a lot of questions by businesses regarding what search engine optimization actually means and what it involves. For the average business owner, this is an elusive concept that can seem as foreign as a line of code. While most people do not have the time to learn the details of where every link should be placed, it is a good idea for business owners and marketing managers to understand the core concept of SEO, how it works, and why it matters.\r\n\r\n<em>the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.</em>\r\n\r\nThere are three basic components of SEO, and it all starts with keyword research. You need to know what keywords and questions someone would type into a search engine that could lead them to your website. For example, if you are a pediatric dentist someone could type in your name but if they have never heard of you, what other descriptive words would describe your practice? This list should include your location, the age range of patients that you serve, the procedures that you offer, answers to parent questions about oral health, etc. We can help you to come up with a comprehensive list that is based on statistical research.\r\n\r\nNext, you will need on-site optimization. This involves placing keywords throughout your website. They should be included in your on-page content, your titles and meta tags, etc. The overall architecture of your site is also important because it needs to be easy to read and navigate both from a desktop and mobile device. You want to make sure that if someone were to type in a search term, they would arrive at your website and that the content you are providing is what they were expecting to see. Your SEO, website architecture, on-page content and media all need to work together to provide a positive user experience so that your conversions will go up as well.\r\n\r\nLastly, good SEO involves off-site optimization. This is done using avenues like social media. For example, if you send out a Tweet it can include a link back to your website for more information. You can run a contest on Facebook that draws users to your website, etc. Your blog can also be a useful tool for off-site optimization. When done correctly, these three components will work together so that when someone types in a search, your website shows up.\r\n\r\n<strong>Why does SEO matter?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe majority of U.S. adults own a cell phone and use it to search for things on a regular basis. This is in addition to the millions of people that hop on their computer throughout the day. In fact, Google alone has over 1 billion queries daily. Over ninety percent of men and women use a search engine to find information, a business, purchase something, etc. Additionally, eighty percent of people reported searching for something online and then making a purchase from that local business. In other words, search queries lead to more patients and money to your bottom line.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most. Digital marketing can help your practice adapt and grow in the aftermath of COVID-19.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Are Here to Help </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unsure if your dental practice is ready for the digital landscape, we can help.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
