This increases the chances that more people will read your post, which in turn increases the chances of gaining new patients. At Doctor Genius, we can help improve your content management to attract more clients. Along with using the right keywords, it is also important to understand what a salience score refers to.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding salience</h2>\r\n<p>Salience refers to the importance of a language feature within a text. In other words, the language that the writer uses in the web copy helps a search engine understand the true nature of the website. Machine learning technology helps to predict which words or concepts are deemed more important by those reading the text, and writers should strive to incorporate them.</p>\r\n<p>These days, writing content is about more than just getting leads. The content must be helpful and of high quality, which is why <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-speaking-to-a-general-audience/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-speaking-to-a-general-audience/\">tailoring the information</a> is important.  </p>\r\n<h2>How to improve the salience score</h2>\r\n<p>A salience score is what language processors assign to language and words in web copy. The higher the score, the more important it is.</p>\r\n<h3>Use entities in the copy</h3>\r\n<p>To improve the salience score and, ultimately, search ranking, Inc.com talks about how you must <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/david-amerland/a-smart-trick-to-help-your-business-rank-in-google-searches.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.inc.com/david-amerland/a-smart-trick-to-help-your-business-rank-in-google-searches.html\">include entities</a> in one way or another. Doing this causes a search engine, such as Google for example, to calculate the text differently. It may be challenging knowing what words to use, but Google does have an Application Programming Interface that writers can use to see what score the copy would be assigned. Just insert your text into the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\">API demo</a> to see if you should make any changes.</p>\r\n<h3>Position text properly</h3>\r\n<p>Readers tend to place more importance on the beginning of a sentence. To improve your salience score, make sure the topic’s focus is at the start. This may take grammatical tricks to change word order to place emphasis on the topic.</p>\r\n<h3>Increase the number of references to the entity</h3>\r\n<p>You may be able to improve your score if you make more references to the entity. If possible, use different terms that refer to the same recognizable entity. Do this naturally, and skip it if it seems forced, as if you mention the entity too much, it can hurt the score.</p>\r\n<h3>Make the entity the focus in complex sentences</h3>\r\n<p>Search engines like Google are able to perform complex functions that identify linguistic relationships in longer sentences. Language processors can understand the relationships between the subject, object, and verb, and if the entity remains the main focus, the score is higher.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about improving your salience score</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is your source for a variety of online marketing services.

So long as<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/differentiating-your-site-in-a-service-model-with-unlimited-competitors/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Once upon a time, consumers choose their health care providers based on proximity and services they provided. So long as providers could fulfill potential patients’ needs on those two factors alone, there was little reason for them to differentiate themselves from the competition. Today, however, that is no longer the case.</p>\r\n<h2>Web design strategies to set your practice apart from the competition</h2>\r\n<p>Today, if health care providers wish to attract new patients and keep existing ones, they must set themselves apart from the competition. While a big portion of the patient experience takes place in office, it really begins online. These digital marketing strategies can help your site stand out from the rest:</p>\r\n<h3>Play with format</h3>\r\n<p>Some types of content prove more effective than others in terms of engagement and rankings, but at Doctor Genius, we know from experience that no single type of content will appeal to every visitor. It makes sense to vary your content from time to time, even if doing so goes against the status quo for your industry. As a health care provider, you likely use long-form articles, short blog posts, original research, and case studies as the foundation of your strategy. However, you can expand your reach and grow your audience by incorporating one or more of the following formats as well:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Infographics</li>\r\n\t<li>Quizzes and polls</li>\r\n\t<li>Podcasts</li>\r\n\t<li>Webinars</li>\r\n\t<li>Email newsletters</li>\r\n\t<li>Video</li>\r\n\t<li>Health checklists</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Fill the gaps in competitors’ messaging</h3>\r\n<p>To differentiate yourself from the competition, Forbes suggests <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3\">stalking your competitors online</a>. Visit their websites, follow their blogs, like their Facebook pages, sign up for their email newsletters, and listen to their podcasts. Make note of the topics they routinely discuss and identify gaps. By either expanding on tired topics or broaching new ones, you can position yourself as an industry thought leader, an invaluable position to hold in the health or dental field.</p>\r\n<h3>Offer virtual tours</h3>\r\n<p>The health care industry has the unique challenge of helping potential patients overcome their phobias before they even schedule an appointment. One effective way to do this is through <a href=\"https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.\">virtual tours</a>. These allow potential patients to get to know every facet of your practice and to familiarize themselves with the environment before they set foot in your office. They also let you showcase special amenities you may have, such as X-ray machines, special kids’ activity areas, and recovery rooms. Live tours, especially those that contain voiceover narration, can give website visitors much-needed reassurance that you prioritize their comfort.</p>\r\n<h3>Use real photos</h3>\r\n<p>Visual elements are such an important part of any website, but not all imagery is created equal. According to findings from a Marketing Experiments study, prospective customers are <a href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested\">35% more likely to convert</a> when presented with real imagery as opposed to stock photos. While there are several reasons behind this, the takeaway is simple: Always use real photos when possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn about the PX, Patient Experience Package</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we pride ourselves on our ability to help clients build a custom branding and patient experience through digital marketing efforts.

However, dentists and medical professionals as a whole, need more than simple facts stated on a page. Starting out as a content writer, I strove to find the balance between providing well-researched academic information and speaking to a general audience. Writing for Doctor Genius has only improved my competence in authoring technical and patient-friendly medical content. In turn, my work and time with Doctor Genius have also enhanced our internal writing standards as I have become well-versed in what constitutes industry-best practices.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The three main areas I have learned to consider when writing for Doctor Genius are the sources or facts of the content itself, the SEO terminology, and creating comprehensible content in an easy-to-digest platform. My name is Nick Adams, and I am the Lead Editor at Doctor Genius, going on four years with the Company.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A Bit About Myself and the Content Team</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I started as a content writer at Doctor Genius in 2016, gradually working my way up to lead editor. Starting, I was the only in-house content writer. Now, as the lead editor, I mentor other writers and oversee our final product, creating greater quality control in every piece we produce. While I now focus more on editing and writing specialized content, my goal remains the same: improving our professionalism and readability standards, translating into improved client ranking, connecting more new patients to clients. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While the goal was the same, it was not easy to expand the styles and forms of content beyond what we had. After four years, I have been able to help the content department grow with the help of my manager, Alexander Hess. With his guidance, we continue to focus on quality over quantity while expanding our client’s ranking signals in authority and expertise through adding new digital assets.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One Step in the Overall Process</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Our writers’ editing process is more like a conversation, highlighting any corrections or changes to consider and sending it back to them for review. We strive to help our writers grow in their skills while also expanding their knowledge. Even after our writers complete the training, we encourage them to continue learning. When we assign a writer a custom content order, they will start researching the various keywords, the client’s medical specialty, and anything else they need to know.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even though the content department is only one part of the process, it is crucial to follow any instructions and strive for content that will help boost the client’s online presence. Once the writer finishes the content, I will review it and mark-up any changes they need to see before passing it back. After a final review, the content is ready to move on through to production for installation to the website.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- Start Author Panel -->\r\n<p>\r\n<style>\r\n    .author-panel {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-direction: row;\r\n        font-size: 1.0rem;\r\n        line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel.card {\r\n        padding: 2.5%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel p { line-height: 1.5 !important; }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel .panel-text {font-size: 14.5px !important; }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder {\r\n        width: 25%;\r\n        margin: 1% 2.5%\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder img, .author-info {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        max-width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .image-holder img {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        height: auto;\r\n        margin-bottom: 15px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info h5 {\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n        font-size: 100%;\r\n        text-decoration: underline\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info ul {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        padding-left: 0;\r\n        width: 100% !important;\r\n        justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel ul li {\r\n        list-style-type: none;\r\n        text-transform: uppercase;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .author-info li {\r\n        font-size: 75%;\r\n        font-style: italic;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .panel-text { width: 72.5%; margin-left: 2.5% }\r\n\r\n    .author-panel h5 { margin-bottom: 0)\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"author-panel card\">\r\n<div class=\"image-holder\"><img class=\"author-image alignnone wp-image-2430 size-thumbnail\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Adams - Lead Editor - Doctor Genius\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1445_Original-480x480.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><br />\r\n<div class=\"author-info\">\r\n<h5>Nick Adams</h5>\r\n<!-- Uncomment these to utilize: --><!-- <ul><li><a title=\"Author page coming soon!\" disabled>Posts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\">Bio</a></li>-->\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"mailto:nadams@doctorgenius.com\">Email</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel-text\">\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After graduating from Azusa Pacific University, with a BA in English-Writing Concentration, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-adams-27630344/\">Nick Adams</a> utilized his writing skills to build a professional career in writing. While at APU, Nick studied various forms and styles of writing, including journalism and technical writing. Before DG, Nick worked in other technical writing roles before shifting his focus on blogs and webpages associated with the medical field of addiction, mental health, and dual diagnosis treatment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2016, we brought Nick on as a Content Writer. Since then, Nick has written, edited, or overseen upwards of 300 separate custom content orders, written various forms of media text (blogs, video scripts, and press releases), and conducted quality control on written content. In total, he has worked on several thousand sites and clocked-in nearly a million words. His dedication, team spirit, and exceptional talent earned him a well-deserved promotion to Lead Editor last Winter. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Under the direction of the head of Content, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlhess/\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Alexander L Hess</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, MBA, Nick is poised to continue his professional-quality work with Doctor Genius. As he describes, “writing is a passion of mine, and I intend to take that passion into my everyday work. With my skills and experience, I plan to continue guiding our content department on our growth path and ensuring our clients receive the quality content they deserve.”</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End Author Panel -->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Quality Content Over Quantity</span></strong></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Creating quality content and helping oversee the creation of said content involves focusing on three main areas mentioned earlier: resources, SEO terminology, and comprehensible content.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Resources</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A major component of writing and editing content involves searching for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-importance-of-source-credibility/\">professional and credible resources</a>. Not only does this help our writers to learn better and understand the topic, but it also helps to flesh out the web pages for patients. The overall goal is to help patients learn and understand the specific service or treatment before scheduling an appointment. We focus on using .org websites, academic sources, and other information databases with this in mind.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SEO Terminology</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While the client has a list of keywords and terms relevant to their services, we strike a balance between SEO and comprehension. This way, the content is not weighed down with too many keywords to the point of being spam— this practice is often referred to as “keyword stuffing.” However, we still strive to use more technical or precise terms somewhere on a page to increase the chance of a patient searching that term online and finding our client’s website. This balance is struck by understanding <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-explains-the-difference-between-neural-matching-and-rankbrain/299713/\">neural matching</a>, which is writing content that will help a search engine present content that greatly matches a searcher&#8217;s intention. By working with our marketing team, we can determine the best course of action for each patient. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Comprehensible Content</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As an editor, I take the necessary time to read content for more than just errors. The content needs to be understandable for patients so that they are comfortable receiving medical services and are more likely to opt for the right treatment. At the same time, we strive to ensure it is factual and informative. This translates into clearly looking through every piece of content for its ability to reach the intended audience in a way that matches their specific needs. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to Start Getting High-Quality Content Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">By our content team continuing to grow, we will continue to offer more new digital assets that improve client ranking.
