Search engine giants like Google have started using a salience score to analyze and prioritize search results. To understand how entity salience can help your website perform better in the result rankings and improve search engine optimization, you first have to learn what an entity is and how salience applies to it.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding natural language processing</h2>\r\n<p>Google and other sites use natural language processing to determine the overall meaning of text content on a webpage. This function is carried out by an artificial intelligence program to identify what a real human would find important in a block of text. You can improve content management by focusing on entity salience, though it is important to note that entity salience is not the same thing <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\">as SEO keywords</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Entities</h3>\r\n<p>An entity is usually a specific word in a text that references a noun. For example, a person, a business, a product, and even a number may be recognized as entities within a body of text. A natural language processing AI can identify entities even when they are not specifically named, like when a named person is mentioned again in nominal form. The identification of these entities is the first step toward building a salience score.</p>\r\n<h3>Salience</h3>\r\n<p>When referred to an entity, salience means exactly what its <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience\">Merriam-Webster</a> definition is: being especially noticeable or conspicuous. In text, entities that are salient are those words that the AI detects as being important or prominent to a real person. This does not necessarily mean that someone who reads a website’s content will pick up on all those words. The AI simply uses its estimation of salient entities to create a score of readability and SEO popularity.</p>\r\n<h3>The salience score</h3>\r\n<p>Several factors contribute to how these entities are identified through natural language processing. From a single block of text, an entity may be chosen because of its location in the text, its grammar, if it is linked to sections of the sentence, and how much it stands out. Again, names, nouns, and pronouns all get bonus points in the process. The distinction between entities and keywords is incredibly important to content writers, as a writer can work to incorporate an entity and keyword closely together so that they both rank higher together.</p>\r\n<h2>Calculating your salience score</h2>\r\n<p>Since salience scores are not yet fully popularized and it is not clear how much they may improve website SEO, finding a website to calculate your score can be difficult. Lexalytics and the Google Natural Language API Demo are both options where you can type in text and see how it ranks. By experimenting with different types of texts, you can discover what entities get identified the most and how to write content around salience and SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about salience scores for your website</h2>\r\n<p>There is still a lot that needs to be explored with entity salience.

One strategy that many have not heard of focuses on semantic similarity and semantic distance to promote content based on the words themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Natural language processing</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b\">Natural language processing</a> is a tool that search engines use to help find content that matches a specific search. An AI identifies certain words in a section of text that it deems particularly important — more important than the rest of the text. These words are often nouns or pronouns, like names, businesses, numbers, and locations, and the AI picks them out to determine how a webpage should rank with related search terms. A good content writer can take these words and integrate them as relevant SEO keywords, producing a higher rank overall for a website.</p>\r\n<h3>Scoring term frequency</h3>\r\n<p>In every document, those specific words, called entities, can be matched with certain search words. However, not all-important terms in a document identically match someone’s search. The AI&#8217;s score is based on how often a word or term appears in the text. The more it appears, the higher it is ranked in terms of importance. However, if the same word or phrase appears across many texts online, its ranking may get lowered because its popularity indicates it is simply a general term (and is therefore not as important). Balancing these two factors is key in getting the most out of your document terms.</p>\r\n<h3>Scoring semantic similarity</h3>\r\n<p>&#8220;Semantic&#8221; refers to the meaning of words. When ranking similarities between words, natural language processing considers how two words may fall in the same category when compared to words that do not relate to them at all. This process can be helpful for finding websites that are relevant but may not contain the exact words in a user&#8217;s search.</p>\r\n<h3>Reducing semantic distance</h3>\r\n<p>Semantic distance is how far apart two words appear in natural language processing. By using words that relate to each other and so fall into the same categories, a writer can produce content that is more likely to be picked up by search engines looking for similar words. That said, beyond simply identifying content topics, with semantic similarity there is a greater chance of sites being organized and ranked based on content. This can make the rankings more convoluted, which is why including words that are similar to search terms can rank your site higher in regard to both organization and topic.</p>\r\n<h2>Find more ways to reduce semantic distance in your content</h2>\r\n<p>Reducing semantic distance can be a challenge when you do not fully understand how words and terms play into search engine rankings.

While we at Doctor Genius like to think of ourselves as a team of forward-thinking individuals, we tend to agree. It is true that negative word-of-mouth marketing can have a damaging effect on customers’ perceptions of a brand and, therefore, the brand’s profits, but the truth is that <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/danger-of-negative-word-of-mouth-wom/\">negative W-O-M is what you make of it</a>. If you do nothing about poor reviews or worse, try to hide from them, they will continue to haunt you. However, if you address them head-on and use them as learning mistakes, you can not only recover but can become better than you were before.</p>\r\n<h2>Negative W-O-M indicates loyalty</h2>\r\n<p>Back in 2011, LoyaltyOne, a Cincinnati-based company that provides loyalty marketing services to enterprises, announced a few <a href=\"https://customerthink.com/turning_a_frown_upside_down_how_negative_wom_can_help_your_brand/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://customerthink.com/turning_a_frown_upside_down_how_negative_wom_can_help_your_brand/\">changes to its AIRMILES Reward Program</a>. Among the changes was one that affected redemption requirements, which outraged many customers. While the brand fully expected some pushback, it was surprised by who was doing the pushback and why.</p>\r\n<p>According to the company’s reports, the most verbal (read: outraged) customers were those who the brand perceived to be their most valuable. These individuals were, on average, 70% more engaged with the rewards program than those who remained silent. The company realized that the negative comments stemmed from customers’ emotional connection to the brand that, prior to the program changes, was a positive one.</p>\r\n<h2>How to use negative W-O-M to your advantage</h2>\r\n<p>Regardless of who is posting negative comments about your practice, you can learn from LoyaltyOne’s response to the 2011 situation. In addition to monitoring customers’ responses throughout the entire commentary period, the brand also publicly clarified any inaccuracies and responded to specific questions. Its participation in the conversation offset the bad experience with a new, positive one. It also reinforced the brand’s core values that attracted the most engaged members in the first place. The overall result was that approximately one-third of outraged commenters ended up redeeming their points afterward.</p>\r\n<p>#1800Flowers is another major company from which you can learn, but unlike with LoyaltyOne, its experience teaches you what not to do. On February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2015, many 1-800-Flowers customers received wilted flower arrangements and half-crushed chocolates. Though the company has a long-standing reputation for delivering outstanding products, this single bad experience stuck with customers for months. Though it did issue a public statement apologizing for the incident, Spiegel Research Center suggests <a href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/news/1800flowersfail---negative-word-of-mouth-matters.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/news/1800flowersfail---negative-word-of-mouth-matters.html\">three other steps</a> it should have taken — and that you should consider if you fall victim to negative online marketing:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Create an opportunity for NWOM posters to re-experience your brand. </strong>Do not just issue a refund or apology. Provide the product or service again, but for free.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reach out to NWOM posters individually.</strong> So that those directly affected by your actions know that your apology is sincere and that you genuinely care about their opinions, reach out to them individually. Show that you are willing to listen, learn, and change.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Use negative W-O-M</strong> as an opportunity to participate in customer discussions and show followers that you take any complaints about your brand seriously.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Take control of your online reputation</h2>\r\n<p>As a leader in the online marketing space, Doctor Genius has the experience and know-how to help you overcome negative word-of-mouth through reputation management and a robust content strategy.
