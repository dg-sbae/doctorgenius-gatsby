The digital marketing landscape for healthcare is not as simple as posting a single comment on Facebook or sharing a special discount on Twitter. Navigating the digital marketing landscape can be more difficult than some might believe. To have success, a healthcare practice or company needs to be able to evolve with a constantly changing market.\r\n<h3>Times, they are a changing</h3>\r\nA strong online presence may not completely ensure a strong flow of patients or consumers, but it can increase the probability of reaching more patients through digital marketing. Business Insider cites a report from Custora that finds that “Organic search results accounted for 21 percent of US e-commerce orders,” in the first quarter of 2016, “representing the highest share of all marketing channels.”\r\n\r\nWhile searching online can produce a large variety of results, professionals can rank higher with the proper online presence. However, an online presence may not stand out among other practices in the digital landscape without other methods of creating a strong digital presence. Here are a few helpful hints to better navigate the digital marketing landscape when it comes to healthcare.\r\n<h3>A strong Call-to-Action</h3>\r\nA private practice needs to have an obvious Call-to-Action or “Why-to-Buy,” on the website. As simple as this might sound, a website that does not have a phone number or efficient forms of communication will lose clients. By having an easy means of communication, a reason that the client should seek the service and patient forms available on the website, the practice will help motivate people to seek their service.\r\n<h3>An easily-readable home page</h3>\r\nThe first page of a website that a potential patient lands on is a crucial factor for the individual remaining on the website or seeking information elsewhere. In many cases, a home page can share a possible deal the practice is currently offering or break down the main service of the company in easy-to-read and understandable forms. The patient needs to be able to understand the content at a quick glance, comprehend it and then decide if it is what he or she needs. The home page needs to direct people to other pages within the website that offer more details on the desired search result.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-320\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>An active social media presence</h3>\r\nWhile a social media presence on its own will not drastically increase the number of patients for a practice, it can greatly increase the number of possible patients. In a survey of over 1500 American adults, Pew Research Center finds that “Nearly eight-in-ten online Americans,” around 79 percent, use Facebook over other forms of social media. The same study finds that 24 percent use Twitter, 31 percent use Pinterest, while 32 percent use Instagram. Having a strong social media presence is an incredibly beneficial method for reaching consumers and potential patients.

From dentistry to chiropractic care, patients need to feel that the treatment they receive at the professional practice is having a positive and long-term effect on their overall condition. At Doctor Genius, we can help review methods for finding effective solutions to treat your patients.\r\n<h3>Finding the best solution is not easy</h3>\r\nWhile the main issue for any patient is always about treating pain, patients also need constant care and a practice they can trust. Patients are cautious to trust a medical practice until the practice proves that it is reliable, effective, honest and a strong source of support. The key factor, regardless of the situation, is support. We can help our Doctor Genius clients provide their patients with the care they need.\r\n\r\nWith various forms to fill out, insurance difficulties, payment options, scheduling conflicts and other factors, the treatment experience can be difficult and complicated for the patient. If the process becomes too complex or confusing, the patient is more likely to seek treatment elsewhere. A good support begins with the first phone call to schedule an appointment. Having a website with all the necessary information and forms the patient needs to fill out will also help ease the process.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the client can fill out the forms before visiting the office or fill them out in the waiting room. Regardless, the patient will have prior knowledge of the forms and what information will be necessary. The earlier the patient has this information, the more time the patient will have to ask any questions or address any concerns.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-334\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>Provide constant support during and after treatment</h3>\r\nIn order to build a strong relationship with patients and help ensure they return in the future, a practice needs to offer a solid support system during and after treatment. This does not mean that the practice needs to go above and beyond every single day. A solid support system means consistency when needing to answer questions, address concerns, being honest with patients and helping patients understand the treatment.\r\n\r\nDuring an appointment, regardless of the patient being established or new, the medical professional needs to address any concerns of the patient while maintaining a calm atmosphere. When a client comes to a dentist with a toothache, he or she is not only searching for treatment for a toothache, but also for a reliable source of treatment for other dental issues in the future.\r\n\r\nA patient may only need a simple checkup but will want to know that this practice will take his or her concerns to mind. Even if the patient does not need a follow-up procedure after the appointment, the patient will want to know what is next. The professional should go over what the patient needs to do to ensure complete recovery.

You need to have patients who will return for checkups after the initial visit. A strong Recall System will allow you to establish strong bonds of trust with the patient as a professional practice and ensure Patient Recall. While professionals can attempt to schedule appointments months ahead, the patient may move to another practice or cancel the appointment. Doctor Genius is hosting a webinar event for clients to learn new tips and methods for an improved Patient Recall System.\r\n<h3>The webinar event you don’t want to miss</h3>\r\nPatient Recall is a crucial step of anyone’s practice and not having an effective system in place can hinder the chance of patients returning. We will cover tips and methods for developing an effective Patient Recall System that will help retain patients and bring more through the doors. The webinar event will take place from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017.\r\n\r\nA few simple steps that are essential for effective patient recall include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Phone call reminders for a regular dental checkup</li>\r\n \t<li>Sending postcards with practice contact info to patients with reminder</li>\r\n \t<li>Creating an automated recall system</li>\r\n \t<li>Adding patients who do not reply to all reminders onto an overdue recall list</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhile many professional practices may pre-schedule the phone, email, or postcard reminders about an appointment, patients may still end up canceling. This webinar will cover how to implement effective recall methods into a practice.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-312\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-DG-Recall-System-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>New recall tactics from a professional consultant</h3>\r\nProfessional consultant, David Orr, owner of Alliance Dental Consulting in Irvine, CA, works to understand and develop dental practices to help them reach greater levels of success. Orr will share tips on his confirmation system with listeners during the webinar.\r\n\r\nThe confirmation system begins by sending a card in the mail or an email to the patient 28 days before the appointment, requesting confirmation. Since some patients may not respond immediately, consistency is key. Orr will also cover steps with basic recall, overdue recall, responding to missed appointments, unscheduled treatment and more. Orr will go over how to effectively continue keeping up contacting with the patient and increasing patient recall with his system in the webinar.\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we produce professional content for dental practices and help practices create a stronger online presence.
