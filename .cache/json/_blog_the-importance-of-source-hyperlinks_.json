Though there are several reasons brands engage in content marketing, these are the top three. According to Moz, companies strive to <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/google-e-a-t\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://moz.com/blog/google-e-a-t\">achieve E-A-T</a> for two reasons: To boost their reputations and to make Google happy. While you can use several content marketing techniques to appeal to target audiences and gain rankings, one of the simplest and best ways to do both is to hyperlink to your sources.</p>\r\n<h2>How hyperlinking helps build E-A-T</h2>\r\n<p>It is not uncommon for brands to avoid hyperlinking to the sources they use out of fear of sending visitors away from their sites. While this is a possibility, losing one or two readers is a small price to pay for establishing yourself as an authority and gaining the majority of visitors’ (and Google’s) trust. So how, exactly, does hyperlinking help build E-A-T? Below are the top four ways.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Build a network</h3>\r\n<p>If you have had other practices or industry authorities link to your content, you know just how precious a backlink can be. For each backlink you receive, you may notice a slight increase in your rankings, and you may feel a surge of gratitude that encourages you to pay the kindness forward. Other brands feel this way, too.</p>\r\n<p>By linking to other professionals within your field, as well as to industry experts, you put yourself on their radar and secure a soft spot in their hearts. When those professionals need to cite, say, a dental professional, they may think of you first. The more websites you link to, the more backlinks you stand to receive. A word of caution though: Link only to credible and relevant sites, as linking for the sake of linking could put you on Google’s radar for all the wrong reasons.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Boost credibility</h3>\r\n<p>A hyperlink is the content marketing equivalent of a footnote. Just as you had to do when writing a college paper or dissertation, cite your sources. Citing, referencing, or referring to the publications from which you gained your information tells your audience that you did your homework and are a source to be trusted.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Increase usability</h3>\r\n<p>Today’s consumers are more informed than ever before, and not because they have to be, but because they want to be. Most people do not take the information given to them at face value. They digest it, research it, and then research it some more before deciding what they want to do with it. Make things easier on your audience by applying hyperlinks to your content. Doing so allows them to easily verify your material, answer any questions they have, and find related content through which they can learn more.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Increase time-on-site</h3>\r\n<p>You do not always have to link to outside sources. If you have an extensive library of valuable content, make each piece work harder for you by sending your readers to them. In addition to including hyperlinks directly in the content, attach a list of “Related Content” at the bottom. These tactics have been proven to increase time-on-site, which also happens to improve search rankings.</p>\r\n<h2>Invest in your online reputation</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that reputation is everything for health care professionals.

Some states offer<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/keeping-patients-when-children-move-off-of-family-plans/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Per the Affordable Care Act, insurers phase young adults off their parents’ insurance plans by their mid-20s. Some states offer more flexibility and allow adult children to remain health care dependents until they are 30. As a provider, it is important that you understand your state’s particular rules and have a backup plan in place for when a young patient, inevitably, finds him or herself without coverage.</p>\r\n<h2>Age requirements for extended health care coverage</h2>\r\n<p>Prior to the passage of the ACA, 37 states had already adopted a policy that granted young adults the option to remain on their parents’ health plans beyond the age of 18. However, to protect those adults living in the 13 other states that have a hard cut-off age of 19, the Obama Administration included a provision within the Affordable Care Act that states a young adult can remain on a parent’s insurance plan until the age of 26. While states can continue with their existing state law requirements for extended coverage, they may not interfere with the application of the ACA.</p>\r\n<p>Per most states’ laws, the cut-off age was 25. Several state laws mandated that individuals be full-time students, unmarried, without dependents of their own, and residents of the state to qualify for benefits. Some went so far as to say that a dependent must reside in the same home as the policyholder. The ACA merely gave young adults in these states a year-longer grace period without severely disrupting insurers’ policies.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the extra year grace period, the ACA made it easier for young adults to <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/children-under-26/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/children-under-26/\">qualify for dependent coverage</a>. Per the law, any person younger than the age of 26 may remain on a parent’s health insurance plan even if the following apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The dependent starts or leaves school</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent gets married</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent is no longer considered a dependent for tax purposes</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent lives in or out of the family home</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent has or adopts a child</li>\r\n\t<li>The dependent was offered, but turned down, employer-based coverage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When coverage stops after a person turns 26 depends on the type of plan a parent has. If a parent has a marketplace plan, the dependent may remain on the policy until the end of the year he or she turns 26. The child must use the open enrollment or special enrollment period (whichever comes first) to apply for individual coverage. If a parent has a job-based plan, the dependent’s coverage ends at the end of his or her birthday month.</p>\r\n<h2>States with extended coverage</h2>\r\n<p>Several states grant young adults even more leeway by allowing <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/dependent-health-coverage-state-implementation.aspx\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/dependent-health-coverage-state-implementation.aspx\">extended dependent coverage up until the age of 30</a>. For instance, Florida allows young, unmarried individuals who do not have dependents of their own to remain on their parents’ plans until the age of 30. In Illinois, parents of dependents who are also veterans may do the same. Other states that extend dependent coverage beyond age 26 include Wisconsin (27), South Dakota (29), New York (30), Pennsylvania (30) and New Jersey (31). These states generally require an adult child to remain unmarried and dependent-free to qualify for extended coverage.</p>\r\n<h2>Special enrollment periods</h2>\r\n<p>As a health care provider, you have a responsibility to your patients to advise them on what they can do to improve their health and quality of life. Part of doing both involves ensuring patients have adequate coverage. If you learn that a patient is about to be phased off a parent’s insurance plan, encourage them to conduct research early on, as they have limited time to enroll in a new plan.</p>\r\n<p>Patients whose parents have marketplace coverage have a 120-day window to apply for coverage. This special enrollment window begins 60 days before one’s 26th birthday and ends 60 days afterward.</p>\r\n<p>The special enrollment period for individuals whose parents have employer-based coverage is slightly shorter. It begins 60 days before a person’s 26th birthday but ends only 30 days after the big day. Individuals who miss the special enrollment period must wait for <a href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/individual-and-family/2020-obamacare-open-enrollment-dates-by-state/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/individual-and-family/2020-obamacare-open-enrollment-dates-by-state/\">open enrollment</a>, which begins November 1st and ends December 15th. (California’s open enrollment period is slightly longer, beginning on October 15th and ending January 31st.)</p>\r\n<h2>Coverage options beyond 26</h2>\r\n<p>Most people are partial to their doctors or dentists and will do what is necessary to remain a patient. However, because cost is almost always a factor, you may lose a young patient who cannot afford your services to a cheaper competitor or clinic. You can take steps to prevent this from happening by informing patients of affordable coverage alternatives. Some options to discuss with young adults are as follows.</p>\r\n<h3>Shop through the exchange</h3>\r\n<p>The health care exchange is a young person’s best bet for finding affordable coverage. Advise patients that if their income is between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line, they may qualify for tax credits to help subsidize the cost of health care coverage.</p>\r\n<h3>Find coverage through school or an employer</h3>\r\n<p>Many universities offer affordable coverage to students. If a patient is not a student, encourage him or her to ask about job-based coverage.</p>\r\n<h3>Apply for Medicaid or CHIP</h3>\r\n<p>Medicaid is low- to no-cost health insurance available to individuals whose incomes fall below 138% of the federal poverty line. CHIP is a low-cost option for pregnant women.</p>\r\n<h3>Look into COBRA</h3>\r\n<p>COBRA allows a young adult to stay on their parent&#8217;s plan for up to 18 months after their 26<sup>th</sup> birthday. However, the policyholders must assume the cost of coverage, which can get expensive.</p>\r\n<h3>Check out catastrophic plans</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/catastrophic-insurance\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/catastrophic-insurance\">Catastrophic plans</a> are only available to people under 30. These plans come with high deductibles and assume the holder will not be using the benefits much, if at all. However, premiums are low, averaging about $173 per month.</p>\r\n<h2>We can help you retain patients</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius is #1 in new patient acquisition, and we are not too bad at patient retention, either.

However, the saying that all press is good press is not true. Negative WOM is very damaging to a brand’s reputation and bottom line, especially when the brand in question is an “underdog.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>The effects of negative WOM marketing</strong></p>\r\n<p>WOM marketing relies on first-hand accounts of a person’s experience with a business. First-hand accounts are immediately more credible than typical marketing, as consumers do not get paid to leave reviews. Brands use positive testimonials to attract new customers for this reason. However, whereas positive reviews increase trust and influence purchases, negative reviews have an adverse effect. Below are just a few ways NWOM can undermine the results from all other marketing efforts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Change in attitude toward a brand</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the findings from a study conducted by a <a href=\"https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;context=honors_theses\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&amp;context=honors_theses\">University of New Orleans</a>, consumers’ attitudes toward a brand are adversely impacted by negative reviews. The study focused on both “top dogs” and “underdogs.” While both big and small businesses saw a negative impact from public criticism, the underdogs suffered more from bad press than larger corporations. Additionally, participants’ perceived brand value decreased when they were presented with negative information about a company. Again, the drop was more significant for small brands than large ones.</p>\r\n<p>What is interesting is that positive reviews had little to no effect on participants’ perceptions of brands. This finding shows just how powerful negative word-of-mouth can be.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Change in purchase intention</strong></p>\r\n<p>Negative WOM does not just hurt a brand’s reputation. It also hurts a company’s bottom line. According to the study, negative reviews influenced participants not to make the purchase. Positive testimonials, however, had little to no impact on individuals’ purchase decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Findings from a <a href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/studies/online-negative-word-of-mouth.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/studies/online-negative-word-of-mouth.html\">Spiegel Research Center</a> study back those from the university: according to the center, individuals who viewed NWOM about a brand decreased their spending by 12% and their spending frequency by 5%.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Difficult to overcome</strong></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most frustrating thing about NWOM is its persistence. The impact of negative word-of-mouth marketing persists for far longer than the results of positive WOM. According to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322632227_Negative_Word-of-Mouth_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Adverse_Messages_on_Consumers'_Reactions_on_Facebook\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322632227_Negative_Word-of-Mouth_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Adverse_Messages_on_Consumers'_Reactions_on_Facebook\">2017 paper</a>, the impact of bad press persists long after it has been refuted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Managing your reputation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Reputation management is critical to the success of your practice.
