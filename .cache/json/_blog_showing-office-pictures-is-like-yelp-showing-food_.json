Among those challenges is your ability to incite trust in prospective patients, demonstrate competency of care, and encourage prospects to choose you over your competitors — all before they ever set foot in your office. While an up-to-date website, strong content, and patient reviews can go a long way toward helping you overcome several marketing challenges, original photos and detailed imagery may be just what you need to overcome the unique three.</p>\r\n<h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>\r\n<p>You can invest all your resources into beautiful web design, informative content, and strategic SEO, but without supplementing your efforts with high-quality imagery, your efforts may be for naught. According to Solve, websites that feature “good images” receive <a href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://solve.co.uk/seo-tips/importance-of-images-in-marketing/#:~:text=Poor%20quality%20images%20cheapen%20your,to%20achieve%20your%20business%20goals.\">94% more views</a> than those without photos or with low-quality images. Moreover, substandard photos may hurt your practice more than a lack of photos, as low-grade pictures send the impression that your brand is cheap, impersonal, and untrustworthy. The right photos, however, can do the opposite and help your practice overcome challenges one, two, and three.</p>\r\n<h3>Build trust</h3>\r\n<p>Original photography is one of the best ways to build trust in prospective patients. Real images give prospects a glimpse of who you are as a provider and what type of community you have created in-office. Genuine smiles on the faces of real patients and team members help prospects feel reassured that you operate a warm, welcome, and caring environment and that people are happy to be in your care.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, before and after photos of real patients let you live up to the adage of “show, don’t tell.” It is easy enough to state on your website that you specialize in full-mouth restorations, but convincing patients that this is true requires proof. An image gallery with clearly labeled before and after photos can serve as all the evidence you need, though it cannot hurt to accompany images with patient testimonials as well.</p>\r\n<h3>Demonstrate competency of care</h3>\r\n<p>Trust and competency go hand in hand. If a prospect does not trust that you can competently manage his or her care, he or she will not choose you despite your other redeeming qualities. Use imagery to provide a comprehensive and visual overview of your services, procedures, and outcomes, such as what we did with our <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/new-doctor-genius-video/\">new Doctor Genius video</a>. If you use high-tech equipment in your practice, go beyond original photos and use videos to demonstrate how it works. Do not be afraid to play with photos and video to guide prospects through the patient journey so they know what to expect. Finally, use imagery to educate patients on your services, address common health issues, and provide tips for how patients can protect their health.</p>\r\n<h3>Differentiate your brand</h3>\r\n<p>Last but not least, original photos are an effective way to set yourself apart from the competition. Whereas many brands still rely on stock imagery, whether because of time, cost, or unawareness, you can set your brand apart by offering a wholly transparent and honest look at your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Attract more patients with tailored solutions</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we focus solely on developing comprehensive digital marketing solutions for health care professionals.

Until recently, many thought the on-demand economy would be a passing trend, directed toward the young and wealthy. However, recent data shows that is far from the case, with <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-on-demand-economy-is-growing-and-not-just-for-the-young-and-wealthy\">30% of on-demand consumers</a> being between the ages of 35 and 54, and another 22% age 55 and older.</p>\r\n<p>As to be expected, the largest sector of the on-demand economy is online marketplaces. This is followed by transportation, with food and grocery coming in third. As a health care practitioner, you may assume you are not a part of this, but you would be wrong. On-demand health and beauty services account for $8.1 billion in consumer spending each year, and analysts anticipate spending will only grow with time. It is important that you adapt your content marketing strategy to accommodate this change and appeal to the on-demand market.</p>\r\n<h2>The power of listicles</h2>\r\n<p>While a strong content marketing strategy utilizes a variety of content types, consumers respond particularly well to lists and bullet points. The most popular women’s magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and Good Housekeeping have included listicles for decades.</p>\r\n<p>Listicles appeal to consumers’ need to lump things into round-numbered groups, a tendency that marketing scholars Robert M. Schindler and Mathew S. Isaac refer to as the “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674546?seq=1\">top 10 effect</a>.” According to the scholars, by lumping items into rounded numbered groups, such as “Top 10,” or “20 Best,” it becomes easier for consumers to process mass amounts of information quickly. Not only that, but it also helps them to make what they deem “more informed decisions” quickly.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, when a list details the “Top 10 On-Demand Health Care Services,” the 10 items within the list get particular notice. Consumers tend to consider other services that do not make the cut as “inferior.” This is true even of services that come in at number 11, even if the cause of that ranking is minimal or unknown. The impression most people get when viewing such a list is that if an item does not rank in the top 10, it is a level down.</p>\r\n<h2>What this means for your practice</h2>\r\n<p>According to Digital Journal, 30% of blog posts are lists, suggesting that you cannot go wrong with this format. In addition to aspiring to be a part of a Top 10 list by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\">leveraging technology</a>, you should create lists of your own. At Doctor Genius, listicles are one of our go-to content formats for driving engagement and guiding readers through the sales cycle. On behalf of our clients, we create lists on everything from the top dental restoration procedures to ways patients can improve heart health to the benefits of clear braces.</p>\r\n<h2>Leverage listicles to boost your rankings</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we are familiar with the most effective strategies for marketing health care and dental practices online. While we believe in the power of listicles, we also know that a tailored approach is key to driving user engagement and truly connecting with current and potential patients.

So long as providers could fulfill potential patients’ needs on those two factors alone, there was little reason for them to differentiate themselves from the competition. Today, however, that is no longer the case.</p>\r\n<h2>Web design strategies to set your practice apart from the competition</h2>\r\n<p>Today, if health care providers wish to attract new patients and keep existing ones, they must set themselves apart from the competition. While a big portion of the patient experience takes place in office, it really begins online. These digital marketing strategies can help your site stand out from the rest:</p>\r\n<h3>Play with format</h3>\r\n<p>Some types of content prove more effective than others in terms of engagement and rankings, but at Doctor Genius, we know from experience that no single type of content will appeal to every visitor. It makes sense to vary your content from time to time, even if doing so goes against the status quo for your industry. As a health care provider, you likely use long-form articles, short blog posts, original research, and case studies as the foundation of your strategy. However, you can expand your reach and grow your audience by incorporating one or more of the following formats as well:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Infographics</li>\r\n\t<li>Quizzes and polls</li>\r\n\t<li>Podcasts</li>\r\n\t<li>Webinars</li>\r\n\t<li>Email newsletters</li>\r\n\t<li>Video</li>\r\n\t<li>Health checklists</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Fill the gaps in competitors’ messaging</h3>\r\n<p>To differentiate yourself from the competition, Forbes suggests <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/26/13-content-marketing-strategies-to-differentiate-your-brand/#71cae6d605a3\">stalking your competitors online</a>. Visit their websites, follow their blogs, like their Facebook pages, sign up for their email newsletters, and listen to their podcasts. Make note of the topics they routinely discuss and identify gaps. By either expanding on tired topics or broaching new ones, you can position yourself as an industry thought leader, an invaluable position to hold in the health or dental field.</p>\r\n<h3>Offer virtual tours</h3>\r\n<p>The health care industry has the unique challenge of helping potential patients overcome their phobias before they even schedule an appointment. One effective way to do this is through <a href=\"https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://virtualtechdesign.com/dental-marketing-services#:~:text=Virtual%20Tours%20Elevate%20Your%20Dental,solution%20for%20all%20dental%20practices.&amp;text=Your%20virtual%20tour%20can%20help,%2C%20step%2Dby%2Dstep.\">virtual tours</a>. These allow potential patients to get to know every facet of your practice and to familiarize themselves with the environment before they set foot in your office. They also let you showcase special amenities you may have, such as X-ray machines, special kids’ activity areas, and recovery rooms. Live tours, especially those that contain voiceover narration, can give website visitors much-needed reassurance that you prioritize their comfort.</p>\r\n<h3>Use real photos</h3>\r\n<p>Visual elements are such an important part of any website, but not all imagery is created equal. According to findings from a Marketing Experiments study, prospective customers are <a href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/digital-advertising/stock-images-tested\">35% more likely to convert</a> when presented with real imagery as opposed to stock photos. While there are several reasons behind this, the takeaway is simple: Always use real photos when possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn about the PX, Patient Experience Package</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we pride ourselves on our ability to help clients build a custom branding and patient experience through digital marketing efforts.
