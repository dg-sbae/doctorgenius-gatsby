This strategic<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/sources-of-positive-pr-for-small-practices/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Engaging in public relations is an excellent way for local organizations to grow and promote their small practice. This strategic communications process helps businesses build a positive public image and develop beneficial relationships with the public. Public relations is not just for large businesses but is beneficial for smaller, local practices as well. It is possible to build your practice&#8217;s image without an expensive public relations agency. Here are some public relations activities that you can implement.</p>\r\n<h2>Earning Attention and Trust</h2>\r\n<p>Specialized knowledge or experience can give a practice a leg up on the competition. Share timely and relevant stories across channels to earn people&#8217;s trust and attention. An example of this is developing a list of professional tips to help prospective patients or other medical professionals in the community and publishing it in a local paper, magazine, or <a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6671-public-relations-solutions.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6671-public-relations-solutions.html\">popular online source</a>. </p>\r\n<h3>Knowing the Community</h3>\r\n<p>In small communities, events like sporting games, fairs or festivals, and fundraisers are excellent ways to get one&#8217;s name out in public. Practices can sponsor a sports team or concert, operate a booth at an event, or volunteer with a nonprofit charity. These activities will help with name recognition and also boost reputation. </p>\r\n<h3>Putting Together a Media Kit</h3>\r\n<p>A media kit is a collection of information about a business for the press. This kit provides reporters and editors with the information they need to write about the business. Media kits should be up to date and available at all times, as it is possible to make a connection with someone willing to promote one&#8217;s practice at any time.</p>\r\n<h3>Building Relationships</h3>\r\n<p>Relationships are essential to public relations, whether with reporters, media outlets, or social media influencers. Identify those who have influence and build those relationships. People and outlets like this have already earned their followers&#8217; trust, so the people and products they recommend are likely to be taken seriously. </p>\r\n<h3>Being Patient</h3>\r\n<p>Small practices can be impatient when it comes to producing results from public relations activities. It is important to remain patient as it can take three to six months to reap the benefits. Reputation development is a long-term investment that will build recognition and create trust over time.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a Positive Reputation</h2>\r\n<p>Small practices have very different marketing and public relations needs than large ones.

According to Solution Reach, patient attrition rates<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-retain-patients/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Patient retention is a more significant problem than patient acquisition for many medical practitioners. According to Solution Reach, <a href=\"https://www.solutionreach.com/infographics/6-ways-to-retain-your-patients\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.solutionreach.com/infographics/6-ways-to-retain-your-patients\">patient attrition rates hover between 10% and 30%,</a> on average. However, research shows that making patient retention an integral part of practice management can reduce attrition rates by as much as 70%. If patient retention is not among your practice&#8217;s top priorities, it should be. Read why patient retention is so important and learn some strategies that you can use to improve it.</p>\r\n<h2>Focusing on Patient Satisfaction</h2>\r\n<p>According to the data, 70% of patients leave a practice because of the practice&#8217;s indifference. That means that only 30% of patients leave because of uncontrollable factors like job loss, income reduction, relocation, and other major life events. This information shows that one of the best ways to raise retention rates is to create a better patient experience.</p>\r\n<p>Keeping patients happy by making them feel valued can improve retention. Some ways to do this are treating patients as partners in their healthcare journey and using compassionate bedside manners when interacting with them. Keeping patients informed and following up with them after an appointment can also result in better patient experiences and retention rates.</p>\r\n<h3>Lowering Wait Times</h3>\r\n<p>Patient satisfaction is also affected by the wait time. Medical practitioners with wait times around 60 minutes received an average satisfaction score of 53 from patients. However, those whose wait times no longer than 10 minutes had average satisfaction scores of 77. For every 10 minutes of additional wait time, scores dropped between six and 10 points. Try to keep the office running as smoothly and efficiently as possible to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction.</p>\r\n<h3>Making Healthcare Convenient</h3>\r\n<p>Younger generations value convenience across all aspects of their lives, including healthcare. Convenience is among their top five priorities. Here are some elements of convenient healthcare:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Ability to get test results without seeing a doctor</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Ability to view health information in one place</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Convenient location and hours</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Convenient scheduling</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Easy check-in</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Online bill pay</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Online registration</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Wait time visibility</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Offices that are not doing any of the above may want to update their processes.</p>\r\n<h3>Asking for Feedback</h3>\r\n<p>A practice can not know how its patients feel unless they ask. <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-location-for-feedback-can-solve-management-problems/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-location-for-feedback-can-solve-management-problems/\">Incorporate ways to solicit feedback</a> from patients, both in-office and online.

This tactic is particularly helpful for smaller practices because it is less expensive. This kind of marketing takes place naturally over time and can help draw in new patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Generating Website Growth Organically</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/paid-organic-marketing-strategy-blog/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/paid-organic-marketing-strategy-blog/\">Salesforce</a>, organic marketing is an excellent way to increase website traffic and landing page viewership. Instead of paying for ads or sponsored posts, traffic is generated naturally over time through organic marketing. Check out these examples of organic marketing and how it is beneficial.</p>\r\n<h3>Blog Posts</h3>\r\n<p>Blogs are a great way to reach a large audience online, whether it is one&#8217;s content or someone else&#8217;s. Linking back to blogs on social media is a great way to increase organic traffic to a practice&#8217;s website. Being featured in a blog post can also help gain recognition among members of the local community. Reaching out to writers and asking them to include a website link in a blog can also encourage web traffic. Each time a practice is mentioned in a blog or on another web page, it can help improve its search engine ranking.</p>\r\n<h3>Social Media Posts</h3>\r\n<p>Social media is another aspect of organic marketing. When patients post about a practice or<a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/\"> share its content</a> on social media, it is an opportunity for their followers to not only read the post but repost it themselves. The number of people reading about the practice can thus grow exponentially. One can also use social media marketing to boost organic reach by sharing their website&#8217;s content on social media. With the wide variety of social media platforms available, organic marketing is significant and takes place constantly.</p>\r\n<h3>Case Studies</h3>\r\n<p>Another organic marketing activity is creating case studies. These case studies can be about different topics like interesting cases to specialty treatments. This information provides helpful information for other patients dealing with similar concerns and can attract patients who were unaware of those treatments. Having a case study published can be a great way to promote services and gain credibility.</p>\r\n<h3>Email Blasts</h3>\r\n<p>Emails sent to existing or prospective patients are also organic marketing. These emails can be about a new service offering or a more advanced treatment method. Updating previous patients with these emails can be an effective way to help them remember one&#8217;s practice and possibly spread the information organically to the people around them.</p>\r\n<h2>Feel Confident About Your Marketing Strategy</h2>\r\n<p>Organic marketing is one possible element of an effective marketing strategy.
