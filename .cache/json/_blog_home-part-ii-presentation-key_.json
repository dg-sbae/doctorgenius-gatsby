There are several reasons why proper presentation for a website can bring in new patients or push them away, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Fully-functional website</li>\r\n \t<li>Mobile-first website</li>\r\n \t<li>Relevant content and background information</li>\r\n \t<li>Links to reviews</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are only a few of the necessary tools a website will need. When a patient is searching for a new doctor, dentist or other medical practice, a strong website can provide an accurate depiction of the professional services available. Without a stable and effective website, potential patients will look elsewhere for the care they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fully-functional website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a survey on Mashable.com, they measure the general health care trends for patients online. One statistic displays that 69 percent of parents will seek medical answers on WebMD instead of contacting a real doctor, while 40 percent will search Wikipedia, 22 percent on Facebook and 20 percent on YouTube. With the internet being such a popular platform for people seeking medical advice, your website can be a source of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is great to have information on a website, it is important to have a website that actually works properly. At Doctor Genius, we will run continual maintenance on the website and post content on a regular basis to ensure that the website is actively reaching new patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Statistic Image 1\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-975\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct31-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile-first website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The technology in smartphones continues to evolve and allow people to accomplish more with such a small device. In fact, Demi &amp; Cooper Advertising and DC Interactive Group find that 19 percent of smartphone users have at least one health app on their phone. While an app may not be as useful for a medical practice, having a mobile-friendly website can. Since most people use their phone or tablet devices to use Facebook, Instagram, search the internet and send emails, there is a high chance that they will look up medical professionals on those devices as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mobile-first website will change the architecture of the web pages to match the screen of the device. This way, when people search for your website on their phone, it will adapt and display everything properly instead of cutting off pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Relevant content and background information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with the client to cover all of their relevant background information and content to advertise their services. By including this information, potential patients receive a trust signal in knowing that the medical professional has relevant information on a fully-functional website. This information also promotes starting a conversation about the patient’s health needs with the professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Links to reviews</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By including patient reviews on the website, people will not have to search elsewhere and can clearly see what people enjoyed about your medical services. We can also link to these websites for patients to see more reviews and vice versa. People will find the reviews online and visit the website. Thus, this system draws in more patients from across the web to your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

Without one set in place, the user will have more difficulty navigating the website. If there is too much difficulty in navigating a website, the potential patient will search elsewhere. If a patient is searching for information on regular dental checkups at a specific practice and is interested in what the website states, then he or she may also search another page for more information on scheduling an appointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if the website is difficult to navigate, then the patient will be more likely to “bounce” to another website. Bounce is a term for when an individual leaves after only viewing a single page on a website and seeks to view other pages from a different website. The longer a potential patient spends on a website, the better chance that the patient will schedule an appointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Doctor Genius offers clients a mobile first website that renders the webpage to accurately display on any screen size. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Another reason that navigation bars are crucial for the success of a website is that they offer fast and efficient use of a website. In this day and age, people do not enjoy having to wait for anything. People want it fast and want it now. Thus, a navigation bar allows for people to immediately search for the specific service they need. Although, there is a new platform that has taken over many homes and the process for how people use the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile first technology</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"5120\" height=\"3837\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-989\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog.jpg 5120w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-1024x767.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/study-nov7-blog-177x133.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5120px) 100vw, 5120px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>The Pew Research Center finds that as of 2016, at least 95 percent of Americans own a cellphone of some kind. PEW also finds that around 77 percent of adults in America use smartphones. With smartphones, people are now able to search the internet and complete a variety of other tasks with ease. Thus, having a mobile first website is crucial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile first means that the website renders the size to match the screen of the user’s device. A medical professional needs a mobile first website so that there are no issues finding a search bar on a phone or tablet. More and more people conduct searches on these devices while watching TV or relaxing at home, instead of using a computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we offer clients the option to customize the navigation bar to the top/scrolling, top/static, or left/static of the webpage. This menu option will change with any device to accurately match the screen size. By investing in Doctor Genius, we can build your website to not only be mobile first but also be easier to navigate. With the proper navigation, people are less likely to leave your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

You want the user experience to be positive and beneficial enough that the individual does not leave the website. While it is fairly easy to build a homepage, it is much more difficult to determine what one needs to put on that homepage and where. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Presentation and representation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While many medical professionals may assume that they do not need a website and rely on word of mouth or reviews on platforms such as Yelp!, a website can reach many more potential patients. Not only expanding a medical professional’s reach, a website can also help to create a platform for patient-professional conversation. However, the content on a home page can make or break a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a home page is too difficult to navigate or does not explain what the professional does in an effective way, then the potential patient is most likely to search elsewhere. Here are a few key factors Doctor Genius implements into a client’s homepage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Navigation bar</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An important tool for any website, a navigation bar is crucial for helping people find what they need. While there will be ads and content on the homepage that may direct the user, the user may be interested in a service that is not the medical professional’s main one. We can customize tabs for various services and information for an easier user experience. This way, the user will not leave a website due to confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-968\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct24-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Calls to action</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A home page needs at least one call to action but will benefit from several. Since most medical practices cover multiple procedures, highlighting specific services in these procedures can be extremely beneficial for the professional. Website users will then be able to see specific services immediately upon using the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Curatti.com states that 70 percent of small business websites do not have clear calls-to-action on their homepage.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Images</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having images to support the written content will help give a clear indication of the services. Along with that, the images can help create a style for the website and capture the emotion that patients feel after using the service. Images also promote presentation of the homepage. At Doctor Genius, we place images in crucial locations to help tie the text with a visual cue to reach the reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Location, location, location</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can also help ensure that all necessary information is above the fold. Meaning that when a client first views the homepage, all necessary information is there. We also focus on the placement of information based on users’ habit of reading left to right. With this in mind, we utilize the “Z-pattern,” to help highlight the most crucial areas of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
