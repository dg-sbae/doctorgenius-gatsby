Having the right human resource standards<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-small-practices-handle-hr/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>It can be difficult for small practices to navigate the world of human resources. Having the right human resource standards in place is an essential part of running a business and taking care of employees. Here are some ways to make sure your practice is compliant with all the human resources rules and regulations that impact your employee relationships.</p>\r\n<h2>Creating a Safe and Enjoyable Workplace</h2>\r\n<p>One way of ensuring that a practice has a safe and enjoyable workplace for employees is knowing and following all employment laws. There are regulations for all aspects of employee hiring, retention, and termination processes. Information is accessible in the <a href=\"https://www.employmentlawhandbook.com/federal-employment-and-labor-laws/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.employmentlawhandbook.com/federal-employment-and-labor-laws/\">Federal Employee Handbook</a>, and additional updates to local and federal regulations are available in newsletters and websites.</p>\r\n<h3>Attracting and Hiring Quality Employees</h3>\r\n<p>Small practices can also benefit from effective hiring processes. HR can manage the risks during the hiring process and reduce the probability of a bad hire. Providing great benefits, competitive compensation, growth opportunities, and <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/mental-physical-and-emotional-support-resources-for-medical-teams-2/\">other resources</a> can help build a good employer reputation. HR can help practices stay in tune with employees and determine what benefits they care about the most. Creating this type of working environment not only attracts quality talent but also encourages employee loyalty.</p>\r\n<h3>Create an Employee Handbook</h3>\r\n<p>An employee handbook is a valuable resource for employer and employee communication. While an employee handbook can help in a dispute, it is also an excellent way to define employee expectations and specify job descriptions clearly. Make sure to update the handbook as the practice grows or processes and procedures change.</p>\r\n<h3>Payroll</h3>\r\n<p>Double-check payment amounts before finalizing employee paychecks, especially when using an automated payroll program. Paying employees correctly and on time is one of the easiest ways to earn their trust, and failing to do so is one of the fastest ways to lose it. Setting and sticking to a payment schedule and remaining compliant with how employees are classified can be critical steps to avoiding payroll issues. </p>\r\n<h3>Taxation</h3>\r\n<p>Practices should also be aware of which taxes they need to report and deposit. A few types of taxes to be aware of are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Federal income tax</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Federal unemployment</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Medicare taxes</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Social security </p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Employers and employees share the responsibility for making sure to report taxes properly. </p>\r\n<h3>Management Services</h3>\r\n<p>Managing employees can be one of the most challenging HR tasks. Proper processes for handling situations like employee termination and workers&#8217; comp claims are essential. Having clear plans in place for these events will allow practices to manage them professionally and legally.</p>\r\n<h2>Contact Us for More Information</h2>\r\n<p>Although human resources may seem challenging for a small practice, there are ways to make it easier to manage.

Here are some simple practice management tips that you can use to impact your incoming revenue significantly.</p>\r\n<h2>Establish Clear Patient Expectations</h2>\r\n<p>NextLevel Practice believes the way a practice <a href=\"https://nextlevelpractice.com/blog/what-is-your-money-mindset/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://nextlevelpractice.com/blog/what-is-your-money-mindset/\">handles cash flow</a> can make or break it. Inform patients about payments and insurance before treatment. Doing this can result in receiving payment upfront or in a more timely manner.</p>\r\n<h3>Verify Insurance Before Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Patients often wrongly assume how much their insurance will cover their treatment. This assumption can cause practices to wait longer to receive a payment if the patient cannot make the difference upfront. Verify patient eligibility and coverage before treatment. Doing this informs the patient about how much they owe and allows them to prepare their payment. <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/\">List accepted insurance plans online</a> so that patients can also verify that their current plan is compatible.</p>\r\n<h3>Try to Collect Payment at the Time of Service</h3>\r\n<p>Although one should not expect every patient to pay off their balance in full, it is beneficial to try and ask every patient when they come to the office. Be prepared for patients that ask for options to spread their payment out. Walk them through the process of paying their balance and be specific about how to make payments. Process statements as quickly as possible as the longer it takes for patients to get a bill, the less likely the practice will receive payment at all.</p>\r\n<h3>Take Advantage of Technology</h3>\r\n<p>Gone are the days of waiting a month for payment after mailing out a patient&#8217;s statement. Patients can now make payments online in a matter of minutes. Online payment options can shorten wait times by about three weeks. Offering online bill pay is one of the easiest ways to achieve a zero balance office. </p>\r\n<h3>Ensure Appropriate Staffing Levels</h3>\r\n<p>Problems can arise when there are not enough employees to manage the number of patients. Details like checking patient invoices and promptly mailing out statements can be some of the first things to fall through the cracks. Check with team members and ensure that they have enough time and resources to deliver accurate and timely statements and process payments.</p>\r\n<h2>Get the Support You Need</h2>\r\n<p>Practice management is an important part of running a successful practice.
