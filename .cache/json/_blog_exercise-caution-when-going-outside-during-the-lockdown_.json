The question is no longer &#8220;will it hit your neighborhood.&#8221; Now, you should be asking &#8220;by when.&#8221; Like many others, you would probably like to know what to do when handling day-to-day situations to avoid infection. </p>\r\n<p>Among an onslaught of questions we hear, one that appears often is whether it is safe to even go outside. Here are a few tips other medical professionals are offering in regard to this question.</p>\r\n<h3>Preventing the Illness</h3>\r\n<p>It is important to note that during an outbreak of COVID-19, the main focus of a lockdown is to slow the spread of it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, states that <a href= \"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html\" target=\" _blank\">COVID-19 is spread</a> &#8220;Between people who are in close contact with one another,&#8221; and &#8220;Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&#8221;\r\nThe CDC adds that many places where a large number of people gather may shut down during a lockdown. This can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Community centers</li>\r\n<li>Schools</li>\r\n<li>Offices or places of work</li>\r\n<li>Movie theaters</li>\r\n<li>Large events/gatherings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img src=\"/blogimg/exercise-caution-corvid-inline.jpg\" alt=\"Be careful in large crowds or parks\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1987\" />\r\n\r\n<p>So, while going outside will not immediately mean a person contracts COVID-19, that does not mean that people should spend too much time outside. In fact, limiting one&#8217;s time outside can help decrease the risk of contracting COVID-19 from another person. Unless there is a national warning to remain indoors put into effect, people can go outside when absolutely necessary.</p>\r\n<h3>Steps to Take When Outside</h3>\r\n<p>Even though people are able to go outside, there are precautionary steps people can take to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p><b>Frequently Wash Hands with Soap and Water</b></p>\r\nThe <a href= \"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html\" target=\" _blank\">United States Department of Labor</a> and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration gives details on controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the office space. The Department of Labor states that regardless of specific exposure risks, it is crucial to &#8220;Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>This advice not only applies to employees in the workspace but to people of all ages in any setting. It is crucial to wash the hands and decrease the risk of contracting the condition.</p>\r\n<p><b>Avoid sharing food or drinks</b></p>\r\n<p>Whether someone is going out for a meal or with friends, do not share food or drinks. The CDC states that &#8220;Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms.&#8221; People who do not display signs of COVID-19 can still be contagious. Avoid sharing food and drinks to decrease the chance of spreading it.</p>\r\n<p><b>Clean surfaces when in public</b></p>\r\n<p>Before using a surface, such as a table at a restaurant or bench at a park, it is crucial to keep the surfaces clean. Ensure the surface was wiped down before using it to prevent the risk of interacting with germs and potential areas that are contaminated with the virus.</p>\r\n<p><b>Avoid large community events and gatherings</b></p>\r\n<p>In many cases of a virus such as COVID-19 spreading, public gatherings and events may close down. Schools may close to prevent the risk of the virus spreading through children. Community centers, churches, movie theaters, and more may temporarily close. In the cases of colleges closing, some may have students work from home.</p>\r\n<p>Place of employment may do the same thing, choosing to have employees complete work remotely and not come into the office.</p>\r\n<h3>Seek the Information You Need</h3>\r\n<p>When it comes to your health, it is crucial to seek information from a credible source. If you have any concerns about COVID-19, reach out to your medical professional for more information. While outside, exercise caution in interaction with other people and limit the amount of time you spend outside. It is important to note that protocol for dealing with COVID-19 and going outside may change in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Review credible online sources and news stations for current updates. If you believe that you or a loved one has symptoms, contact your medical provider for instructions on treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

You may be asking yourself what you should do to prepare for COVID-19. There are many things to consider in the wake of a pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Having a plan in place may assuage any anxieties you have about contracting the virus and protecting yourself from it.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider Your Household</h3>\r\n<p>All household members should consult with each other to determine what will be done if there is an outbreak in the community. Some populations are more at risk for suffering complications from coronavirus than others. According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/get-your-household-ready-for-COVID-19.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), vulnerable groups include older adults and those with chronic health problems.</p>\r\n<p>If you or a loved one falls into one of these categories, please consult with a healthcare professional for guidelines one how to reduce the chances of infection.</p>\r\n<h3>Food to Stock Up On</h3>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/pandemic\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Homeland Security</a>, individuals should store a two-week supply of water and food before a pandemic strikes. Individuals can shop for the same foods they normally would, provided they are nutritious and do not have a short shelf-life. Frozen fruits and vegetables are best, as are nutritious non-perishables.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that there is an adequate supply of any needed prescription drugs. Try to get a 30-day supply, if possible. Other health supplies (like nonprescription drugs, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins) should also be sufficiently stocked.</p>\r\n<img src=\"/blogimg/how-to-prepare-for-corvid-inline.jpg\" alt=\"How should I prepare for the Coronavirus?\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Supplies You Need</h3>\r\n<p>Though it is essential to stock up on needed supplies in case of emergency, individuals should also keep in mind that hoarding is not the answer. Across the globe, some stores have been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/health/toilet-paper-shortages-novel-coronavirus-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">undergoing a notorious shortage of toilet paper</a> due to the coronavirus crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s recommendation is that people have enough supplies to last them for two weeks at home. Prioritize basic toiletries and cleaning supplies, along with any needed supplies for children or pets. &#8220;Panic buying&#8221; may lead to a shortage of supplies for others, thus increasing a community&#8217;s overall vulnerability.</p>\r\n<h3>The Real Threat of COVID-19</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Still, the organization is optimistic that the virus can be &#8220;suppressed and controlled&#8221; with the proper planning and investment of resources. We do not yet know how severe the illness can be.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/health-information/coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">National Institutes of Health</a> states that &#8220;For the majority of people, the immediate risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low.&#8221;</a></p>\r\n<p>Taking the right preventive measures and having a plan in place, however, may help lessen any personal impact.</p>\r\n<h3>Preparation Can Be Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>Just hearing the word &#8220;pandemic&#8221; can be intimidating. Planning for a potential quarantine can be a proactive way to lessen any feelings of fear and lessen your chances of contracting the disease. It is important to remember that one individual&#8217;s actions may help protect an entire community.</p>\r\n<p>Taking preventive measures may also help you feel less stressed about potentially catching coronavirus.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Just seven days later, the case was confirmed to be related to a novel coronavirus: known now as COVID-19. By the end of January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a global health emergency. Then, on Wednesday, the organization moved the status of the virus to a pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Since the first reported cases of the disease in Wuhan, there are now a total of <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\" target=\"_blank\">127,863 confirmed cases</a> (1,323 in the U.S.) and 4,718 deaths from the disease worldwide, according to John Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering.</p>\r\n <h3>What Is Coronavirus?</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">According to the WHO</a>, coronavirus is a family of viruses that cause a variety of illnesses, from the common cold to SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. These viruses are zoonotic, meaning that they pass from animals to people. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, the official name of the coronavirus currently spreading is COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Mild to severe respiratory issues</li>\r\n<li>Fever</li>\r\n<li>Cough</li>\r\n<li>Shortness of breath</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It is considered a novel virus, the word “novel” indicating that the virus is a previously undiscovered strain of coronavirus. It is a respiratory illness which spreads from person to person.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does It Spread?</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 appears to be highly transmittable. People can catch the virus from others who have the virus, even before the infected individual is showing symptoms. The disease can spread between people who are within six feet of each other, and through droplets created by an infected individual who coughs or sneezes. Although it is not the primary route, people can acquire the virus by touching an infected surface, followed by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>\r\n<p>An aspect of COVID-19 that may make it an especially spreadable virus is how it can transmit between people before the infected individual even shows any symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms are mild, so the infected individual may spread the virus before realizing they are sick. The <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001737?query=featured_home\" target=\"_blank\">New England Journal of Medicine</a> reported that COVID-19 is at peak infectiousness just as the individual begins to feel sick.</p>\r\n<h3>Who Is at Risk for Severe Illness From Infection?</h3>\r\n<p>Those over the age of 60 and people who have chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, and cancer are at a greater risk of developing severe symptoms from COVID-19. For those over the age of 80, the mortality rate stands at 15%, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173157/coronavirus-health-effects-age-covid-risk-diabetes-hypertension-disease-isolation” target=\"_blank\">WHO report that pooled over 72,314 cases in China</a>. That said, it is difficult to accurately identify all of the factors that leave people susceptible to developing serious illness at this time.</p>\r\n<p>There appears to be no evidence that children are more likely to catch the disease. Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/children-faq.html\" target=\"_blank\">the CDC reports</a> that severe complications from COVID-19 in children are uncommon. However, disease spreading can happen quicker among children because of frequent exposure to germ-rich areas like schools. The CDC also recommends that parents teach their children to have good hygiene practices and keep them up to date on all vaccinations.</p>\r\n<h3> What COVID-19 is Like and When to See a Doctor</h3>\r\n<p> Researchers found that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150748\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 99% of individuals</a> developed signs of COVID-19 within 14 days of initial infection. The severity of the symptoms depends partly on the person’s immune system and age; however, those infected may experience respiratory symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath. Additionally, the virus may induce a fever. Cases can present symptoms that range from mild to severe.</p>\r\n<p>Health care professionals recommend that those who are sick with any illness like the cold or flu stay home. If a fever accompanies the symptoms progress and, they recommend you call your healthcare provider. If you have symptoms after recently traveling to an area infected with COVID-19, or have come in close contact with someone who has the virus, the CDC recommends you find help from a medical professional.</p>\r\n<h3>How to Prevent the Spread of Covid-19</h3>\r\n<p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the WHO recommends for you stay home if you are ill. It is critical to follow other guidelines like covering your mouth with the crease of your elbow when coughing and sneezing into disposable tissues.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth, as the virus can enter the body this way. Unless you have COVID-19, or are caring for a person with a suspected COVID-19 infection, the WHO does not recommend wearing a facemask.</p>\r\n<p>The WHO does recommend washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water. People should also maintain social distancing, maintaining at least three feet of distance between yourself and other people.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, stay informed on the ongoing development of COVID-19 and contact your personal healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about how to protect yourself from COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
