Even with a website and digital presence, medical professionals will experience difficulty in reaching clients of all ages. The fastest growing buying group in the market and the age group professionals seem to have difficulty marketing to more than others, is millennials. Fortunately, Doctor Genius is working with other companies to offer a CE event on the best methods for marketing to millennials.\r\n<h3>Event details</h3>\r\nThe event itself takes place at the Marriott Courtyard in Sherman Oaks, CA, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on February 16, 2016. The registration fee is $25, which includes dinner provided at the event. Others can attend this continuing education (CE) class to earn three credits as well. The focus of the event is to showcase proven marketing methods that attract and return millennial clients including:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Active websites packed with fresh, unique and tailored content for specific practices</li>\r\n \t<li>Effective branding strategies to give practices an edge in competitive markets</li>\r\n \t<li>The importance of active social media profiles</li>\r\n \t<li>The most effective retention methods to promote client loyalty</li>\r\n \t<li>The use of search marketing to find the keywords that clients select most</li>\r\n \t<li>Management of your practice reviews to follow what current clients are saying</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis event will cover many more topics and information on reaching millennial clients. For the event, Doctor Genius is collaborating with Patterson Dental, Bank of America, Nickerson Consulting, Revenue Well and CARR Healthcare Realty. Experienced speakers from these companies, operating in today’s competitive market, will present proven methods of reaching and retaining millennial clients.\r\n<h3>Easier said than done</h3>\r\nThe PEW Research Center finds that 81 percent of millennials are on Facebook and that only 19 percent of millennials “say that most people can be trusted.” This statistic makes it even more crucial for medical professionals to be able to build a strong bond to retain millennial clients. Millennials are a large group of possible clients who mainly connect with each other over social media platforms. A practice that has a successful online presence and active accounts in the digital market can effectively reach millennials.\r\n\r\nWhile most people can construct a website for any known service, keeping the website active, healthy, updated and on the first page of search results is difficult to do. Doctor Genius offers these services and more, using this CE event to go over the most effective methods for maintaining a strong presence among millennial clients. The event will have a plethora of advice from top industry speakers and marketing advice from companies of various backgrounds.

A call tracking number is a unique phone number that you can assign to a specific marketing campaign so that when you receive a phone call, you know which advertisement was effective and invest more resources towards it. Simultaneously, you can tell which campaigns were a dud. Call tracking numbers can also be used when you are testing landing pages or your website to determine which CTAs are generating results. The benefits of using a call tracking solution is that it provides you with the data you need to adjust your marketing strategy to improve your results.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to SEO, however, you need to be careful in how you use this solution. Particularly when it comes to your business listings. Your name, address, and phone number (NAP) should be the same so that the search engines view your listings as having accurate data. While it could be useful to know if you are getting calls off of your Google local business listing vs. your Bing local listing, the risk of splitting your citation equity may not be worth it.\r\n\r\nInstead, use call tracking numbers in ways that is effective and will not negatively harm your SEO. For example, when you are running an AdWords campaign, you can use call tracking numbers, Google extensions, or Google forwarding numbers. If you are running three ads, one with variations of the keyword “teeth cleaning”, another with “dental veneers”, and a third with “dental implants”, you could assign a unique tracking number to each one. That way if someone calls directly from your ad, you can tell which one led to offline conversions. That is the power of a call tracking number. Someone can see your information, pick up the phone, and you will know how they found out about you.\r\n\r\nYou can also use call tracking phone numbers on landing pages that you are optimizing. Many businesses do so when promoting a specific campaign. In the example of a local dentist, you may want to run a package promotion that offers dental implants at a discounted rate. Not wanting to lose full price business, a landing page can be used to advertise the promotion, attract new customers through organic SEO, and sell implants without disrupting normal business. In this case, a call tracking phone number should be used so that team members can tell how the customers came in contact with the dental office and offer the appropriately discounted rates.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit to call tracking comes from being able to test out the effectiveness of your website or of specific CTAs. By placing a unique phone number on each CTA, you can determine how far down the page people are reading and which offer or content leads them to act. Once you have finished testing your site, you can change the phone numbers back to the same one that is on your local business listings.\r\n\r\nThere are additional ways that call tracking numbers can be useful, including on offline advertising campaigns. When it comes to SEO, you should practice caution and be sure that your NAP is consistent across all platforms.
