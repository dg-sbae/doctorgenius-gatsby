While you, as a health<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-set-kpis-for-a-medical-practice/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Many service providers often measure the success of their businesses using profit and loss statements. While you, as a health care provider, may also place a huge emphasis on profits, your most telling indicator of success is the health and happiness of your patients. This may lead you, like many practitioners, to assume you do not need to set, measure, and analyze traditional key performance indicators. This could not be further from the truth.</p>\r\n<h2>An overview of KPIs</h2>\r\n<p>In a nutshell, key performance indicators refer to set of a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kpi.asp\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kpi.asp\">quantifiable markers</a> that business leaders use to gauge the short- and long-term success of their efforts. Though KPIs are used to measure a number of operational and strategic achievements, you can use them to assess just about any area of your practice and even gauge its success compared to competitors’. The most common types of KPIs are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Process: </strong>Process KPIs focus on the efficiency, consistency, and/or quality of specific processes that were designed to achieve certain outcomes.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Outcomes: </strong>These indicators relate to the impacts or accomplishments that certain processes achieve. Outcomes are typically classified in one of two ways: End outcomes, such as appointments or patient retention, and intermediate outcomes, such as increased practice awareness.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Input: </strong>These KPIs measure the type, amount, and quality of resources a practice may use in the efforts to achieve a certain outcome.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Output: </strong>Output measurements indicate how much work was completed and define what was produced.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Project: </strong>These KPIs involve the status of deliverables and the progress related to certain initiatives.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Why KPIs matter for your medical practice</h3>\r\n<p>Improving the patient experience and level of care and increasing profit margins are just two of numerous reasons to establish key performance indicators for your practice. Among those include motivating team members by giving them measurable goals to work toward, identifying areas for improvement and ways your practice can be more competitive, evaluating employee performance, and identifying minor issues in your practice before they become bigger and costlier ones.</p>\r\n<h2>Medical practice KPIs to keep a pulse on</h2>\r\n<p>A strong medical practice KPI is quantifiable, clearly defined, thoroughly communicated, and crucial to helping you achieve your overall objectives. While you may be able to come up with dozens of KPIs across various touchpoints of your practice, we have defined several across three key areas.</p>\r\n<h3>Operations</h3>\r\n<p>From patient wait time to staff to patient ratio to patient-doctor communication, there are several areas of operations to which you should pay attention to both increase patient retention and encourage patient referrals. The top five are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Patient Wait Time: </strong>Keep track of the average amount of time patients wait to see a provider after checking in. Help staff with scheduling to reduce this average as much as possible.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Staff-to-Patient Ratio: </strong>Pay attention to your team’s ability to deliver quality care given the number of patients to be seen at any given time and the resources on hand.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Patient Rooms in Use: </strong>Think of this as your practice’s occupancy rate, and determine if you need more space to accommodate your growing practice.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Room Turnover Rate: </strong>This plays a huge role in patient satisfaction, as it demonstrates how quickly patients move in and out of your facility.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Communication: </strong>Assess whether more or less communication between your practice and patients is desired.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Care</h3>\r\n<p>As a health care provider, your number-one objective should be to deliver top-notch care to your patients. To determine if you routinely meet patients’ expectations or if you have your work cut out for you, refer to two main KPIs.</p>\r\n<p>The first is medication errors. Keep track of the number of times you or a staff member makes a medication error. Medication errors can include anything from prescribing the wrong dose to writing a prescription for the wrong patient to using a pharmacy that routinely messes up.</p>\r\n<p>The second KPI is patient follow-up. Pay attention to the number of patients who receive follow-up care after their initial appointments. Follow-up care can be provided by you, a nurse, or a hygienist, and can be as simple as a receptionist reaching out to a patient to inquiry about how he or she is feeling.</p>\r\n<h3>Finances</h3>\r\n<p>Yes, your main objective is to provide the best possible care to your patients, but the truth is that your practice is still a business. If you let the business side of it slide, you will not be able to fulfill your first goal. To determine how your practice is faring financially and to identify weak areas, there are a few KPIs to keep an eye on.</p>\r\n<p>Cost per visit is important. Every time a patient enters your office, it costs your practice money. If you spend more money to see patients than you make, it may be time to reevaluate your fee schedules, cost of supplies, cost of personnel, or all three.</p>\r\n<p>No-shows and canceled appointments cost you, but do you know how much? According to the data, <a href=\"https://www.kareo.com/blog/article/best-practices-use-key-performance-indicators-manage-your-medical-billing-and-practice/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.kareo.com/blog/article/best-practices-use-key-performance-indicators-manage-your-medical-billing-and-practice/\">no-shows cost, on average, $150,000 per physician per year</a>. Assess your no-show rate and devise ways to reduce it, such as sending out automated reminders.</p>\r\n<p>Claim denials and delayed payments cost your practice money. If your denial rate is greater than 5%, it may be time to sit down with your billing department to figure out why denials are occurring and <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/\">what you can do to prevent them in the future</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, there are several other areas to which you can refer to assess your practice’s performance, but the above are a good start.</p>\r\n<h2>How to establish KPIs for your practice</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand that you have a lot on your plate running your practice without throwing in the need to dissect every single aspect of it.

You can significantly improve the cash flow of your practice and even reduce it to a zero balance. There are several ways to reduce the monthly accounts receivable balance without sacrificing the patient and practice relationship. Here are some simple practice management tips that you can use to impact your incoming revenue significantly.</p>\r\n<h2>Establish Clear Patient Expectations</h2>\r\n<p>NextLevel Practice believes the way a practice <a href=\"https://nextlevelpractice.com/blog/what-is-your-money-mindset/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://nextlevelpractice.com/blog/what-is-your-money-mindset/\">handles cash flow</a> can make or break it. Inform patients about payments and insurance before treatment. Doing this can result in receiving payment upfront or in a more timely manner.</p>\r\n<h3>Verify Insurance Before Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Patients often wrongly assume how much their insurance will cover their treatment. This assumption can cause practices to wait longer to receive a payment if the patient cannot make the difference upfront. Verify patient eligibility and coverage before treatment. Doing this informs the patient about how much they owe and allows them to prepare their payment. <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-listing-qualifying-insurances/\">List accepted insurance plans online</a> so that patients can also verify that their current plan is compatible.</p>\r\n<h3>Try to Collect Payment at the Time of Service</h3>\r\n<p>Although one should not expect every patient to pay off their balance in full, it is beneficial to try and ask every patient when they come to the office. Be prepared for patients that ask for options to spread their payment out. Walk them through the process of paying their balance and be specific about how to make payments. Process statements as quickly as possible as the longer it takes for patients to get a bill, the less likely the practice will receive payment at all.</p>\r\n<h3>Take Advantage of Technology</h3>\r\n<p>Gone are the days of waiting a month for payment after mailing out a patient&#8217;s statement. Patients can now make payments online in a matter of minutes. Online payment options can shorten wait times by about three weeks. Offering online bill pay is one of the easiest ways to achieve a zero balance office. </p>\r\n<h3>Ensure Appropriate Staffing Levels</h3>\r\n<p>Problems can arise when there are not enough employees to manage the number of patients. Details like checking patient invoices and promptly mailing out statements can be some of the first things to fall through the cracks. Check with team members and ensure that they have enough time and resources to deliver accurate and timely statements and process payments.</p>\r\n<h2>Get the Support You Need</h2>\r\n<p>Practice management is an important part of running a successful practice.

The amount of trust patients have in your practice, as well as what your practice is worth financially, can have a large impact on its health and growth. Taking a closer look at these can improve both your practice and the experience of your patients. </p>\r\n<h2>Different aspects of brand value</h2>\r\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/stories/innovation/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-2020/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/stories/innovation/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands-2020/\">Forbes</a> defines brand value by how much the brand would be worth if it was sold, there is much more that goes into determining that number than just inventory on hand or what is in the bank account. Revenue can sharply increase or decrease based on aspects such as brand authority and brand equity.</p>\r\n<h3>Brand authority</h3>\r\n<p>The level of trust patients have in your practice, as well as the degree to which patients view your practice as providing expert care in your specific field, determines its brand authority. Because this can be very subjective, brand authority can fluctuate quickly. Cure a high-profile patient or master a difficult medical procedure, and your practice will typically earn more brand authority. Cause complications for a well-known patient or get involved in a medical malpractice case and your brand authority will generally plummet. </p>\r\n<h3>Brand equity</h3>\r\n<p>The loyalty of your patients, who your practice is associated with, and how visible your practice is combine to form brand equity. Like brand authority, brand equity can shift quickly because it is subjective. Become associated with a popular medial foundation or heal the mayor, and your practice is likely to get more visibility, thus increasing patient loyalty and, subsequently, brand equity. </p>\r\n<h2>The importance of brand value for patients </h2>\r\n<p>A higher brand value can not only help increase the profitability of your practice, but also assist with improving patient relations. </p>\r\n<h3>Increased patient loyalty</h3>\r\n<p>If the brand authority or brand value of your practice is low, patients tend to be warier about scheduling a procedure and can have negative expectations about their experience. In this case, it is easy for those expectations to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, even if nothing major goes wrong. When brand authority is high, patients are more likely to expect a positive experience at your practice. As long as these expectations are met, you have most likely created a patient for life.</p>\r\n<h3>Faster work in progress times</h3>\r\n<p>Have you ever looked at a stack of unpaid patient statements and wondered what you could do to encourage a faster work in progress time? Building brand authority and value can be part of the solution. Not many patients are rushing to pay the bill from a small, seemingly insignificant practice no one is talking about. However, patients can be more likely to submit payment more quickly for a well-respected practice that is popular in the community. </p>\r\n<h2>Build your brand and your practice</h2>\r\n<p>Building your practice starts with patient acquisition, which our team at Doctor Genius knows all about. Our experience can help you understand and market your brand so that you can increase both brand awareness and your patient roster.
