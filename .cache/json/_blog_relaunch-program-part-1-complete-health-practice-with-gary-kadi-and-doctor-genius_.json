Due to the new situation for many patients in your community, it is crucial to learn how to tap into that market and offer the healthy lifestyle your services can provide. Doctor Genius has partnered with Gary Kadi, CEO of NextLevel Practice, to help clients like yourself face uncertainty while reopening your practice with a focus to adjust for success.</p>\n<h4>Who is Gary Kadi?</h4>\n<p>CEO of NextLevel Practice, Gary Kadi is also an advocate, author, and documentarian. Kadi authored Million Dollar Dentistry, a book that promotes dentists building a healthy practice for healthy patients and healthy lives. Kadi has guided NextLevel Practice to create over 1.6 billion in increased collections, 50,000 more true vacation weeks, and over 6 million healthier patients with practices. Kadi strives to help dentists educate their patients, empower their teams, and improve their finances.</p>\n<h4>What is a Complete Health Practice?</h4>\n<p>Complete Health Dentistry is a philosophy that focuses on maintaining good oral health in order to improve your overall general health. When you see your Complete Health Dentist for one of your preventive dental checkups, you’re not only taking care of your mouth but also your body. They will not only clean your teeth but also check for the early warning signs of both periodontal disease, oral cancer, and more. You’d be surprised what your mouth can tell you about the health of your entire body!</p>\n<p>With this in mind, a practice that believes in and practices Complete Health Dentistry integrates all areas of dental medicine in order to bring harmony to the mouth and body. Complete Health Dentistry Services Include: </p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A clean and attractive smile</li>\n\t<li>Cavity detection and treatment</li>\n\t<li>Gum disease therapy to stop the spread of this bacterial infection</li>\n\t<li>Oral cancer screening</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How is Complete Health Dentistry Becoming the New Normal?</h4>\n<p>As Gary Kadi explains, there are four main areas of the new normal in dentistry, including:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Less time for traditional dentistry methods</li>\n\t<li>Increased expenses</li>\n\t<li>Patient scarcity</li>\n\t<li>A new focus on selling health on a website</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What is the purpose of the Complete Health Practice Plan?</h4>\n<p>The purpose of the Complete Health Practice Plan is to provide our clients with the framework for a thriving practice in a new world. Our framework is an extension to Gary Kadi’s NextLevel Practice coaching products and programs, who work to create a “Healthy Practice” to make patients healthier. The Practice Plan’s end goal is to improve the health of the patient, team, and practice by conveying the connection between oral health and overall health. The Complete Health Practice brings to light the areas of the body and conditions most prominently related to untreated oral health.</p>\n<p>This process involves reviewing the patient’s medical history for signs of issues such as diabetes, inflammation, or high blood pressure that can correlate to the treatment and prevention of oral health issues. The patient’s experience from the initial call to the discussion of treatment plans will be focused on their overall health through achieving a healthy mouth. </p>\n<p>The content and messaging of a dentist’s website are valuable because you are educating patients about the practice, what the goal of the practice is, and the reason the patient needs it. Our clients can help build a positive relationship with patients for regular checkups in the future. We will ensure that patients receive your message about Complete Health Dentistry through your website and online marketing.</p>\n<h2>Selling Health Through Educating Content</h2>\n<p>Patients are becoming better informed about dental care as our culture continues to increase its emphasis on the importance of a healthy lifestyle. With educating content, dentists can help patients understand the importance of proper dental care and how to receive it.</p>\n<h4>How can educating content help increase the flow of patients?</h4>\n<p>Our premium plans feature additional services that allow for customized content such as website copy, dental service pages, blogs, etc. We can develop content that sends the right message for what your practice is all about, combining SEO value to help increase your rankings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">Click here to learn more about educating content and how it can help you.</a></p>\n<h4>How can you help my website rank?</h4>\n<p>While helping a website to remain active, Doctor Genius continues to monitor and stay up to date on <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">Google’s algorithm updates</a>. When Google changes the way their search algorithm operates, there is a chance that a website’s position on a search results list will fluctuate. Even though this can work in favor of certain fields (medical, entertainment, news, etc.), other websites can face lower ranking. Many feel the effects of a core update may seemingly be unpredictable. However, our team tracks industry experts and corporate publications to follow the breadcrumbs that reveal where Google will likely shift focus on what content ranking is more important. </p>\n<h2>Reach Out to Us and Re-Invent Your Practice for Success</h2>\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about the Complete Health Practice and how Gary Kadi can help you formulate a plan of action visit, <a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram\">https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram</a>.

It takes a new approach that focuses on improving the patient&#8217;s experience and view of oral care. Gary Kadi, from Next Level Practice, has the plan to relaunch practices and help them make the changes they need to take their practice to the next level. To achieve this, we can help review every aspect of your practice and find the key areas for improvement.</p>\r\n<p>The next question many people are asking is, &#8220;how to transition into a complete health practice?&#8221; This is where the relaunch program helps.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the Relaunch Program?</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram\">The Relaunch Program</a> is a one-month step-by-step coaching program with one of our NextLevel expert coaches. The coach will work with the client, providing a concrete written plan. This plan will help inspire your team to provide:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Outstanding patient care</li>\r\n\t<li>Increase productivity</li>\r\n\t<li>Optimize profitability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This program helps promote <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/relaunch-program-part-1-complete-health-practice-with-gary-kadi-and-doctor-genius/\">complete health dentistry,</a> which involves an entirely new approach to dental care. Instead of only viewing a patient&#8217;s oral health, dentists consider how one&#8217;s oral health affects the rest of the body before customizing a new treatment for a healthier lifestyle. This program features three one-hour sessions with your very own coach, who will work with you one-on-one. This will allow your advisor to build a strong report, as they continue to provide solutions uniquely tailored to your brand. </p>\r\n<h2>How Many Sessions are in the Relaunch Program?</h2>\r\n<p>The Relaunch program is in three main sessions, Launchpad, Trajectory, and Launch Plan. Each session&#8217;s goal is to help lay the foundation for your unique relaunch plan and map out the process step by step.</p>\r\n<h3>Session 1: Launchpad</h3>\r\n<p>During the first session, the coach will help define your goals for your practice and career. After all, the only way to truly enhance your practice is to flesh out your ideal vision. This session is the first step to relaunching your practice in a new direction.</p>\r\n<h3>Session 2: Trajectory</h3>\r\n<p>During the second session, the coach will go over your practice&#8217;s history, available services, profitability, and more. This session&#8217;s goal is to take a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of the practice and create a clear picture of the areas of opportunity for growth. The coach can also help find the areas that will need the most change, helping you boost the efficiency of your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Session 3: Launch Plan</h3>\r\n<p>The last session involves developing a clear plan for your practice from where it is now, to where you want it to be. While the steps remain the same, each plan is customized to the individual client&#8217;s practice. Thus, you will be able to develop the ideas for your practice and achieve substantial results. We will help guide your practice in the direction it needs to go while working within the plan.</p>\r\n<h2>Take Your Practice to the Next Level</h2>\r\n<p>Under the direction of Gary Kadi, NextLevel Practice offers multiple options that include the Relaunch Program.

Above all else, it informs potential customers and clients of the products and services you offer. An integral part of a business page is the blog. These posts should contain relevant content and utilize terms to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/preparedness-the-importance-of-seo-during-covid-19/\">increase SEO optimization</a> and E-A-T rankings among search engines that direct traffic to the site. Older blog posts may seem to do nothing but take up space; however, even outdated, keeping them may prove beneficial. Learn why your old content is still essential and what you can do to keep it relevant.</p>\r\n<h2>What purpose do old blog posts serve?</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertadams/2017/04/10/23-proven-ways-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website/#3ddda45e2654\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertadams/2017/04/10/23-proven-ways-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website/#3ddda45e2654\">Forbes</a>, company blogs are a way to reach a broader audience by posting information and articles relevant to the business. The more traffic posts get, the higher the site is ranked in search engine analytics, which boosts it in results. When people visit a business site, they like to see an established platform and history. A blog with a higher number of relevant and appropriate posts also lends credence to the business&#8217;s credibility. Thus, deleting older posts may not only detract from that but also inadvertently remove articles that continue to perform well.</p>\r\n<h2>How can you make old content relevant?</h2>\r\n<p>If a search of your blog brings up poor writing or posts that no longer apply, then you may consider deleting them. However, instead of doing that, and risking a decrease in traffic or credibility, there are things you can do to make them relevant again.</p>\r\n<h3>Use links</h3>\r\n<p>You already know that consistently creating new content helps site visitors to see that you are engaging and relevant. Make older posts productive again by linking them in your newer posts. If a former piece has stood the test of time and is accurate, relevant, and well-written, repost it. There is nothing wrong with recycling material to continue benefiting your business. You may also want to drop blog links in other content on your site. Doing so may garner more views for older posts.</p>\r\n<h3>Update content</h3>\r\n<p>Your older blogs may have some outdated information. There is nothing wrong with correcting things that are now irrelevant or incorrect. Fix company contact information if that has changed, but do it without deleting the old. If former customers search your previous address or phone number, you still want the traffic directed to your page. Also, leave relevant SEO terms in place as much as possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Promote your business wisely</h2>\r\n<p>The purpose of a company website is to capture potential clients. At Doctor Genius, we understand how to construct blog posts and flow to garner your business the most traffic.
