However, with 330 million users, 69 million of which are in the United State according to a study by <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/242606/number-of-active-twitter-users-in-selected-countries/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/242606/number-of-active-twitter-users-in-selected-countries/\">statista.com</a>, failing to use Twitter for medical content marketing is a big misstep. Twitter is ideal for reaching new patients, promoting information about your practice, and driving more traffic to your website.  </p>\r\n<h2>Tips for tweets</h2>\r\n<p>That said, tweeting out links to new blog posts on your website is not enough to bring in new traffic. Like all social media platforms, certain marketing strategies work better than others on this media giant. Here are five tips to get the most out of a business Twitter account.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Promote links directly in a tweet</h3>\r\n<p>Encouraging more Twitter users to explore your website begins by providing links to content in short tweets. Tweets that are concise and intriguing are more likely to attract interest than longer ones. Consider writing tweets that are less than 100 characters (though Twitter allows up to 280). Present a question, write a call to action, or include an engaging quote from the content you are promoting that makes users want to click on the link.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Place a link in your bio</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to tweets, you can include a link to a website in your Twitter bio. The bio appears at the top of your profile page, offering a quick opportunity to present who you are to new patients. Many businesses take advantage of the bio by pitching services and interests. In this area, you may also include a link to anywhere on your website. If you have an official landing page specifically for new patients, the bio is a great place to drop a link to it.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Include hashtags</h3>\r\n<p>Hashtags are a fantastic way to generate interest in your content and connect with other users who share similar interests. In short, hashtags are specific words or key phrases that are placed after a # within a tweet. To attract the right audience and establish <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/\">strong SEO</a>, either create special hashtags that apply to your practice or include hashtags that others are already using to link your content to a larger conversation.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Try facts and statistics</h3>\r\n<p>Of the most engaging content on Twitter, facts, studies, and statistics top the list. Including a sneak peek at a new study or mentioning an interesting fact in a tweet is a great way to get someone to click on a link.</p>\r\n<h3>5. Use plenty of pictures</h3>\r\n<p>To catch the attention of users who quickly scan through their Twitter feed, try including interesting pictures that are relevant to your content. Pictures can make users pause as they scroll. This increases the chance that they will engage with the tweet by reading the content and clicking on links.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more ways to engage with new patients</h2>\r\n<p>Discover more ways to reach new patients and expand your practice through Doctor Genius. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> for help optimizing your Twitter and your other social media platforms and promoting business.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 16800 Aston Street, Suite 270, Irvine, CA 92606, provides a range of services for practice success.

It is a way to be more regularly active<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/should-you-cross-post-on-social-media-to-promote-a-medical-practice/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Cross-posting can be enticing when you are building your medical practice. It is a way to be more regularly active on your social media platforms without exerting extra effort, saving you valuable time. However, because most social media sites run on different formats with different goals, cross-posting is not always a sound strategy. Posting an identical message on both Facebook and Twitter can have negative effects on your medical content marketing; such duplication simply does not work in today’s buzzing world of social media.</p>\r\n<h2>When to cross-post</h2>\r\n<p>Marketing over social media for doctors is no different than marketing for any other business. You need to take the time to determine how each media platform’s audience scans and digests information and how to optimize your posts so they reach the most people. Understanding how to effectively cross-post between platforms is as essential as knowing when you simply need new content among your accounts.</p>\r\n<h3>The harm of posting identical content</h3>\r\n<p>Every social media platform provides a different experience for users and usually caters to different audiences. For example, statista.com reports that males between the ages of 25 and 34 make up the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/\">largest demographic on Facebook</a>, but users above the age of 40 are the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/246172/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-linkedin-by-age-group/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20third%20quarter,25%20years%20did%20the%20same.\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/246172/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-linkedin-by-age-group/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20third%20quarter,25%20years%20did%20the%20same.\">largest group on LinkedIn</a>. A message posted on Facebook aimed at younger users is not going to have the same impact with users on LinkedIn, and the same goes for Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest. In fact, slapping identical content across all of your accounts can lose current patients instead of gaining more.</p>\r\n<h3>The benefit of cross-promoting</h3>\r\n<p>Though cross-posting can negatively impact your image on social media, you can still promote identical content from your website — you only need to change how the information is presented across the platforms. Every time you have a new blog post or new page you want to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\">share with patients</a> and online followers, create a separate promotion for each media account that fits the audience and format. To post on Twitter, make sure your message is concise and under 280 characters. On Instagram, include a high-quality image and a fun or insightful story to go with it. Changing up similar content can lead more users back to your website from every social site.</p>\r\n<h2>How to effectively cross-promote</h2>\r\n<p>When you are ready to promote new content, sit down and write a brief summary (a few sentences should do) of what you want current and potential patients to know about the content. Then incorporate that summary into a different post for each platform, making sure to abide by character limits, audience constraints, and general guidelines. If you find that one type of post works particularly well on a certain site, continue using it as a template for future posts on that site. Once you get a feel for what posts work better on each site, writing promotions becomes much easier and takes less time.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover effective ways to promote on social media</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can work with you to create effective promotions and posts that engage your audience and reach more patients. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact us</a> to discover the latest trends in social media marketing.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 16800 Aston Street, Suite 270, Irvine, CA 92606, provides a range of services for practice success.
