Practices across the country have reduced the hours or shut their doors completely, leaving providers wondering what to do when the pandemic is over. What steps need to be taken to jump back in and see patients again? While it might seem impossible to hit the ground running, you can do just that with a little preparation.</p>\r\n<h2>Steps to keep schedules full after the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>It could take months or even a year before life is back to normal. When that happens, patients will be ready to go to local practices. Practices that take the steps necessary to get up and to run quickly will enjoy an influx of patients. Many will even have stronger practices than ever before.</p>\r\n<h3>Get financial help</h3>\r\n<p>While some practices are closed, others are still open but offer fewer services. In both cases, practices have fewer financial resources available. It is hard to get up and running without any capital, so practices are encouraged to use the available financial resources to put cash into the business. The federal government is currently offering a Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, including medical and dental practices, keep employees on the payroll. Keeping employees on the payroll will make it easier to run on all cylinders when the pandemic is over.</p>\r\n<p>The federal government is offering other financial options for practices that have taken a financial hit during the COVID-19 pandemic. These options include loan advances, bridge loans, and debt relief. Practices can use these resources to stay financially healthy during the pandemic. Then, when the pandemic is under control, practices will be ready to get back to work.</p>\r\n<h3>Expand hours when reopening</h3>\r\n<p>There will be a massive demand for health care providers and dentists when Americans are no longer required to engage in social distancing. Practices are encouraged to expand their hours to meet the demand. Those who do this are more likely to get a larger portion of the patients. If possible, practices should also consider working on weekends until the demand begins to die down. This can help practices generate revenue in the first several months after the pandemic ends.</p>\r\n<h3>Broadcast sterilization techniques</h3>\r\n<p>The aftermath of the pandemic will likely include psychological changes. Americans will be more fearful of germs and viruses. Practices that want to attract patients will need to make sterilization strategies part of their business models. Simply cleaning more often is not enough. Practices need to communicate what they are doing to the patients. Those who go the extra mile are more likely to generate business.</p>\r\n<h2>Get ready to restart your practice</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has changed the way you do business. It might seem like there is no end in sight, but eventually, the pandemic will be contained, and you will go back to business as normal. For that to happen, however, you need to take steps to prepare. Get the financial help you need during the pandemic. Then, consider expanding your hours and adopt sterilization techniques so your patients will not worry about getting sick. Then, you can treat patients like you did before COVID-19 took over.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

You understand the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve. Still, you worry about finances. You need a full schedule to generate revenue, so rescheduling your appointments is critical. Here are a few rescheduling tips to help your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Tips for rescheduling appointments during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Communication is key to filling waiting rooms once the crisis is over. Health care providers know that shelter-in-place orders could continue for months. Some even expect it could last until 2021 when a possible vaccine may finally be ready. Providers should connect with patients, so they understand what to expect during this time.</p>\r\n<p>Also, this call will help ensure patients return for the rescheduled appointment. The provider can answer any questions patients may have.</p>\r\n<h3>Prioritize based on the needs of the patients</h3>\r\n<p>Health care providers should prioritize patients when rescheduling appointments. Patients who are at the highest risk should get priority when rescheduling. Providers should stay in frequent contact with these patients, providing updates on when it will be possible to see them again. Maintaining contact shows the patients that their health is a priority for the practice. This provides an incentive to reschedule.</p>\r\n<h3>Make rescheduling easy</h3>\r\n<p>Even before COVID-19, most patients prefer scheduling appointments online. Practices can expect to see a spike in rescheduled appointments with online scheduling. The fear of the unknown makes it difficult for patients to know when it is okay to go to a provider. By providing online scheduling, patients can fill those slots when they feel comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>This also lessens the burden on the staff. Staff members are already bogged down with phone calls. Allowing patients to reschedule online allows members to talk to those who need it most. This takes the stress off the staff members’ shoulders. It also makes it easier to keep a full schedule. Patients, employees, and business owners win with this strategy.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider telehealth</h3>\r\n<p>Telehealth and teledentistry have come into vogue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology allows providers to manage basic conditions and offer preventative care. These appointments tend to take less time for both the patient and the provider and are more affordable. They can also take place over the computer or phone. This form of appointment limits in-person visits.</p>\r\n<p>If possible, providers should rely on telehealth to manage some of the burdens. Filling the schedule with telehealth appointments makes it easier to meet the demands of the patients. Providers who use this can begin seeing patients now. These providers do not have to wait until the crisis is over. Also, providers can maintain appointments with telehealth even after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep the books full during and after the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>\r\n<p>It is normal to feel worried about the state of your practice during a pandemic. Canceled appointments hurt your bottom line. You need to reschedule those missed opportunities. Fortunately, you can fill your schedule. Communicate with your patients, give priority to those who are at the highest risk, and make it easy for people to reschedule. Also, you can rely on telehealth so you can catch up on rescheduled appointments quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

While this concept works in all areas of business and personal growth, many medical and dental practices have particularly enjoyed success using Kaizen. The key is to implement strategies that inspire teams. When everyone is inspired and involved, those small improvements add up and create a healthy practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Kaizen strategies to inspire teams</h2>\r\n<p>Employees should be at the heart of a practice’s Kaizen strategy. This goes beyond the top of the chain employees. Everyone, including janitors and support staff, is needed for this strategy to work. Once everyone is involved, employees will feel inspired. To ensure inspiration, employers must train employees, empower them, and measure the results.</p>\r\n<h3>Train employees on Kaizen</h3>\r\n<p>Before a practice can implement Kaizen strategies, it must ensure that employees fully understand it. All employees must receive training on Kaizen. The strategies are simple and include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Improvements with small, incremental changes</li>\r\n\t<li>The ideas come from the employees</li>\r\n\t<li>Feedback for all changes</li>\r\n\t<li>The results are measurable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Practices should train all current employees. Also, new employees should be trained on Kaizen when hired. Once everyone is on the same page, it is time to implement the strategies. Then, the practice can make small improvements and inspire employees.</p>\r\n<h3>Empower employees and teams</h3>\r\n<p>To truly inspire, practices must empower employees. All employees should be encouraged to share ideas to improve their positions. Employees give suggestions to supervisors, who then empower them to implement the change immediately. This gives employees the freedom to make meaningful changes in the workplace.</p>\r\n<p>Practices should also encourage teams to work together to brainstorm ideas for changes. When working in teams, it is common to have several solutions. The team should select one of the ideas and start with it. Then, if that idea does not provide the desired results, the team can try a different idea.</p>\r\n<h3>Measure the results</h3>\r\n<p>Kaizen works because it is measurable. Supervisors must measure the outcome after the changes are implemented. After the results are tracked, the employee meets with the supervisor to go over the results. If both agree that the results showed a positive outcome, the new practice can be standardized and enforced. It will continue to be the standard mode of practice until someone else comes up with a new way to improve the results.</p>\r\n<p>Employees cannot help but feel inspired after their ideas become standard practice. These employees are making a difference on the practice. That causes employees to work hard to come up with additional ideas as well. It is exciting to have a role in changing a practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Grow your practice with Kaizen</h2>\r\n<p>Significant changes are challenging to implement and often do not provide the results you need for your practice. With Kaizen, you can use small changes to transform your practice. You might not notice huge changes overnight, but after using Kaizen for a few months, you will start to see significant results. Possibly, more importantly, your employees will be inspired and take ownership of their positions. Use these tips to implement strategies that get your employees excited to contribute at work.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
