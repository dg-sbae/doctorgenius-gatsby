The only issue is that you do not have the time to focus on click-through rate. Fortunately, Doctor Genius will not only help maintain a presence, but can also utilize tools to enhance the click-through and conversion rate. People may not realize that click-through rate is for ads where conversion rate measures website traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>More than just an ad</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An ad for one’s practice is not nearly as simple as just stating the name and a service. Professional practices need to use the right words, structure and presentation to increase the chance of click-through rates. While these factors are important to helping potential patients click on an ad or landing page to go to the official website, there is a learning curve to effectively increasing the click through rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To clarify, click-through rate is the measure of the number of people who view a piece of content with the “Click here to read more” button and follow through on the action. Hootsuite.com explains, “If 100 people saw your ad in Google and one person clicked on the ad, you would have a click-through-rate of 1.0 percent.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the methods for increasing a click-through rate differ for various fields of business, there may not be a single method for increasing the rate. Fortunately, Doctor Genius has the knowledge and skills to improve a website’s click-through rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Website Structure</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-12-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-862\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-12-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-12-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-12-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">In 2016, Ascend2 found that 54 percent of marketers say increasing the engagement rate is their top email marketing priority.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to click-through rate, conversion rate is the measure of website visitors who follow through on an action within the page of the website. The difference being that the individual is already on the website. However, the website needs to have an easy-to-navigate structure so people want to stay on the website and can find the information they need. Smartphones are becoming the popular choice for people searching through websites on the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, Google found that 65 percent of smartphone users look for the most relevant information through a Google Search on their smartphone without much emphasis on the company providing the information. Smartphones are a universal tool that can complete both an Internet search and Facebook post at the same time. Thus, having a website structure that works on both desktop computers and phones will greatly benefit the practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we develop a mobile-first website that displays properly on smartphones and other devices. We also focus on achieving high conversion and click-through rates for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

Websites continue to try and keep up, only to find that there are multiple rules, regulations, and laws that seem to change constantly. Due to this, professionals in a variety of fields strive to keep up with the changes and help their website rank. With all of the challenges these changes present, Doctor Genius can help clients keep up with these changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What you need to know</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is beneficial for professionals to reach potential patients, clients or customers outside of the professionals’ local area, it is crucial to tap into the local market. While creating and maintaining a website is a crucial step, it is only the beginning. In order to rank, Google will scan a website for multiple factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Sitemap</li>\r\n \t<li>Keywords on the website that match popular search results</li>\r\n \t<li>The page title and meta description</li>\r\n \t<li>Inbound links</li>\r\n \t<li>Quantity and quality of words</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>By gaining notoriety and business with locals, professionals can create a solid source of profit with locals who will return in the future. Google is trying to provide a realistic experience for local users with information based on the exact time and location of the user. Thus, ranking in local search results is an important factor leading to one’s success. In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers who conducted local searches visited a store within five miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Joy Hawkins writes in an article on SearchEngineLand.com, “Google actively filters out listings from the local results that are similar to other listings that rank already,” adding that “Google picks the most relevant listing of the bunch and filters the rest.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This algorithm can actually help some businesses rank better on local search results, especially when there are other professionals offering similar services in the same profession. While Google will not go into the specifics of their updates, Doctor Genius can follow these updates and adjust accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius has the knowledge and expertise</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-909\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-sept-19-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\"> In 2016, WordStream found that 72 percent of consumers who conducted local searches visited a store within five miles.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The team at Doctor Genius has the knowledge and expertise to help patients rank on local search results.

In many cases, parents will have to push back dental checkups for their children or even cancel with no new appointment in sight. Another issue is reaching a greater base of potential patients through the proper channels. Fortunately, Doctor Genius offers the services to help with reaching potential patients.\r\n\r\n<h3>Consistent Content Rate</h3>\r\nKeeping a consistent rate of high-quality content on a website will help to keep the website active. Thus, Google will see that the website has new content on a regular basis and place it higher on a list of search results. When someone searches for “dentists near me,” Google will place active websites first over websites that do not have new content on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n<h3>Social Media Management</h3>\r\nAlong with consistently uploading new content to a website, clients also need to continue posting on social media platforms. Regular posts will help to appear on follower’s feeds, which in turn will allow other friends of those followers to see the posts. The posts can also lead back to the website and increase more new patients.\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">We can provide you with quality content and professional support to keep your website running effectively and smoothly.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-Sept-5-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-705\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-Sept-5-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-Sept-5-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/study-Sept-5-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Call Tracking System</h3>\r\nA call tracking system allows for professionals to monitor how many calls they receive from new patients or current patients. At Doctor Genius, we use this system to measure how many new patients a client has each month and determine the best method for bringing in more new patients.\r\n\r\n<h3>Mobile First Website</h3>\r\nA mobile first website will respond to whatever device an individual is using and reorganize the site to match that screen. This way, if the individual is viewing the website on a smartphone, then it will appear to fit that screen correctly. This is crucial as smartphones are a common and essential technology of today.\r\n\r\n<h3>Service Pages with Keywords</h3>\r\nWe also provide clients with service pages that pertain to their area of medicine and services they offer. We create the custom content for these pages and ensure there is a proper amount of keywords to help the page rank higher in Google search results. During the process of creating a website for you, our Support Team will go over keywords that rank and pertain to your services.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
