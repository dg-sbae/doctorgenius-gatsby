It differs from traditional SEO in that you do not optimize your website for these key terms but rather optimize the authoritative site for them. Here is why you would want to do this.</p>\r\n<h2>The Concept Behind Barnacle SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Barnacle SEO is a term to describe a relationship similar to one that occurs in the natural world. In nature, barnacles will attach themselves to a moving object, such as a whale, so that they may drift along with the whale through the current and catch whatever nutrients come by. In turn, the barnacles provide the whale with something akin to a suit of armor. This concept works the same regarding big and small websites.</p>\r\n<h3>Using Other Sites To Improving Ranking</h3>\r\n<p>On its own, a small website has little to no chance of ranking for the industry’s most competitive key terms. It would be a significant drain on one&#8217;s resources to try to. Fortunately, sites are available that easily rank for those keywords that one can attach their brand’s name to benefit from their authority. Two of the biggest “whales,” so to speak, are Google and Yelp. However, there are other useful sites to which a brand can attach their name to. Some of these sites can serve a practice better than Google or Yelp. For instance, health practitioners may also want to <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/using-doctor-ratings-sites#1\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/using-doctor-ratings-sites#1\">look into niche sites</a> like Vitals and Healthgrades.</p>\r\n<h3>A Google Business Profile</h3>\r\n<p>A Google Business Profile is vital for SEO since it helps gain search engine visibility and gives businesses a better chance of appearing in local Google Search results and Google Maps. A Google My Business account allows one to claim ownership of their Business Profile and make changes to it. Making changes and updating information to ensure it is accurate creates an optimized profile that helps it rank for local and competitive keywords.</p>\r\n<h3>Yelp Matters</h3>\r\n<p>As the largest local review site next to Google+ Local, Yelp matters a lot. Yelp pages often show up at the top of Google for even generic terms like doctor, dentist, and chiropractor. Yelp results also feature ratings, which heavily influence conversions. The site also influences Google and Bing behind the scenes, meaning that a strong Yelp profile with many reviews can cause either of the search engines to show a profile before others.</p>\r\n<h2>Supporting Your Barnacle SEO Efforts</h2>\r\n<p>Google and Yelp<a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\"> can support your barnacle SEO efforts</a> in unique ways.

Your practice must stand out on the internet to do well in a competitive industry. Establishing trust with your audience is a great way to stand out from the competition. One way to build this trust is by including your affiliation with an organization. This information provides trust signals that can contribute to more page views and clients.</p>\r\n<h2>The Benefits of Listing Professional Affiliations</h2>\r\n<p>It is important to list the professional organizations a company is affiliated with when creating a webpage for a practice. Listing this information can improve conversion numbers by showcasing professionalism and providing examples of personal endeavors. Doing this will help establish audience trust and help boost website search results. It is easy to create content that speaks to one&#8217;s affiliations.</p>\r\n<h3>Website SEO Content</h3>\r\n<p>A website is the first impression many potential clients have of a practice. It should provide responsible and engaging content that relates relevant information to the audience without being overwhelming. While it is effective to list professional affiliations in the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section of the website, it is also beneficial to incorporate them in <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/posting-blogs-regularly/\">regular blog posts</a> to boost SEO-driven hits.</p>\r\n<h3>Approval and Endorsement From a Professional Organization</h3>\r\n<p>Many people start searches with a query about fixing a problem. Creating blogs about the services a practice offers to solve those problems can help with ranking. One can easily integrate an organizational affiliation into those blogs by highlighting any organization-approved methods or products used in treatments or services. Creating blog posts about industry news and the organizations relevant to it can also help raise one&#8217;s profile. The website can also include any practice-specific news. For example, if the <a href=\"https://www.aaoinfo.org/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.aaoinfo.org/\">American Association of Orthodontists</a> endorses the office, highlighting this membership can increase reliability rating with readers.</p>\r\n<h3>Affiliation With Charitable Organizations</h3>\r\n<p>The practice should also list any affiliations with charitable organizations. Information about volunteering with organizations like Operation Smile or Easterseals can also help practice ranking. Showing how practice members lent their time and skills is another way organizational affiliation can build audience trust. Blog posts about practice involvement in charitable organizations are another excellent way to get more website hits and include affiliate links to the relevant sites.</p>\r\n<h2>We Know SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Listing an affiliation with a professional organization is important for SEO. Including this information on a website can help you build credibility and rank higher in the search results.

There is a good chance that your targeted audience may first interact with your brand on a social media platform before ever encountering your website. Having a strong strategy will allow you to build brand awareness, create good organic posts, and convert qualified leads.</p>\r\n<h2>Setting up Your Social Media Accounts for Success</h2>\r\n<p>Now is a great time to get started if your business does not have any social media accounts yet. Take time to evaluate which platforms may be the most beneficial for your company, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>\r\n<h3>Understand the Different Social Platforms</h3>\r\n<p>Having a general understanding of the various social platforms, the type of content, and the audience they attract can help you set up your accounts effectively. For example, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/\">Instagram statistics</a> show the site is most popular among younger adults aged 18 to 34. On the other hand. LinkedIn&#8217;s primary users are between the ages of 46 and 55 years old.</p>\r\n<h3>Create a Brand Identity</h3>\r\n<p>Your office branding should be consistent everywhere people may interact with it. If your company has designed a logo, this image should appear on your signs, marketing collateral, company website, and social media platforms.</p>\r\n<h3>Identify Your Goals</h3>\r\n<p>Run the numbers to evaluate where your company currently is at versus where you need it to be. If your office is already active on social media, identify which areas you need to improve on and focus on those.  Investing in building brand awareness is important to do before directing your efforts towards lead generation and conversions.</p>\r\n<h3>Balance Paid and Organic Content</h3>\r\n<p>When using social media, businesses have two main tools to reach people and direct them towards a specific action: paid advertisements and organic content. Your office does not have to have a large following to reach your intended audience, as most sites do not post your ads on your account. Using paid ads can help you get page likes and present your brand to people who fit your target demographic.</p>\r\n<p>Organic content includes posts on your page. Keep up on posting and engage with your audience to establish your brand and draw potential patients to your office. When done correctly, this can help boost your website’s SEO ranking by encouraging backlinking to highly shared content and increasing the number of branded searches on search engines from people who interact with your office on social media.</p>\r\n<p>Build Brand Awareness and Boost SEO With Social Media</p>\r\n<p>In today’s digital world, social media is a necessary aspect of a business.
