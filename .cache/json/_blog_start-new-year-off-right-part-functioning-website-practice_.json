Fortunately, the team at Doctor Genius can underscore your skills and expertise with our website framework effectively. We can also help to provide maintenance and ensure that your website is functioning properly. The first step is to ensure we customize the website to your desires.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding an effective structure for your content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to have quality information on a page that breaks down a professional’s practice. However, it is also important to have a website that functions properly in attracting new patients. The call to action, CTA, is one example of a tool that helps draw patients into the service from the website. The other benefit of a CTA is that it can be more than a simple “Call Now” message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People can customize or personalize a CTA to promote specific products and services. At Doctor Genius, we can help do just that by customizing the CTA for patients, depending on the practice. Out of 93,000 CTAs, Hubspot.com states that targeted CTAs convert 42 percent more visitors than untargeted CTAs. Along with the call to action, we can also help to customize the website to your requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1080\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan4-1-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h3>Build your website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we can customize the color, logo and overall style of a website to your needs. By working with our Support Team, you will be able to go over all functions of your website and any potential designs. It is important to note that while you can customize your website, there will be specific tools and structures that we implement for the overall functionality of the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">Hubspot.com found that placing an anchor text CTA on a page, increased the view-to-lead conversion rate of website visitors by 121 percent.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>We can identify the key location for a CTA and the other page content. An example of a smart CTA is to highlight a specific medical service or special on the page with similar content, such as a CTA about investing in dental implants on a dental implants page. Another example is highlighting a CTA with a deal for teeth whitening on a teeth whitening page. We can also provide slider images and text on the homepage based on your services and desires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since setting up an effective website can take some time, do not hesitate to give us a call for more information or to schedule a consultation. Start off the New Year right with a fully functional and customized website today.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

In the beginning, things seem to work out and the website attracts more patients. Over time, less and less new patients contact the practice. Looking online, the professional finds that the website is broken on certain pages and does not appear in the first few pages of most Google searches. This professional needs a company like Doctor Genius to provide constant maintenance for any issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Constant maintenance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for a website to run smoothly, there needs to be constant maintenance from a skilled professional. At Doctor Genius, we have a team of professionals who can provide the necessary website maintenance to help our clients receive the benefits of a website for their practice. If there is ever an issue with the website, we have professionals available to help fix it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also continue to help monitor other mechanisms within the website and ensure that they are running properly. One of the main functions of a website is to bring in new patients. While a website can offer patients a system for scheduling an appointment online, many offer an office phone number for the patient to contact the practice. However, a call tracking system can help keep track of what is working and what is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">According to Invoca, 65 percent of people prefer to contact a business by phone as opposed to the 24 percent who prefer to fill out a form online.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1089\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan9-1-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Call tracking system</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Professionals may not realize that the importance of a call tracking system. A call tracking system can help to analyze all marketing efforts of a website and determine which are the most effective. At Doctor Genius, we can help determine what is bringing in new patients and what is not. We can then change the website for these needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Invoca states that 73 percent of marketers prefer to feature phone numbers in marketing emails if they can effectively track the data. While texting is a more common form of communication in other situations, people want to be able to speak with a professional representative about the available services. At Doctor Genius, we can track if the emails with a phone number are effective or if the social media page is the source of new patients calling in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our call tracking system, other services and website maintenance, we can help you reach new patients in an effective manner while also help with patient retention.

When it comes to reading most forms of text, few people will read it differently. Thus, when people view a webpage, they will read the same way. However, people do not read everything on a webpage and may skim the page, making it crucial to highlight specific details in easy to read places.</p>\r\n<h3>What people want to see</h3>\r\n<p>Reading is becoming less of a social norm than what it used to be. The Pew Research Center finds that in 2015, around 27 percent of U.S. adults did not read a single book within 12 months. The problem is that this lack of reading does not stop at just books, but it continues to any form of reading, including online content.</p>\r\n<p>Most people may skim or click “Accept” without reading the Terms and Conditions of an IOS update, but people may also skim content on a web page. If someone needs information on dental implants, they may only have one question out of hundreds of possible questions. If the individual finds the answer, then he or she is less likely to stay on the specific page and may “bounce,” or move, to another website.</p>\r\n<p>By placing crucial content in specific spots on a page, we can help ensure that the individual sees the most important information about a practice. This is where the “Z-Pattern” can be effective.</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">Brandon Jones states in a blog on envato tuts+, that “The Z-Layout is a great way to start just about any web design project because it addresses the core requirements for any effective site: branding, hierarchy, structure, and call to action.”</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_1069\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1069\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"600\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2-300x206.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec12-blog-img2-177x122.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Understanding the Z Layout; http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-the-z-layout-in-web-design&#8211;webdesign-28</p></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Z-Pattern</h3>\r\n<p>The Z-Pattern is a design that follows the projected route of the eyes when an individual reads, left to right and top to bottom. The pattern starts with the top left of the page to the top right, diagonally down the middle to the bottom left and then to the bottom right. Imagine that the reader makes an imaginary line from the top left to the top right and this line is where a practice needs to include the main components the viewer needs to focus on.</p>\r\n<p>The diagonal line will include the body of content, including bits of information that relate to the main focus. The bottom line will contain the call to action at some point. It is important to note that the Z-Pattern is only useful for pages with less content. For the pages with a large amount of content, we will choose to follow the F-Layout instead.</p>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we know when and how to use these layouts properly and help sell the specifics of the page for you. We can help you customize the website for your practice and maximize the level of access for the information that shows off your practice.
