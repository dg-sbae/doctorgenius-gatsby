Consistency in brand messaging is one of the keys to ensuring that your online presence always communicates your core brand values. Doctor Genius can provide a personalized online presence, packed with fresh and unique content that will help you drive sales and stand out from your competitors.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of brand consistency</h2>\r\n<p>Chances are you have invested a lot of thought, effort, and money into standardizing the way your facilities and employees represent your brand in your practice. It is just as essential to ensure that your online presence consistently reflects your desired brand image. A consistent brand helps you project professionalism and establish authority and authenticity. It avoids confusing clients and builds trust with them while providing your business with internal direction.</p>\r\n<h2>Designing your online presence</h2>\r\n<p>Your online presence needs to consistently reflect your brand values while also attracting visitors and converting those visitors into customers or patients. Doctor Genius can help you with a design strategy that both strengthens your brand and improves your results. </p>\r\n<h3>Emphasize what makes you unique</h3>\r\n<p>To stand out from your competitors, you need to identify <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/328078\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/328078\">what makes your practice unique</a> and make sure your clientele know about it. This is not the time to be humble. Your website and other online communications should tell your patrons exactly what your practice does well and how that benefits them so that they know why they should choose you instead of your competitor. </p>\r\n<h3>Be easy to find</h3>\r\n<p>The best website in the world will not do you much good if no one can find it. As an SEO agency, Doctor Genius can design a high-converting, mobile-friendly website for you that places you high in the search results for your chosen keywords. </p>\r\n<h3>Apply your brand guidelines to your online presence</h3>\r\n<p>With a bit of adaptation, you should be able to apply the same brand guidelines you use in your practice to your online presence. It is important to use the same graphics, logos, and fonts you use in your printed, in-office, and other marketing materials on your website and in your social media and e-mail communications. You want your patients to recognize all of your communications as coming from you instantly. </p>\r\n<h3>Keep your online messaging consistent</h3>\r\n<p>To <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">effectively market your brand online</a>, you need to utilize multiple channels such as e-mail, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others.

The goal of your website should be to provide useful, unique content that answers those questions or fills those needs. </p>\r\n<p>However, it is not enough to merely design a useful website. You must also develop a website that ranks high enough for the right keywords that users can find your website. The credibility of your website plays a vital role in how well your site will rank in search engines. Doctor Genius can help you build the credibility your site needs.</p>\r\n<h2>E-A-T</h2>\r\n<p>E-A-T, which stands for expert, authoritative, and trustworthy, is the <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\">guiding principle</a> behind how Google&#8217;s search quality raters evaluate a site&#8217;s fit for a given keyword search. It also plays a big role in how the automated algorithm ranks sites. The two main determining factors of how much E-A-T your site has are the quality of your site and the quality of the links to your site.</p>\r\n<h3>Site quality</h3>\r\n<p>Building a quality site should be your primary goal. You do not just want to attract visitors. You want those visitors to stay on your site and become customers. Additionally, quality content will help you get quality backlinks. </p>\r\n<p>To demonstrate E-A-T on your site, you should focus on creating unique, useful, updated and accurate content. Your content should be free of grammatical errors, well-written and authoritative. Your site design should appear professional and well-organized.</p>\r\n<p>Fresh, original content ranks much better than stale, copied content. To keep your E-A-T high, you need to post new, original, high-quality content continually. Additionally, you should always base your content on authoritative sources, such as academic journals, and use original sources wherever possible. </p>\r\n<p>Your users should be able to easily find a detailed description of your credentials, name, address, location, contact information and privacy policy. It is important that users be able to quickly ascertain who is producing the content on your site, what their level of expertise is, and that they are a real person or organization who can be contacted easily with questions or concerns. </p>\r\n<h3>Backlink quality</h3>\r\n<p>The Google algorithm relies heavily on quality links from other sites to determine how much E-A-T your site has. Links from popular sites with high E-A-T will improve your site&#8217;s E-A-T much more than links from sites with low traffic or questionable reputations. </p>\r\n<p>Our content marketing team at Doctor Genius can help you identify and secure links from the types of sites that can most help you build E-A-T and improve your search engine rankings. </p>\r\n<h2>How Doctor Genius can help</h2>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can help you design a professional website with all the details you need to convince customers that your site is authoritative and trustworthy.

It takes a new approach that focuses on improving the patient&#8217;s experience and view of oral care. Gary Kadi, from Next Level Practice, has the plan to relaunch practices and help them make the changes they need to take their practice to the next level. To achieve this, we can help review every aspect of your practice and find the key areas for improvement.</p>\r\n<p>The next question many people are asking is, &#8220;how to transition into a complete health practice?&#8221; This is where the relaunch program helps.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the Relaunch Program?</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/relaunchprogram\">The Relaunch Program</a> is a one-month step-by-step coaching program with one of our NextLevel expert coaches. The coach will work with the client, providing a concrete written plan. This plan will help inspire your team to provide:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Outstanding patient care</li>\r\n\t<li>Increase productivity</li>\r\n\t<li>Optimize profitability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This program helps promote <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/relaunch-program-part-1-complete-health-practice-with-gary-kadi-and-doctor-genius/\">complete health dentistry,</a> which involves an entirely new approach to dental care. Instead of only viewing a patient&#8217;s oral health, dentists consider how one&#8217;s oral health affects the rest of the body before customizing a new treatment for a healthier lifestyle. This program features three one-hour sessions with your very own coach, who will work with you one-on-one. This will allow your advisor to build a strong report, as they continue to provide solutions uniquely tailored to your brand. </p>\r\n<h2>How Many Sessions are in the Relaunch Program?</h2>\r\n<p>The Relaunch program is in three main sessions, Launchpad, Trajectory, and Launch Plan. Each session&#8217;s goal is to help lay the foundation for your unique relaunch plan and map out the process step by step.</p>\r\n<h3>Session 1: Launchpad</h3>\r\n<p>During the first session, the coach will help define your goals for your practice and career. After all, the only way to truly enhance your practice is to flesh out your ideal vision. This session is the first step to relaunching your practice in a new direction.</p>\r\n<h3>Session 2: Trajectory</h3>\r\n<p>During the second session, the coach will go over your practice&#8217;s history, available services, profitability, and more. This session&#8217;s goal is to take a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of the practice and create a clear picture of the areas of opportunity for growth. The coach can also help find the areas that will need the most change, helping you boost the efficiency of your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Session 3: Launch Plan</h3>\r\n<p>The last session involves developing a clear plan for your practice from where it is now, to where you want it to be. While the steps remain the same, each plan is customized to the individual client&#8217;s practice. Thus, you will be able to develop the ideas for your practice and achieve substantial results. We will help guide your practice in the direction it needs to go while working within the plan.</p>\r\n<h2>Take Your Practice to the Next Level</h2>\r\n<p>Under the direction of Gary Kadi, NextLevel Practice offers multiple options that include the Relaunch Program.
