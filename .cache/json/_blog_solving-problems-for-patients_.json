From dentistry to chiropractic care, patients need to feel that the treatment they receive at the professional practice is having a positive and long-term effect on their overall condition. At Doctor Genius, we can help review methods for finding effective solutions to treat your patients.\r\n<h3>Finding the best solution is not easy</h3>\r\nWhile the main issue for any patient is always about treating pain, patients also need constant care and a practice they can trust. Patients are cautious to trust a medical practice until the practice proves that it is reliable, effective, honest and a strong source of support. The key factor, regardless of the situation, is support. We can help our Doctor Genius clients provide their patients with the care they need.\r\n\r\nWith various forms to fill out, insurance difficulties, payment options, scheduling conflicts and other factors, the treatment experience can be difficult and complicated for the patient. If the process becomes too complex or confusing, the patient is more likely to seek treatment elsewhere. A good support begins with the first phone call to schedule an appointment. Having a website with all the necessary information and forms the patient needs to fill out will also help ease the process.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the client can fill out the forms before visiting the office or fill them out in the waiting room. Regardless, the patient will have prior knowledge of the forms and what information will be necessary. The earlier the patient has this information, the more time the patient will have to ask any questions or address any concerns.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-334\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/08b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>Provide constant support during and after treatment</h3>\r\nIn order to build a strong relationship with patients and help ensure they return in the future, a practice needs to offer a solid support system during and after treatment. This does not mean that the practice needs to go above and beyond every single day. A solid support system means consistency when needing to answer questions, address concerns, being honest with patients and helping patients understand the treatment.\r\n\r\nDuring an appointment, regardless of the patient being established or new, the medical professional needs to address any concerns of the patient while maintaining a calm atmosphere. When a client comes to a dentist with a toothache, he or she is not only searching for treatment for a toothache, but also for a reliable source of treatment for other dental issues in the future.\r\n\r\nA patient may only need a simple checkup but will want to know that this practice will take his or her concerns to mind. Even if the patient does not need a follow-up procedure after the appointment, the patient will want to know what is next. The professional should go over what the patient needs to do to ensure complete recovery.

For a private practice, having positive reviews from patients can greatly increase the likelihood of new patients seeking treatment from said practice. While patients can leave negative reviews, statistics show that online users will search for businesses online before searching elsewhere. It is also important to note is that without reviews, Google will not rank the website.\r\n<h3>The importance of sharing customer reviews</h3>\r\nIn a survey of 2,000 people from Brightlocal.com, 57 percent of patients searched online for a local business at least more than six times a year, 39 percent searched online at least one time per month and 15 percent searched almost every day. When searching online, patients will also take into account what other customers have to say about the business. While a private practice may be concerned over negative reviews, having no reviews in an online presence will be worse.\r\n\r\nThe same survey finds that in 2014, about 58 percent of consumers searched for restaurants and 38 percent searched online for doctors or dentists in their area. Behind searching for restaurants, medical practices were the next most-searched type of content online. The study also finds that in 2014, around 88 percent of consumers read online reviews to determine the quality of business.\r\n<h5><strong>“around 67 percent of consumers needed to read at least six Benefits of reviews before they feel they can trust the business.”</strong></h5>\r\nPeople use the Internet to find a doctor or dentist in their area that provides that specific level of care that they need. While patients may use referrals from friends or family, patient reviews will also play an important part in deciding on a private practice for treatment. For a private practice, seeking patient reviews to post on the practice’s website is a great way to display positive reviews. If one does not want reviews on the website for their practice, then at least through websites such as Yelp or Google, to give the practice a better presence online.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-340\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/09a-TheStudy-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>How people may respond to those reviews</h3>\r\nWith a strong online presence and a website, a private practice will be able to begin drawing in more customers. On average, Brightlocal.com finds that in 2014, around 67 percent of consumers needed to read at least six Benefits of reviews before they feel they can trust the business. Meanwhile, 85 percent needed to read up to 10 reviews before trusting a business. Thus, having online reviews will help to market the practice and draw in more new patients.\r\n\r\nFor any practice worried about a bad review getting in the way or being a problem for new business, the team at Doctor Genius can help handle that. We can help clients organize their reviews and help them to achieve a better level of recognition online. We can help clients build up their practice online and share the positive reviews they receive. The more positive reviews a private practice displays online, the better chance that more new patients will seek treatment.

The digital marketing landscape for healthcare is not as simple as posting a single comment on Facebook or sharing a special discount on Twitter. Navigating the digital marketing landscape can be more difficult than some might believe. To have success, a healthcare practice or company needs to be able to evolve with a constantly changing market.\r\n<h3>Times, they are a changing</h3>\r\nA strong online presence may not completely ensure a strong flow of patients or consumers, but it can increase the probability of reaching more patients through digital marketing. Business Insider cites a report from Custora that finds that “Organic search results accounted for 21 percent of US e-commerce orders,” in the first quarter of 2016, “representing the highest share of all marketing channels.”\r\n\r\nWhile searching online can produce a large variety of results, professionals can rank higher with the proper online presence. However, an online presence may not stand out among other practices in the digital landscape without other methods of creating a strong digital presence. Here are a few helpful hints to better navigate the digital marketing landscape when it comes to healthcare.\r\n<h3>A strong Call-to-Action</h3>\r\nA private practice needs to have an obvious Call-to-Action or “Why-to-Buy,” on the website. As simple as this might sound, a website that does not have a phone number or efficient forms of communication will lose clients. By having an easy means of communication, a reason that the client should seek the service and patient forms available on the website, the practice will help motivate people to seek their service.\r\n<h3>An easily-readable home page</h3>\r\nThe first page of a website that a potential patient lands on is a crucial factor for the individual remaining on the website or seeking information elsewhere. In many cases, a home page can share a possible deal the practice is currently offering or break down the main service of the company in easy-to-read and understandable forms. The patient needs to be able to understand the content at a quick glance, comprehend it and then decide if it is what he or she needs. The home page needs to direct people to other pages within the website that offer more details on the desired search result.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-320\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/07b-TheStudy-Digital-Marketing-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>An active social media presence</h3>\r\nWhile a social media presence on its own will not drastically increase the number of patients for a practice, it can greatly increase the number of possible patients. In a survey of over 1500 American adults, Pew Research Center finds that “Nearly eight-in-ten online Americans,” around 79 percent, use Facebook over other forms of social media. The same study finds that 24 percent use Twitter, 31 percent use Pinterest, while 32 percent use Instagram. Having a strong social media presence is an incredibly beneficial method for reaching consumers and potential patients. While these are only a few hints, there are plenty more available through our services.\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their private practice or business by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into patients to their practice doorstep.
