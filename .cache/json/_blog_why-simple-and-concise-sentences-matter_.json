Clients rely heavily on reviews and site content when choosing a new provider. Separating your practice from similar ones may come down to content design and website readability. Keeping things such as language and sentence structure simple may not only boost your SEO ranking, but it can also capture more business. Find out how keeping things simple can make all the difference when trying to attract more clients.</p>\r\n<h2>Readers have a short attention span</h2>\r\n<p>The world runs at a quick pace, and building a practice page that caters to this is imperative. With the demands of work and family obligations, readers do not want to spend time conducting extensive research to find a provider. Websites that present information in a concise and precise manner tend to top the list in search results, in part due to the ease with which readers can get the information they want. The quicker visitors find what is needed from your site, the more likely they are to return or, better yet, make an appointment. Simplifying website content to make it user-friendly may result in more conversions than you might think.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing tools that simplify content</h2>\r\n<p>A website has only a few seconds to grab a potential client&#8217;s attention and keep them on the page. One way to do this is by creating content that is user friendly, eye-catching, and relevant. Using a more simplistic writing style is beneficial as it tends to reach a wider audience and keep them engaged longer.</p>\r\n<h3>Short sentences</h3>\r\n<p>For a medical practice, you may believe that using an elevated vocabulary and complex sentence structure makes you sound like more of an expert. However, these things lead to fewer conversions because visitors cannot get the message fast enough. Long sentences can prove hard to follow and process. When readers need to read something more than once to understand it, they will likely move on to another site.</p>\r\n<h3>Headings</h3>\r\n<p>With the barrage of information available on the internet, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">readers tend to skim articles</a> to find what they want. Making content easy to scan is crucial for keeping readers engaged with your practice&#8217;s website. Shorter sentences are faster to read. Paragraph headers make finding information at a glance easier by breaking up content in a concise and organized fashion. Headings, along with short sentences, make navigating a webpage for relevant insight quicker.</p>\r\n<h3>Graphics</h3>\r\n<p>People like visually appealing web pages. Using graphics on your practice&#8217;s page allows potential clients a peek inside your office. Pictures can also draw the eye to other areas you wish to highlight. According to <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module1/Guidelines_for_web_graphics.htm\">washington.edu</a>, website graphics should:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Guide readers to focus on essential portions of the text</li>\r\n\t<li>Conform to the design of the site</li>\r\n\t<li>Not bog the site down with longer loading times</li>\r\n\t<li>Not take away from the content of the page</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Help is at the ready</h2>\r\n<p>The task of creating relevant and easily digestible content for your practice&#8217;s website may feel overwhelming, but we can help.

Structured data is one tool that can be used to push your site to the top of search results. When working toward broadening your client base, utilizing diverse strategies like this can get your practice increased visibility.</p>\r\n<h2>Discover structured data basics</h2>\r\n<p>Much like a shape sorter in preschool, structured data&#8217;s purpose is to categorize and organize similar information. Like SEO, where keywords can generate a higher ranking in search results, structured data can promote a website by offering searchers a snapshot of information about your page. Structured data is similar to a meta description in that it gives a small amount of insight that is then filtered through search engines and displayed according to the terms set out in the markup language. The <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-is-structured-data/\">most common type of information filtered into structured data</a> is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Photographs or graphics</li>\r\n\t<li>Practice name and type</li>\r\n\t<li>Ratings</li>\r\n\t<li>Comments or reviews</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Using data organized in this fashion cuts down the dependence on algorithms to fish for the search results. The structured data puts itself in the position for ranking more readily.</p>\r\n<h2>Boost your webpage ranking</h2>\r\n<p>Sorting information requires rules. Schema.org is the webpage that is responsible for coming up with the categories, structure, and, ultimately, the rules for how data is sorted. It sifts through published webpages and returns them according to these structured data rules. If you fashion your practice&#8217;s website to maximize the established <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/sd-policies\">structured data rules</a>, Google and other search engines are more likely to highlight your page at the top, in the rich results. The more prominent your webpage appears, the more visits you get, and the higher the conversion rate. Using the right data points may land your page in the rich results more often than not.</p>\r\n<h3>Images</h3>\r\n<p>Graphics perform well with potential clients. Why? A webpage that is easy to read through and visually attractive tends to get a higher return rate than those that are devoid of color and images. Plus, when it comes to appealing to structured data, tagging a picture will help push it into the rich results faster. The <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\">photos you choose</a> for your practice&#8217;s page should be relevant and not too overwhelming to sensitive people. Shy away from graphic illustrations or depictions of conditions, viruses, or injuries.</p>\r\n<h3>Ratings</h3>\r\n<p>Your website&#8217;s comment section is one place that may generate a lot of interest in your practice. Prospective clients like to review feedback to get a feel for the type of service you provide. Having your star rating or examples of client comments show up in rich results gives those people searching the chance to quickly see what public opinion has to say about your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Get assistance now</h2>\r\n<p>Getting new clients into your practice requires a reboot of traditional marketing thinking.

Since then, however, search technology has evolved to incorporate artificial intelligence, which enables the search engine to deliver the most accurate results based on several variables, with keywords being just one of them. Google refers to this new and improved search as “semantic search” and scores websites based on their “semantic distance.”</p>\r\n<h2>The introduction of semantic search</h2>\r\n<p>Semantic search is not a new idea, though many brands are only just now incorporating the concept into their content marketing strategies. Back in 2013, Google realized that because <a href=\"https://envato.com/blog/semantic-search/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://envato.com/blog/semantic-search/\">people communicate through conversations, not keywords</a>, it was time to make some serious changes. As a result, it released the Hummingbird algorithm, which was designed to improve the search engine’s understanding of users’ search queries and deliver more accurate results faster.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike previous algorithms, which returned results based solely on keywords, Hummingbird understood that words have multiple meanings. Thus, it used AI to gather information about a user’s location, search history, spelling, and context to better understand the intent behind a search term. Google then used this data to quickly analyze full questions and rank results based on a particular user’s previously indexed content. Content that ranks higher is deemed to have a better “semantic score.”</p>\r\n<h2>Improving your semantic distance score</h2>\r\n<p>Regardless of industry, optimizing content for semantic search is essential. However, because you are in the medical field, it is even more so for your content.</p>\r\n<p>One of the simplest ways to optimize your medical content for semantic search is by using potential patients’ natural language. Medical professionals use highly technical language that is difficult to understand, much less spell or pronounce. Moreover, the medical field is replete with clinical jargon and acronyms with which the average person is unfamiliar. For instance, as a dentist, you may refer to a deep cleaning as “dental prophylaxis.” However, chances are low that anyone other than another dental professional searches for a dentist by that term. By simply describing these services as “teeth cleaning,” you can drastically expand your audience base.</p>\r\n<p>However, improving your semantic score is not as simple as speaking your audience’s lingo. Google considers several variables when delivering results. Below are additional <a href=\"https://blog.alexa.com/semantic-search/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://blog.alexa.com/semantic-search/\">strategies you can use to make semantic search work for you</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Create highly targeted and useful content that <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-neural-matching/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/what-is-neural-matching/\">turns the keyword into the topic</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Optimize content for featured snippets (e.g., clearly answer questions in your content in concise ways and while targeting long-tail keywords)</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search\">Optimize your content for voice search</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Use companion keywords, linguistic variations, and synonyms</li>\r\n\t<li>Add schema markup, or structured data, to the backend of your content to tell Google what your content is about</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Improve your semantic searchability</h2>\r\n<p>Artificial intelligence may be what makes semantic search possible, but improving the semantic searchability of your site does not have to be so technical. In fact, all you really have to do to succeed with Google’s latest algorithms is to offer highly valuable content.
