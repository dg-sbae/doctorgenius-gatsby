While a post may not be necessary every day, it is important to have regular posts that display the website is active. Google sees this as a “freshness signal” that boosts your ranking and will be less inclined to put a website that only posted once in the last 6 months anywhere near the top of search results. Thus, custom blog posts can help to keep a website active.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Content marketing for a medical practice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By uploading content on a regular basis, the website can remain active and help a website be more present in Google searches. In fact, even social media can help to promote a practice. HubSpot finds that in 2017, around 74 percent of people say they use Facebook for professional purposes. While other forms of social media can also be effective, medical professionals can use a social media account to promote new content on websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we can help create blogs to post on our clients’ websites each month. The number of blogs will vary per package but can all aim to achieve the same goal of promoting the client’s practice. We also understand how to craft blogs that utilize keywords to help promote a specific service or type of treatment from the client. The content that Doctor Genius posts on a website can also help bring in new patients and increase the conversion rate; the rate at which people click through a link to the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">HubSpot states that in 2017, at least 53 percent of marketers stated that blog content creation was their top inbound marketing priority.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan18-2-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1107\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan18-2-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan18-2-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan18-2-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>The necessary maintenance and support</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand that while many dental practices provide the same general services, there are specialized services that only certain professionals offer. Thus, we can help customize the content to match those specific services. Our Support Team is available to help make changes to website content in order to help it function at its full potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our content can also help bring in new patients to your practice. In fact, in 2016, Econsultancy found that only about 22 percent of businesses were satisfied with their conversion rates. With constant support and regular content uploads each month, we can help you rank higher in Google search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in enhancing your website, give us a call today.

This untapped market makes up about 75.4 million people according to the Government Census in 2015. However, the census also states that millennials are much more diverse and use various forms of technology for seeking medical care as opposed to traditional methods. Fortunately, Doctor Genius has an event about how to reach this untapped market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Marketing to millennials</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With technological advances, more and more people use cellphones or tablets instead of their computer. At this point, laptops and traditional desktop computers are becoming less of a mainstay in homes. While having a website can help a medical practice reach potential patients, millennials are less likely to search the web and more likely to use social media and apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, Doctor Genius is hosting the event: Marketing to Millennials on March 15, 2018 at the Residence Inn by Marriott Santa Clarita Valencia from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. with dinner included. This event can also add up to 3 CE credits for attendees. For more information on the event or to register, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/events/marketing-millennials-03152018/\">click here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical professionals may not realize that 85 percent of millennials use a smartphone, which grants them access to web browsers, social media platforms, apps and more. Due to this, it is less likely that people will pull out their laptop or computer every night. Medical professionals need a mobile-first website that can adjust to the screen size of the device. Part of marketing to millennials involves reaching them on their highly-mobile digital platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1113\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/study-jan22-2-blog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">5 in 6 millennials connect to businesses via social media.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reaching patients through other digital platforms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media may have started out as a platform for friends to communicate with each other, but has now become a platform for much more. Businesses of all kinds can use social media to reach out to loyal customers and new consumers with active posts. Medical professionals can link to their website through social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the PEW Research Center found in August of 2017 that two-thirds of Americans reported that they got at least some of their news from social media. People are seeking information on these platforms instead of searching for the specific medical service online. Our event will take the time to go over tips and techniques for utilizing these platforms to reach new patients. We can also offer methods for patient retention and maintaining these patients for years to come.

In the beginning, things seem to work out and the website attracts more patients. Over time, less and less new patients contact the practice. Looking online, the professional finds that the website is broken on certain pages and does not appear in the first few pages of most Google searches. This professional needs a company like Doctor Genius to provide constant maintenance for any issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Constant maintenance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for a website to run smoothly, there needs to be constant maintenance from a skilled professional. At Doctor Genius, we have a team of professionals who can provide the necessary website maintenance to help our clients receive the benefits of a website for their practice. If there is ever an issue with the website, we have professionals available to help fix it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also continue to help monitor other mechanisms within the website and ensure that they are running properly. One of the main functions of a website is to bring in new patients.

A call tracking system can help to analyze all marketing efforts of a website and determine which are the most effective. At Doctor Genius, we can help determine what is bringing in new patients and what is not. We can then change the website for these needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Invoca states that 73 percent of marketers prefer to feature phone numbers in marketing emails if they can effectively track the data. While texting is a more common form of communication in other situations, people want to be able to speak with a professional representative about the available services. At Doctor Genius, we can track if the emails with a phone number are effective or if the social media page is the source of new patients calling in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our call tracking system, other services and website maintenance, we can help you reach new patients in an effective manner while also help with patient retention.
