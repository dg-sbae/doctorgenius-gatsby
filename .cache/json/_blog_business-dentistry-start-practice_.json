Get the degree, practice dentistry for a few years, rent the building, purchase the equipment and set up a practice. It sounds easy, right? Unfortunately, setting up a private practice is full of speed bumps and difficulty. A degree and professional experience will not be enough to set up your own private practice. Fortunately, we are teaming up with Burkhart Dental Supply Company and a plethora of guest speakers at an event to provide patients with the advice and knowledge of experts in the field.\r\n<h3>Not as easy as 1, 2, 3…</h3>\r\nWhile there is no single proven method for starting a new practice or magic trick that makes everything come together perfectly, this event can offer the next best thing. We can offer event attendees insight from professionals of various fields that have experience of building a private practice. Individuals interested in acquiring an existing practice or building a new practice will greatly benefit from this event.\r\n\r\nThe event takes place on Friday, April 28, 2017, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., in San Diego, CA.

Unfortunately, a dental visit is most likely not on that list for many people. A dental practice needs to create a positive experience for patients. Fortunately, there are a variety of methods to do just that.\r\n<h3>Build a positive experience for patients</h3>\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, finds that only 62 percent of adults between the ages of 18 to 64 visited the dentist in 2014. The CDC also finds that 83 percent of children ages 2 to 17 visited the dentist at least once the same year. It is apparent that adults do not view dental care with the same level of importance for themselves as they do for their children. While adults may have a variety of reasons for a lack of dental checkups from financial difficulties to busy schedules, adults need regular dental care as much as children do.\r\n\r\nHowever, many adults may avoid necessary checkups due to the negative stigma surrounding dentistry. People associate a dental visit as painful, even though technology has advanced to the point where dentistry is comfortable. Patients may not always remember that a dentist can help keep a smile beautiful and healthy. By creating a positive environment for the patient, a practice can help patients feel more comfortable and welcome during the appointment. A practice can also educate the patients on the available methods and technology, helping patients understand that appointments can virtually be pain-free.\r\n\r\n<h5><em>&#8220;63 percent of the children indicated that they preferred a decorated dental clinic over a plain clinic.&#8221;</em></h5>\r\n\r\nTo do this, professionals need to begin by presenting a comforting office from the waiting room to the dental chair. Having magazines for adults and activity books for kids is one example of how to at least begin to lighten up a room. A practice needs to be responsive to the patient’s need from scheduling the appointment to dealing with insurance coverage and payment after the appointment. A patient wants a great smile, but may not always want to go through the process for the smile if it is a negative experience.\r\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-413\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14b-TheStudy-Live-Laugh-Smile-Build-a-Positive-Experience-for-Patients-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3>Don’t worry, be happy</h3>\r\nA study published online in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, conducted by Maha Al-Sarheed, Ph.D., at King Saud University, had 583 children answer a questionnaire. The child participants ranged in age from 9 to 12 years and attended public schools. The study finds that &#8220;63 percent of the children indicated that they preferred a decorated dental clinic over a plain clinic.&#8221; Even a simple change as some decorations on the wall can have a positive effect on younger patients.\r\n\r\nWhile there is not too much that a professional can do to change a dental procedure, a professional can educate their patients on the procedure prior to beginning. For instance, a dental practice can break down the steps of the checkup process for the patient to understand. The professional can also take some time to ask how the individual is doing since the last checkup. For new patients, the professional can introduce the other members of his or her practice and go over what the practice is about.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the possible methods for creating a positive experience at a dental practice.

While it is great when a practice brings in new patients, it is even better when the new patient decides to continue visiting the practice for health needs. Dentists can retain patients and build lasting patient relationships through specific techniques in the digital market. Fortunately, Burkhart Dental is hosting an event with speakers from our team at Doctor Genius and Nickerson Consulting.\r\n<h3>What you need to know</h3>\r\nTitled, “Are You Retaining New Patients in Your Practice?” This event takes place on Friday, March 17, 2017, at the Marriot Residence Inn 38305 Cook Street, Palm Desert, CA 92211. The event will be from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and will open registration at 8:30 a.m. for attendees. The conference will begin with a continental breakfast before our speakers take the stage to present.\r\n\r\nThe speakers will answer questions that many medical professionals in the field ask and struggle with on a regular basis. These questions include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>How do you determine a true active patient base?</li>\r\n \t<li>How do you determine new patients in your practice?</li>\r\n \t<li>How do you look at retention with new patients?</li>\r\n \t<li>How do you determine growth from these key indicators?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRetaining patients can be difficult for a practice of any medical background. While there are a variety of possible techniques for retaining patients and building a consistent amount of patients, not all techniques will be the most effective. This event will help to offer insight into which techniques are more effective in helping with patient retention.\r\n<h3>Guest speakers</h3>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-386\" src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12b-TheStudy-March-Event-How-to-Retain-Patient-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h5><strong>“Are You Retaining New Patients in Your Practice?” This event takes place on Friday, March 17, 2017, at the Marriot Residence Inn 38305 Cook Street, Palm Desert, CA 92211.</strong></h5>\r\nThere are three main speakers at the event, two of which are speakers from the Doctor Genius team.
