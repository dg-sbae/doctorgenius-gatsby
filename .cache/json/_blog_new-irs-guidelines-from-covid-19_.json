It is also an economic crisis, with<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/new-irs-guidelines-from-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Businesses and individuals have realized that COVID-19 is more than a health crisis. It is also an economic crisis, with people and businesses around the country feeling the sting of lost wages and revenue. The IRS has stepped in to lessen the pain by providing some guidelines for individuals and businesses. These new guidelines will help Americans find steady footing during these uncertain times.</p>\r\n<h2>COVID-19 and tax guidelines</h2>\r\n<p>Most people are aware that the IRS extended the deadline to file taxes to July 15, 2020. What many do not realize is that this is just the tip of the iceberg regarding IRS guidelines for the coronavirus pandemic. The IRS is making it easier for employers to pay employees, even those who cannot go to work due to COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the IRS has relaxed guidelines for those who need to take money out of retirement accounts. Learn more about how these guidelines impact individuals and businesses.</p>\r\n<h3>Employee retention credit</h3>\r\n<p>The Employee Retention Credit is one of the IRS’s most exciting offerings. Businesses of all sizes can apply for this credit. In order to qualify, businesses must meet one of two criteria. First, this credit is available to companies that have suspended by a government order as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, businesses with gross receipts that total less than 50% of what they were in the same quarter of the previous year are eligible.</p>\r\n<p>Companies can be eligible for a credit that is 50% of the qualifying wages, which are capped at $10,000. Employees can include the amount they pay in health care when applying for this tax credit. Once approved, employers can reduce employment tax deposits as a method of reimbursement. If employment taxes do not cover the full credit, the IRS can send direct payments. Then, companies can use the money to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<h3>Paid sick leave refundable credit</h3>\r\n<p>Employees who are sick need to stay home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The IRS has announced a paid sick leave refundable credit to ease the burden on employees and employers. Employees who cannot work due to COVID-19 can receive up to 80 hours of paid sick leave, and the employer receives a fully refundable tax credit. The IRS states that the tax credit also covers the Medicare tax and health care expenses the employer has paid.</p>\r\n<h3>Paid family leave refundable credit</h3>\r\n<p>With schools and childcare facilities shut down, parents are having a hard time getting to work. The IRS announced a paid family leave refundable credit for those who have to care for their children. Employees can take up to 10 weeks of paid family leave, and the employer receives a refundable tax credit. The credit includes health care expenses and the Medicare tax.</p>\r\n<h3>Early withdrawal penalty waived</h3>\r\n<p>Hopefully, people will not have to reach into retirement accounts for money during the coronavirus pandemic. Still, those who have been impacted by COVID-19 can withdraw up to $100,000 without paying the 10% early withdrawal fee. Taxpayers must claim the distribution when filing taxes. They can spread out over three years to avoid paying the full tax obligation at once. Also, those who pay the distribution back within three years will receive a refund on any taxes paid.</p>\r\n<h2>Let the system help you during the COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Worrying about your health and your finances is overwhelming. Fortunately, you do have some financial options to soften the blow of COVID-19. If your company is eligible for a tax credit, take advantage of it. These credits can help businesses stay afloat during this difficult time.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Some of the changes are<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic maintaining an ongoing status, consumer behavior seems to have changed overnight. Some of the changes are only temporary. However, others might become permanent. Businesses must adapt to these changes to serve consumers. Dental practices and businesses that adapt are likely to excel after the crisis.</p>\r\n<h2>Expected changes after the COVID-19 crisis</h2>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a psychological change in consumers. Fear and anxiety drive people. Americans have concerns about products and businesses in ways never experienced before. The crisis has forced people to interact with businesses in new ways, as well.</p>\r\n<p>This crisis has changed customer preference. Many expect the psychological impact to last for the long term. By learning about the expected changes, practices can help to accommodate the needs of customers.</p>\r\n<h3>Technology-enabled solutions are the new normal</h3>\r\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has made consumers turn to technology more to meet their needs. Consumers use technology to shop for groceries, order food, stay connected with people, and more. With the pandemic, patients are now relying on technology to remain in contact with medical professionals, financial situations, and more.</p>\r\n<p>Many people tried online services for the first time during the pandemic. Consumers are likely to continue using technology to aid in everyday tasks. This could create an increase in curbside pickup and grocery delivery, for example. Due to this, it is crucial for medical professionals to utilize online systems.</p>\r\n<h3>Demand for product transparency</h3>\r\n<p>Health and safety will remain a top priority after the pandemic is under control. This will cause more consumers to demand transparency before choosing products. In the past, consumers often believed what companies told them about products. The pandemic has forever changed that. One reason for that is what consumers discovered about hand sanitizer during the outbreak.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html\">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, explains the effects of hand sanitizer on COVID-19. Many consumers relied on hand sanitizer to fight the coronavirus. Then, people found out that products with less than 60% alcohol are not effective. Consumers realized they need to research products to ensure they are effective. Otherwise, products might not deliver on a company’s promise.</p>\r\n<p>Health and safety demands will continue. Consumers will need more transparency from companies. That includes research that proves that products work. Companies that cannot provide this information might have trouble generating revenue.</p>\r\n<h3>An increase in preventive medicine</h3>\r\n<p>The emphasis on health and safety will go beyond consumer-buying habits. Consumers are also expected to make preventive care a priority after the crisis is over. This priority branches to doctor and dental visits that help them stay healthy. Some people skip their annual exams. That is expected to be rare in the coming years, though.</p>\r\n<p>Consumers might not see doctors and dentists the traditional way. The coronavirus crisis has created a boom for telemedicine and teledentistry. Many expect it to continue well after the virus is under control. Many dentists, physicians, and consumers appreciate the ease of telemedicine and teledentistry. It makes it easier to monitor patients and provides consultations.</p>\r\n<h2>Embrace the changing landscape after COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 will have a lasting impact on consumers and the businesses that serve them. Americans understand that life can change on a dime. People are more involved in the products they buy and the care they receive. Businesses, including dental and medical practices, must make changes to meet these demands. Those that do so will meet the needs of consumers and might even enjoy an increase in revenue in the coming year.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

It has altered the way many practices can reach their patients and pushed states to adopt new safety guidelines. While managing your business from home, it&#8217;s essential to know which mediums are still accessible to reach your clientele. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With more people at home, more web searches are happening than before lockdowns went into effect. Many of the businesses that will thrive during this downturn will be the ones who invest in search engine marketing (SEO). While other businesses go dark, an increase in web presence can make you a more prominent voice of authority for organic search. This is especially pertinent for practices vying for local ranking. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Importance of search engine marketing during COVID-19</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Here are four reasons that you should step up your SEO campaigns during this global pandemic:</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">1. SEO brings in customers who are ready to spend</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Having cash flow can be the difference-maker that helps a business survive during tough times. SEO campaigns generate a better return on investment than other marketing techniques. Unlike more general marketing, which may target people by region, search has the power to link a searcher&#8217;s need to their desired service. As </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/on-site-seo-factors/295357/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Search Engine Journal Points out</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, consistent posting, allowing more services online, and designing a user-friendly website will help your online business space overcome changes to Google&#8217;s algorithm. </span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Since businesses have to operate differently due to COVID-19, Google now permits virtual consultations as a </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/9798848?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">GMB listing for telehealth</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> providers.

Scarcity leads to more online searches</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">An increased number of people staying at home means that there will be more people online searching for the things they need. Household items that were once easy to find have virtually disappeared from store shelves. Ranking search terms for any of these hard-to-find products, like toilet paper and hand sanitizer, is a traffic gold mine.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Businesses can also take advantage of the scarcity by ranking for alternatives to these products. This will also lead to a significant increase in traffic during these uncertain times.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3. Search engine traffic can be measured and tracked</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is little guesswork involved when running SEO campaigns. A business&#8217;s analytics gives them detailed information about their users, their behaviors, and the keywords that brought them to their website. It allows owners and managers to tweak their search engine marketing efforts as needed and increase their ROI. Search engine metrics can also help identify poor copy that does not convert. When times are hard, businesses should focus on marketing efforts that can be easily tracked and adjusted.

Things will eventually get back to normal</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While COVID-19 has caused panic globally, it is unlikely to change the way the world works significantly. SEO marketing will continue to be an effective way to reach customers, and businesses that increased their traffic by adapting to the changes the pandemic caused will be better positioned when things get back to normal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even though paid SEO campaigns can lead to positive results in a short amount of time, ranking for hot keywords in your industry takes time. Prime your business to be a winner by getting ahead of your search engine marketing needs and using SEO to generate additional revenue during this pandemic. It is important to follow the trends as </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">online habits are changing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> with more people at home. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SEO Made Easy</span></h2>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you are looking for a professional&#8217;s understanding of how to boost rankings for your website, we have teams trained in ranking practices online.
