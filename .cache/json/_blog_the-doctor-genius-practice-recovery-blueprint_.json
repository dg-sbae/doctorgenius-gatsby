Whether some practices continue to provide some emergency services during the quarantine or had to close their doors, there are various factors that they will need to know before reopening fully. Thus Doctor Genius is working with NextLevel Practice CEO Gary Kadi to introduce the Practice Recovery Blueprint.</p>\r\n<h3>The Solution You Need in One Place</h3>\r\n<p>As we enter the third month in quarantine, state governments are laying out plans to allow more businesses to reopen with modest new operational guidelines. Professional medical practices of all professions are attempting to determine the next steps for reopening. In a recent webinar session in the series &#8220;Certainty in an Uncertain World,&#8221; Doctor Genius&#8217;s Vice President Phil Lopez and Gary Kadi, join others in breaking down what the <a href=\"https://doctorgenius-1.wistia.com/medias/5yv90rvx3c\" target=\" _blank\">Practice Recovery Blueprint</a> includes for medical professionals and why it is so important.</p>\r\n<p>During the appointment, Phil Lopez and Gary Kadi, list off questions and factors that dentists and other medical professionals need to focus on. Lopez elaborates on the partnership with NextLevel Practice to create &#8220;…an all-inclusive solution that meets the needs of your practice,&#8221; also highlighting that &#8220;Our partnership provides the resources that improve your organization&#8217;s operations and empower teams to create a one-of-a-kind experience for patients.&#8221; This partnership can help our clients determine what they will need to reopen and provide the quality services patients need.</p>\r\n<h3>Following the Search Results</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we are constantly monitoring the search results of our content to determine what services patients are searching for. While there was a dip in search results during the earlier weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now seeing an increase in specific search terms.</p>\r\n<p>The actual change in organic traffic growth for dental practices since stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns, went into effect is represented in the graph below. Organic traffic growth is defined as the growth of visitors who found a website through search inquires alone. As can be seen from the graph below, the number of searches by users is growing each week. When we cross-compared these numbers to yearly averages for late March and all of April for other years, we found this growth in visitors to be atypical. In other words, the data is showing that patients have a growing demand to seek out dentists during the COVID-19 crisis. Numerically, there are about 7% more patients visiting dental sites each week from organic search.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2140\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3.png\" alt=\"Growth in Organic Traffic Since Lockdown for Dental\" width=\"549\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3.png 549w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3-300x166.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-3-177x98.png 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" /></p>\r\n<p>Common search terms we see include &#8220;dentist near me,&#8221; &#8220;emergency dentist,&#8221; &#8220;teledentistry,&#8221; and other questions such as &#8220;Can you put a tooth back in your mouth?,&#8221; &#8220;Is a tooth abscess considered a dental emergency?,&#8221; or &#8220;What do you do with a toothache on the weekends?&#8221; to name a few. People are currently in need of treatment and will be once the quarantine lifts. While at this moment, most online inquires show spikes in emergency care needs, we’re also seeing new searches. To prepare for what searches may be relevant going into June and beyond, you may read further into <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-consumer-habits-may-change-after-covid-19/\">our article on changing habits</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Dental practices need to be prepared to provide all of the services patients need. Many of the practices we serve are reporting an increase in customer activity as patients want to put this stall in their work-lives toward staying healthy. Visit <a href=\"https://recoverygenius.nextlevelpractice.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Practice Recovery Blueprint</a> to learn more about how to prepare and reopen with a strong foot forward.</p>\r\n<h3>Starting with The Right Blueprints</h3>\r\n<p>When it comes to providing dentistry in a post-COVID world, dentists will need to consider various factors for providing treatment. Doctor Genius and NextLevel Practice can help dentists find the solutions they need by considering several factors such as:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n\t<li>Implementing new sanitation measures for office staff, guests in the waiting room, and the dental chair</li>\r\n\t<li>Frequency of scheduling appointments</li>\r\n\t<li>Language and message front desk staff members use when communicating with patients over the phone</li>\r\n\t<li>Anticipating specific services online that patients need</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Given how quickly regulations and stay-at-home orders can change under quarantine, Doctor Genius is here to help with short term fixes for sudden issues, which can lead to long term solutions. We will customize the plan to an individual practice&#8217;s needs with relevant content, teledentistry services (to be announced), and specific return-to-work plans. Follow us <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> to see weekly updates in the changing regulations of dental practices and for articles on practice management.</p>\r\n<h3>We Are Here to Help</h3>\r\n<p>If you are unsure of how to help your dental or medical practice back on track and prepare to reopen, reach out to us.

While this concept works in all areas of business and<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/how-to-implement-kaizen-strategies-to-inspire-teams/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Kaizen is a Japanese concept that refers to continuous improvement. While this concept works in all areas of business and personal growth, many medical and dental practices have particularly enjoyed success using Kaizen. The key is to implement strategies that inspire teams. When everyone is inspired and involved, those small improvements add up and create a healthy practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Kaizen strategies to inspire teams</h2>\r\n<p>Employees should be at the heart of a practice’s Kaizen strategy. This goes beyond the top of the chain employees. Everyone, including janitors and support staff, is needed for this strategy to work. Once everyone is involved, employees will feel inspired. To ensure inspiration, employers must train employees, empower them, and measure the results.</p>\r\n<h3>Train employees on Kaizen</h3>\r\n<p>Before a practice can implement Kaizen strategies, it must ensure that employees fully understand it. All employees must receive training on Kaizen. The strategies are simple and include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Improvements with small, incremental changes</li>\r\n\t<li>The ideas come from the employees</li>\r\n\t<li>Feedback for all changes</li>\r\n\t<li>The results are measurable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Practices should train all current employees. Also, new employees should be trained on Kaizen when hired. Once everyone is on the same page, it is time to implement the strategies. Then, the practice can make small improvements and inspire employees.</p>\r\n<h3>Empower employees and teams</h3>\r\n<p>To truly inspire, practices must empower employees. All employees should be encouraged to share ideas to improve their positions. Employees give suggestions to supervisors, who then empower them to implement the change immediately. This gives employees the freedom to make meaningful changes in the workplace.</p>\r\n<p>Practices should also encourage teams to work together to brainstorm ideas for changes. When working in teams, it is common to have several solutions. The team should select one of the ideas and start with it. Then, if that idea does not provide the desired results, the team can try a different idea.</p>\r\n<h3>Measure the results</h3>\r\n<p>Kaizen works because it is measurable. Supervisors must measure the outcome after the changes are implemented. After the results are tracked, the employee meets with the supervisor to go over the results. If both agree that the results showed a positive outcome, the new practice can be standardized and enforced. It will continue to be the standard mode of practice until someone else comes up with a new way to improve the results.</p>\r\n<p>Employees cannot help but feel inspired after their ideas become standard practice. These employees are making a difference on the practice. That causes employees to work hard to come up with additional ideas as well. It is exciting to have a role in changing a practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Grow your practice with Kaizen</h2>\r\n<p>Significant changes are challenging to implement and often do not provide the results you need for your practice. With Kaizen, you can use small changes to transform your practice. You might not notice huge changes overnight, but after using Kaizen for a few months, you will start to see significant results. Possibly, more importantly, your employees will be inspired and take ownership of their positions. Use these tips to implement strategies that get your employees excited to contribute at work.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

However, the financial impact of the pandemic can be limited through a more refined marketing approach. The daily life of prospective patients has temporarily changed, and they are spending more time online and using digital devices more often. As the way patients operate daily has changed, the marketing strategies of practices should also adapt. </p>\r\n<p>Many healthcare and dental practices are turning toward online marketing strategies to weather the storm during COVID-19, and the effort to focus on digital marketing may lead to an increase in long-term revenue and more resilience if a future pandemic occurs.</p>\r\n<h2>Limit the COVID-19 impact on patient acquisition</h2>\r\n<p>Offline marketing strategies that many practices rely upon are simply not effective during the pandemic. Billboard ads are not being seen often, as our nation pushes for a strong effort of social distancing and staying home. Word-of-mouth patient acquisitions are also dissipating, with public gatherings and workplaces canceling until further notice, which limits social interactions.</p>\r\n<p>Digital marketing, however, is far less affected by COVID-19 as <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/31/americans-turn-to-technology-during-covid-19-outbreak-say-an-outage-would-be-a-problem/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/31/americans-turn-to-technology-during-covid-19-outbreak-say-an-outage-would-be-a-problem/\">the use of digital devices increases</a>. There are many ways that practices can strengthen their online presence during the COVID-19 crisis. Notably, cleaning up and improving your practice’s website, increasing content production to reach more prospective patients, and utilizing targeted digital advertisements can all be effective during these trying times. </p>\r\n<h3>Digital marketing can have a long-lasting impact</h3>\r\n<p>Many practices and businesses alike are increasing efforts in digital marketing to make it through the pandemic, as the benefits may lead to long-term gain. Digital marketing is a reliable strategy for patient acquisition that does not only have to be utilized during times of crisis. Some practices that only did just enough in the past to get by with their online presence are now turning toward digital marketing as a way to increase revenue. Establishing a solid digital marketing platform can make businesses stronger for years to come by providing them with another reliable channel for patient acquisition. </p>\r\n<h3>Protect your practice from any future pandemics</h3>\r\n<p>While ideally, we will not see another pandemic for more than a century, the reality is that businesses must prepare for unpredictable scenarios. From natural disasters to public health crises, many unforeseen events can occur. Practices that properly prepare by broadening their outreach are often more resilient. The potential to grow your business through an increase in the patient acquisition, along with the ability to reduce the negative financial impact when people are forced to travel less, enhances the ability of a practice to make it through the other side stronger than ever. </p>\r\n<h2>Find out more about digital marketing strategies</h2>\r\n<p>The temporary effects of COVID-19 put practices in a unique and undesirable situation. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Those who grow their digital marketing efforts during these trying times can be in a better position to weather the storm and become stronger than ever when the dust settles.
