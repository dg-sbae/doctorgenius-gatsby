This program combines our digital marketing solutions seamlessly to drive patients to your practice by leveraging content, utilizing our mobile-first web design, social media, online directories, uploading SEO-centered content, and more. This package can help to benefit your practice in multiple ways and help you continue to experience better connect to your patients for years to come.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of the Patient Experience Package</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your practice may provide the quality treatment that patients need, it is not always easy to have an online presence that reflects that. Along with content that displays the message you want your practice to send patients, it is crucial to create a positive patient experience. A patient’s experience typically begins with visiting your website where they then decide if they would like to proceed to appointments.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>What can the Patient Experience Package do for me?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://go.doctorgenius.com/px\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Px</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers a plethora of benefits, such as:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instilling and promoting proper staff and patient safety</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping ensure patients have a positive experience</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring HIPAA compliance</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping save time, money, and stress</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promoting effective and continued communications with patients</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PMS integration</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leveraging content along with a mobile-first web design</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping websites provide better user experience for ranking</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting up teledentistry</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b><i>Is the patient experience that important for my website?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simple answer is yes. User experience on a website for any medical practice can greatly influence the number of people that see the website and its success. When the right plan in place tailored to the patient’s needs, a dental practice can experience greater success and patient retention. Even with google’s algorithm constantly being updated, an area with consistent importance for ranking is </span><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improving a website&#8217;s user experience</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an article on Search Engine Land, they explain how Google is working to include user experience on websites as a ranking factor. They explain, “That means if Google thinks your website users will have a poor experience on your pages, Google may not rank those pages as high as they are now.” While Google may not enact this update until 2021, there is no reason to avoid getting ready.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius can help enhance the patient experience on your website. Search Engine Land elaborates that the three areas affecting the patient experience on a website are the load time of pages, first input delay, and the visual stability of a page. In fact, Google states in their Webmaster Central Blog that “Through both internal studies and industry research, users show they prefer sites with a </span><a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">great page experience.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these changes on the horizon, it is crucial to have a website and online presence that provides a positive and comfortable patient experience. We can help you build the practice website you need to boost your patients’ experiences from the website to a checkup in the office. For more information on keeping patients interested, please turn to our blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-leverage-technology-to-keep-your-community-informed/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to use tech already at your disposal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the Patient Experience Package Can do for You</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team at Doctor Genius focuses on several areas of our client’s website to provide their practice with an effective and substantial online platform. These can include helping drive patient experience and loyalty, streamlining office operations, providing SEO-Centered content, helping clients stay connected with their patients, and promoting workplace safety. Amidst the post-COVID-19 outbreak world that we live in, people are interested in experiences and interactions with medical professionals that do not require unnecessary physical interaction.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can help to create an online system that promotes a positive experience and more. With the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/the-doctor-genius-practice-recovery-blueprint/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Practice Recovery Blueprint</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we can focus on adjusting your business to meet the needs of these changing times. We will customize the plan for your needs and utilize the Patient Experience Package benefits for even greater results.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>How can you help to streamline office operations?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way to help streamline office operations involves paperless forms on the website. Patients will be able to fill out any and all forms online before the appointment. This way, there are no issues with printing out the forms, filling them out, or forgetting to bring them to the appointment. This can help make sure there is less chance of traffic in the waiting room, as well.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the website can help to get new patients started with scheduling an appointment, we can also use phone systems to help filter calls. This way, the patient will have everything they need to get started from the comfort of their own home.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>Can teledentistry help me remain in contact with my patients?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Teledentistry helps to make the process even easier for patients, allowing them to remain at home during the initial examination. Doctor Genius can help to set up a teledentistry system that will enhance the patient experience. This way, you can continue to communicate with patients, determine if they need to come to the office for treatment, and maintain oral health. This form of patient retention can also help them continue to reach out to your practice with any questions or concerns.</span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>Will SEO get in the way of my message?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not at all. While we will use SEO-focused content to help promote search results in Google listings, it is only one part of the solution. In fact, we will combine SEO with the type of message you want to send patients. Now, more than ever, patients need to know what practice is about and what they offer without issue. We will work with you to combine these into an effective and complete presentation online. You can find out more about how we are staying up to date on the latest changes in SEO best practices by reading how the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most recent core update affects your practice</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><b><i>How do I promote that we are following health and safety guidelines?</i></b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can help to ensure that your office has the proper PPE, and standards in place following the COVID-19 outbreak.

The<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Avoiding duplicate content when creating search engine optimization content has been a source of heated debate among SEO professionals. The debate persists partially due to the incorrect assumption that content that appears as duplication will automatically be categorized as spam by search engines. At Doctor Genius, we strive to provide the most up-to-date and accurate information for your business. That&#8217;s why learning more about how content duplication affects your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-google-core-update-what-the-latest-update-means-for-your-practice/\">rankings</a> can help you make informed decisions about the focus of your marketing and content strategies. </p>\r\n<h2>Should businesses avoid duplicate content? </h2>\r\n<p>When thinking about repetitive content on the web, it&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of believing that if your information is too similar to existing information, it will be automatically be ranked lower on searches. Since somewhere between 25-30% of information on the web is repetitive, it would do a great disservice to consider all of it useless or spam. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZY7EmjbMA&amp;feature=emb_title\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZY7EmjbMA&amp;feature=emb_title\">Search engine programming has evolved</a> to anticipate duplicated information and provide solutions. </p>\r\n<h3>What is duplicate content? </h3>\r\n<p>Content on the internet that is duplicated can be due to the same page being used for multiple locations of the same company or through small parts of existing content being directly reused in blogs as a reference to the original material. Although sometimes duplications are used as manipulation or with malicious intent, such as trying to pass off reused content as new, original content, most of the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en-\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en-\">duplicated content</a> on the web is harmless. Often, multiple variations of the same information end up as duplicate content due to publishing both HTTP and HTTPS versions of websites, pages in different languages, and both www and non-www pages. When the same pages are optimized for both website and mobile use, it can also create repetitive content for search engines. </p>\r\n<h3>How do search engines treat duplicate content? </h3>\r\n<p>Search engines, such as Google, look for identical or very similar pages as a regular part of the content ranking process. Instead of rejecting search results that are the same, the results are instead grouped together under the same search. Similar articles appear as alternative options to the first-ranked article instead of being edited out of the search entirely. Whenever possible, the original source of the content ranks highest along with the webpages that have the most visitors. Google, in particular, has updated algorithms to make sure webmasters aren&#8217;t penalized in the rankings due to content duplication. </p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about SEO content</h2>\r\n<p>The idea that duplicate content on the web hurts companies by negatively affecting rankings is a myth that has been perpetuated by predatory SEO competitors. As confirmed by search engine engineers and major companies, repetitive content is expected and accounted for during the programming process, so it does not cause a problem unless it is purposefully overwhelming to the point of spam or clearly tries to pass off some else&#8217;s original content as their own. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Reach out to us</a> to speak with a team member and learn more about our available services. </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

We can help to set this system up.</p>\r\n<p>What applies to businesses can also apply to dental and medical practices. Here are some various opportunities in store for dental practices that take a proactive approach.</p>\r\n<h2>The Opportunities that lie ahead</h2>\r\n<p>Many companies are not sitting idly and watching the situation unfold. They have adapted to the current situation and expanded their business models, reordered their production lines, and focused on new needs. The summary is that they have observed the market trends and taken calculated risks, using COVID-19 as the rocket fuel for growth in some areas and resuscitating dormant potentials in others.</p>\r\n<p>Many establishments are moving online, digitizing most of their processes to increase the speed of executing projects and eliminating backlogs. In terms of productivity, there has been a significant rise in cloud services for work collaborations, solutions to reduce paperwork and physical contact, reimbursement apps and digital solutions for accounting, and the rise of contactless devices in several areas.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius can help clients build an effective website and system that focuses on reaching patients. We will help to have a set plan in place for when the quarantine restrictions are lifted. The sooner dentists begin taking proactive steps toward the current situation, the sooner they can begin to prepare for success.</p>\r\n<h3>Business models</h3>\r\n<p>A prolonged crisis like this can force changes in customer profiles. Customers’ behavioral patterns are likely to change due to a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, many people will start ordering more regularly and receive door deliveries, even after the lockdown. Others will possibly increase online transactions. Businesses that pay attention to the customer profile changes can go on to build more efficient business models.</p>\r\n<h3>Remote work and service delivery</h3>\r\n<p>Renting an office space can be expensive, and remote work arrangement is yet to be adopted in the full functional scope. This will create opportunities in several and related sectors, including virtual classrooms, office space redesign, development of remote work platforms, online service provisions, software systems, and cloud-based services. All of these sectors will potentially witness drastic expansion when the world starts to recover from the pandemic, and employers look to reduce the cost of office space if their staff needs to work remotely.</p>\r\n<h2>Call Us Today</h2>\r\n<p>The effects of the COVID-19 is under review by many experts, both in terms of medical and business implications. The adverse effects of the pandemic are obvious, but this article seeks to shed light on the opportunities that are available to businesses and other establishments when faced with a crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
