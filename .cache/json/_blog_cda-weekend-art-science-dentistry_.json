Professionals are growing more accustomed to patients avoiding treatment until it is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, a new trend may put patients in more danger and more risk of causing permanent damage than they realize with new DIY, Do It Yourself, orthodontic straightening options.\r\n\r\n<h3>DIY needs more than just instructions</h3>\r\n\r\nIn a report from ABC Action News in Philadelphia, PA, available on 6abc.com, the article states “Orthodontists say this alarming trend appears to be on the rise,” adding that, “Most likely it&#8217;s due to the cost and time it takes for professional straightening.” DIY trends are popular for multiple reasons, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Achieving a sense of accomplishment</li>\r\n \t<li>Saving money</li>\r\n \t<li>Personalizing a useful product to use in the house</li>\r\n \t<li>Creating a fun activity to spend time with others</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHowever, a DIY tooth straightening is not similar to an at-home cure for a sore throat or skin moisturizer. There is a reason that orthodontists are required to have two to three extra years of studying in dental school to specialize in orthodontics and patients need to realize that. The DIY teeth-straightening products range from self-placing rubber bands for closing gaps to even using 3D printer technology for creating orthodontic trays. The American Association of Orthodontics, AAO, explains in further detail on their website, mylifemysmile.org that they are “urging consumers to beware of Internet videos and websites which encourage people to try and straighten their own teeth.”\r\n\r\nThe DIY teeth-straightening products range from self-placing rubber bands for closing gaps to even using 3D printer technology for creating orthodontic trays. Orthodontic dentists have the tools, knowledge and skills necessary to safely perform straightening procedures. Self-straightening options will only cause more issues and risk further damage to the individual’s teeth.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-477\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care-177x118.jpg 177w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/17b-TheStudy-DIY-Self-Straightening-Options-Versus-Professional-Care-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n<h3>Help patients understand the risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be easy for patients to choose a DIY solution instead of a professional procedure after comparing the cost. Patients need to understand why they need to seek professional treatment as opposed to these cheap and dangerous DIY solutions. One effective method of doing this is to create a website that conveys this message.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The American Association of Orthodontics, AAO, explains in further detail on their website, mylifemysmile.org that they are “urging consumers to beware of Internet videos and websites which encourage people to try and straighten their own teeth.”</h5>\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we can help create and maintain an active website that presents the necessary information of a professional’s practice in a readable and informative manner. The AAO continues to highlight that DIY treatment options can lead to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Permanent tooth loss</li>\r\n \t<li>Lifelong dental problems</li>\r\n \t<li>Spending more money to repair the excess damage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPatients need to understand from a professional’s website and visits to the professional&#8217;s office that DIY solutions are not an effective substitute for professional care. Doctor Genius can also highlight and display the professional’s specialties in such a way as to help inform possible patients about these services. At Doctor Genius, we also help build and maintain social media pages to actively engage followers and patients online.\r\n\r\nBy actively engaging patients and displaying information in an effective manner, we can help professionals bring patients in for the safe and necessary care they need. Patients will understand why DIY orthodontic and dental treatments are not the most effective or beneficial option.
