A surprising amount of information about the health of the rest of the body can be revealed through the mouth. A checkup from a Complete Health dentist also involves screening for conditions such as oral cancer and periodontal disease. Although Complete Health is a dental philosophy, there are also medical practices in which general practitioners choose to perform simple procedures rather than referring patients to specialty practitioners.</p>\r\n<p>There are also SEO advantages to expanding your practice in unexpected directions. Patients looking for the additional services you offer may be more likely to find you if they are listed on your website or mentioned in blogs or social media posts. However, while your medical marketing materials should include the services you do perform, it should also identify the services for which you will have to refer patients to other doctors.</p>\r\n<h2>Why is it important to mention services you do not cover?</h2>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians describes the often nostalgic view of <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0900/p33.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0900/p33.html\">general practitioners</a> in the &#8220;old days&#8221; performing all types of medicine. Back then, referring patients to other doctors was not practical and sometimes not even possible. In today&#8217;s world, you cannot do everything related to the practice of medicine, and it is not reasonable to expect it. However, it is to your advantage, and the patients&#8217; benefit, to explain what you do not do.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Communicating honestly</h3>\r\n<p>Successful communication between provider and patient depends on honesty. However, a <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1137\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1137\">survey in the Journal of Health Affairs</a> revealed that a significant portion of the 1,891 respondents admitted to dishonesty in communication with patients, with 20% concealing medical errors and nearly half giving exaggeratedly positive prognoses. Explaining to your patients what you do not do upfront helps lay the foundation for honest communication.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Building a brand</h3>\r\n<p>Thanks to online information from health care websites and review apps, patients tend to be more informed before reaching the doctor&#8217;s office than ever before. This can work to your advantage if you want to be known as the doctor that treats such-and-such conditions in your area. For balance, your brand marketing should include what you do not do as well as what you do.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Managing patients&#8217; expectations</h3>\r\n<p>Patients choose health care providers not only on the basis of medical information but on the advice of family and friends. In many cases, referrals from existing patients represent a sizable portion of new patients. Therefore, one negative experience for a patient who was confused and frustrated about the services you do and do not provide could put a significant dent in your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>How do you communicate which areas require referrals?</h2>\r\n<p>In addition to communicating honestly with patients, you should also be clear in how your relay what services need to be referred. Be sure they are delineated from the services you do provide with an unambiguously worded, eye-catching header.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn effective and responsible medical marketing</h2>\r\n<p>Your medical marketing should adhere to the same standards of responsibility and ethics as the rest of your practice. We devote meticulous effort to creating honest and accurate SEO materials. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Contact Doctor Genius</a> for help creating a campaign worthy of your practice.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

It helps to make it as easy as possible for potential patients to make an appointment, and we all know the simplest solution is often the right one. Here are some reasons why a good call-to-action phrase can make a difference in your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Simplifying the process</h2>\r\n<p>Even the most creative websites are not going to convert clients if the clients are unsure about what the next steps are. Here are examples of how a CTA can convert potential patients by making it easier for them to buy something or make an appointment. </p>\r\n<h3>It encourages obedience</h3>\r\n<p>From even the earliest years of life, people are used to being told what to do. This explains why a CTA in the form of a command tends to be more effective than one in the form of a question. For example, someone is more likely to click on a link or button that says &#8220;Purchase now!&#8221; than one that says &#8220;Are you ready to purchase?&#8221; Using an <a href=\"http://www.smbceo.com/2018/02/16/why-ctas-are-the-most-important-thing-on-your-website/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.smbceo.com/2018/02/16/why-ctas-are-the-most-important-thing-on-your-website/\">authoritative command</a> can be very convincing for many potential patients. Without a CTA, they can be unsure of what to do next. </p>\r\n<h3>It promotes conversion</h3>\r\n<p>In most cases, a simple, direct CTA can convert a client because it does not require much thought. For example, &#8220;Click here to schedule an appointment&#8221; is effective because it both tells patients what to do and allows them to set an appointment without having to call the office directly. Without that CTA, clients viewing the website would have to make a decision about whether that office was the right choice for them, track down a contact number, and call to set up the appointment. Many customers <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/#6936250b801b\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/#6936250b801b\">will not take the time</a> to do that and will look elsewhere. </p>\r\n<h3>It draws the reader&#8217;s attention</h3>\r\n<p>On a page full of black and white words, a bright red button or bold red text can effectively stand out and pull the reader&#8217;s gaze where you want it to go. While viewers already interested in a product or service may take the time to search a website for how to take the next steps towards making a purchase or appointment, it can take something more extreme to convince a bored viewer to pay attention and seriously consider taking another step. A distinct CTA button as a content format feature can also be easier for <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-reach-mobile-users/\">mobile viewers</a> to find. </p>\r\n<h2>Discover how we can help your CTA make an impact on your practice</h2>\r\n<p>Whether this is the first article you have read on CTAs or the 400th, Doctor Genius is here to help.

People are in need of quality health care that is compatible with their current insurance plan, perhaps more than ever in recent history. In addition, now is the ideal time to encourage both current and potential patients to prioritize health and wellness through routine care and the prompt diagnoses of illnesses and developing conditions. As a result, dental and medical practices may need to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/top-7-tips-for-doctors-to-boost-their-online-reputation/\">adjust website content</a> to bring those potential clients through the front door.</p>\r\n<h2>The problem with incomplete insurance information</h2>\r\n<p>When a prospective patient begins searching for a new health care provider, browsing websites is often a starting point. While there may be several factors that influence the decision to make an appointment, patients ultimately need to know that your office accepts their current insurance plan. Your site may offer stunning visuals, excellent content, and stellar reviews. However, if you are missing this key component in the patient&#8217;s decision-making process, you could be losing numerous potential clients. Individuals searching for something new will likely be tempted to keep searching until they find the answers they need.</p>\r\n<h2>The benefits of adding insurance listings to your site</h2>\r\n<p>If you want to bring more patients to your practice, providing a complete, up-to-date list of accepted insurance plans is a good place to start. This eliminates wasted time on both ends, preventing the patient from enduring inconvenient wait times just to get the answer to a simple &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; question. At the same time, your office personnel can avoid the hassle of unnecessary phone calls and stay on task with other responsibilities. When your website provides the patient with all of the essential information up front, the need to continue the search is significantly reduced, if not eliminated altogether.</p>\r\n<h3>Counting on customer loyalty</h3>\r\n<p>The insurance plans and policies you choose to accept will change from year to year based on your business&#8217;s needs. Fortunately, keeping updated insurance listings on your website can help you hold onto devoted patients in spite of a potential drop in coverage. For many people, loyalty to a particular doctor, dentist, or office is far more important than loyalty to the current insurance company. When you combine an atmosphere of <a href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/early/2020/08/10/bjgp20X712349\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/early/2020/08/10/bjgp20X712349\">trust and respect</a> with quality care, there is a good chance your patients will be willing to make things work.</p>\r\n<p>By providing access to this useful information, you can also enable patients to switch plans during open enrollment or a <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/\">major life change</a> to join or stay with your office. In addition, those who are simply shopping for new coverage can be influenced based on the plans your office accepts, especially if it appears to be a good fit for the patient.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you improve your company website</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we are committed to helping health care professionals reach more clients by improving their website and online presence.
