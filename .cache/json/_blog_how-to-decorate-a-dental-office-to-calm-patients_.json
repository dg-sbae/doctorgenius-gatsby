While being professional, a dental office should also encourage a comfortable and relaxing environment for patients. The right design can transform your office and help calm your patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Alleviating Patient Anxiety</h2>\r\n<p>As many as <a href=\"https://www.statisticstats.com/health/dentophobia-statistics-of-dentist-fear-and-anxiety/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statisticstats.com/health/dentophobia-statistics-of-dentist-fear-and-anxiety/\">75% of adults experience fear or anxiety about visiting the dentist</a>. Of those adults, between 5% to 10% have a dental phobia, which is more severe than generalized fear. While the fear of pain is the number one reason for fearing the dentist, a dental office environment can heighten those feelings. Having the right office decor can alleviate tension and anxiety in patients and drastically improve their overall experience.</p>\r\n<h3>Using Decor to Create a Comfortable Atmosphere</h3>\r\n<p>Before decorating an office, think about the way patients feel. Creating a homey atmosphere with decor can calm patients and help them feel at ease. In the past dental offices were characterized by rows of plastic chairs, coffee tables stacked with magazines, and possibly a toy or two for children. Today, this noticeably low-effort decor can send the message of not caring about one&#8217;s patients.</p>\r\n<p>Incorporating elements that one would find in a home can help give patients more positive feelings. Items like a well-stocked mini-fridge, a coffee maker, and comfortable furniture create a more inviting and cheerful atmosphere. As for the artwork, use more unique pieces to make a greater impact. Photos, paintings, and drawings are a great way to inject warmth and personality into the office. Choose pieces that complement the rest of the decor rather than clash with it.</p>\r\n<h3>Adding a Touch of Nature</h3>\r\n<p>Dental offices can easily feel cold, impersonal, and sterile. Adding plants throughout the office can help combat those feelings without buying new furniture or artwork. Flowers and other decorative plants help breathe life into an office and allow patients to feel more at ease. Certain plants like lavender, chrysanthemum, and aloe vera may also have a calming effect on patients. The sight of thriving foliage in a waiting room can make a statement about the level of caring and attention to detail.</p>\r\n<h3>Playing Background Music</h3>\r\n<p>The soothing power of background music is invaluable to dental offices. Studies have shown that slower tempo tunes are great for relaxation and stress management. According to researchers at Stanford University, <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/may31/brainwave-053106.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/may31/brainwave-053106.html\">listening to music has the same effect on brain functioning as anxiety-reducing medications</a>. Offices can play commercial-free, lyric-free background music to help put patients at ease and keep them calm for the duration of their appointments. </p>\r\n<p>Certain types of music are better for stress reduction than others. Celtic, Native American and Indian-stringed instruments are among the top sounds that people respond to favorably. Classical music, light jazz, or other types of easy-listening music are popular choices as well.</p>\r\n<h3>Color Matters</h3>\r\n<p>Although amenities, artwork, and background music are important, color is another significant factor in creating a calm environment for patients. Color is a powerful communication tool that can impact a person’s emotions and physiological reactions. Certain colors are associated with increased metabolism and high blood pressure, while others are associated with calmness and stress release. Using the right colors can help inspire feelings of ease in patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Using the Colors Green, Blue, and Purple</h3>\r\n<p>As the symbolic color of nature, green can evoke calmness and tranquility in patients, making it an ideal color to use as the basis for an office. Some ways to incorporate this color is by painting the walls of patient rooms in a soothing hue of green or adding other green decorations throughout the office. Blue is a popular color in the business world, as research shows that this color can incite feelings of trustworthiness and calmness. Using blue can help patients feel more trusting, which is important for patient retention and helping them feel comfortable. The use of purple can also add a feminine touch to a dental office. Purple combines the calming effects of blue with the energy of red, making it a great accent color for certain types of dental practices.</p>\r\n<h3>Keeping Age in Mind</h3>\r\n<p>It is also important to think about the age group that one&#8217;s practice caters to when decorating an office. Offices that treat adults can use their decor to create an environment where patients can relax. One can also make an office more entertaining for adults by installing televisions to distract patients while waiting or getting a procedure done.</p>\r\n<p>Dental offices that cater to children can incorporate elements to foster a fun and cheerful environment. When designing a dental waiting area for children, one can use bright colors and soft materials with fun toys and games to help keep them entertained and calm while waiting. When serving children, consider adding the following elements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Dedicated play area</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Fun murals and wallpapers</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Healthy snacks and beverages</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Kid-friendly literature</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Kid-sized furniture</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The Modern Patient Experience Begins Online</h2>\r\n<p>Even if an office is calming and comfortable, it is futile if no one sees it.

This tactic is particularly helpful for smaller practices because it is less expensive. This kind of marketing takes place naturally over time and can help draw in new patients.</p>\r\n<h2>Generating Website Growth Organically</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/paid-organic-marketing-strategy-blog/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/paid-organic-marketing-strategy-blog/\">Salesforce</a>, organic marketing is an excellent way to increase website traffic and landing page viewership. Instead of paying for ads or sponsored posts, traffic is generated naturally over time through organic marketing. Check out these examples of organic marketing and how it is beneficial.</p>\r\n<h3>Blog Posts</h3>\r\n<p>Blogs are a great way to reach a large audience online, whether it is one&#8217;s content or someone else&#8217;s. Linking back to blogs on social media is a great way to increase organic traffic to a practice&#8217;s website. Being featured in a blog post can also help gain recognition among members of the local community. Reaching out to writers and asking them to include a website link in a blog can also encourage web traffic. Each time a practice is mentioned in a blog or on another web page, it can help improve its search engine ranking.</p>\r\n<h3>Social Media Posts</h3>\r\n<p>Social media is another aspect of organic marketing. When patients post about a practice or<a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/social-sharing-and-furthering-your-marketing-goals/\"> share its content</a> on social media, it is an opportunity for their followers to not only read the post but repost it themselves. The number of people reading about the practice can thus grow exponentially. One can also use social media marketing to boost organic reach by sharing their website&#8217;s content on social media. With the wide variety of social media platforms available, organic marketing is significant and takes place constantly.</p>\r\n<h3>Case Studies</h3>\r\n<p>Another organic marketing activity is creating case studies. These case studies can be about different topics like interesting cases to specialty treatments. This information provides helpful information for other patients dealing with similar concerns and can attract patients who were unaware of those treatments. Having a case study published can be a great way to promote services and gain credibility.</p>\r\n<h3>Email Blasts</h3>\r\n<p>Emails sent to existing or prospective patients are also organic marketing. These emails can be about a new service offering or a more advanced treatment method. Updating previous patients with these emails can be an effective way to help them remember one&#8217;s practice and possibly spread the information organically to the people around them.</p>\r\n<h2>Feel Confident About Your Marketing Strategy</h2>\r\n<p>Organic marketing is one possible element of an effective marketing strategy.

However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/what-is-barnacle-seo/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>Using the right keywords is important for your business. However, it can be difficult for small and new businesses to rank on their own with so much competition. Barnacle SEO is an effective technique in these situations to help such businesses rank for competitive keywords. Here is why this technique is effective and why our team at Doctor Genius prefers to use it.</p>\r\n<h2>An Overview of Barnacle SEO</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008, Search Influence&#8217;s Will Scott coined the term &#8220;barnacle SEO&#8221; to describe the process of smaller businesses attaching their names to larger, more established domains to benefit from their authority. Using established websites that rank for the most popular and competitive keywords can help a small or new business rank higher without doing the same work necessary for traditional SEO.</p>\r\n<p>Barnacle SEO mimics the relationship that takes place in the natural world between barnacles and whales. Barnacles, tiny arthropods no bigger than an inch in diameter, attach themselves to a moving object, like a whale, to gather nutrients from the current. Similar to this relationship, a business can benefit from attaching its name to a search engine whale. The business can go wherever the search engine whale goes, even to the top of the SERPs. The barnacle and whale relationship is a commensal one. The barnacle does not hurt the whale, nor does it help it. However, in order to make the most of the barnacle SEO technique, it is important to act more like a partner to the big websites and less like a parasite.</p>\r\n<h3>Guest Blogging</h3>\r\n<p>Guest blogging is one of the most popular barnacle SEO activities. This particular strategy involves reaching out to websites and pitching a guest blog post. Doing this can seem intimidating for small and new businesses. However, blogs with authority may be willing to work with smaller ones, especially if helping out means adding another article to be ranked on their website. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before reaching out to a website, it is beneficial to research topics that are trending in a particular niche. It is also helpful to consider topics that have not had much coverage but may benefit readers. Identify top blogs and craft an attractive pitch for a guest blog post. If the website is big enough, a guest blog can receive many visitors and shares.</p>\r\n<h3>Types of Websites to Target</h3>\r\n<p>Using barnacle SEO does not always involve asking for a guest blog appearance. Another activity involves targeting websites that people use daily. These websites are online directories and publishing platforms. Some commonly used websites for barnacle SEO are Google My Business, Angie&#8217;s List, Facebook, and TripAdvisor. It is also beneficial to identify websites that specifically cater to one&#8217;s niche. Once the target sites are identified, one can create a profile to list their business and begin using barnacle SEO.</p>\r\n<h3>Leverage Review Sites</h3>\r\n<p>There are several benefits to leveraging review sites. One significant advantage is that it can help with SEO. Review sites like TripAdvisor, Google My Business, Yelp, Angie&#8217;s List, and Foursquare have a lot of search engine authority. Make sure to keep all information up-to-date on each review site. It is also essential to complete a profile and include all the information that potential customers will need, like the business location, hours, and services. </p>\r\n<p>A strong profile with positive customer reviews can help to rank higher for local searches. In addition to boosting online reputation, it is also a great way to get more direct and organic traffic. When creating a profile, it is also necessary to consider the types of terms that typically rank well for review sites. Some examples are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">(Product or service) review</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">(Product or service) alternatives</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Tools like (product or service)</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Writing for Publishing Platforms</h3>\r\n<p>Listing a business on online directories is a popular barnacle SEO strategy, but other options can also yield good results. Writing for any of the many publishing platforms can help expand reach. One of the most popular and effective publishing platforms is Medium. Medium consistently ranks on the first page for competitive key terms in various industries, from business to health. Another benefit of Medium is that its results often include featured snippets.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-a-post\">Publishing on Medium</a> is fairly straightforward. It is acceptable to target an industry&#8217;s most competitive key terms when using barnacle SEO. Here is an overview of the process:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Conduct keyword research</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Select the search intent</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Optimize content so it aligns with the target keyword</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use subheadings and incorporate keywords where possible</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Embed or add creatives, such as images, infographics, and video</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Above all, make sure the writing is of high quality. Medium has domain authority, so write like an authority figure. The content should be easy to read and understand but also informative and factual.
