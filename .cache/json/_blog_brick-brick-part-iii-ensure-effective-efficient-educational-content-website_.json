Medical professionals need accurate and engaging information that reaches out to potential patients and captivates them. However, there are several other purposes for online content outside of being a source of information that portrays a message.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Including keywords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Keywords are a particular word or phrase that help a website rank on search engine results. When someone is in need of a specific medical service, he or she will type in a specific phrase or set of words. We can measure which sets of phrases are more common than others and use them within the content of your website. While keywords can help a website rank, they are not enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keeping a website active</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>HubSpot states that about 53 percent of marketers say that blog content creation is their top inbound marketing priority in 2017. By creating, customizing and posting blogs on a monthly basis, we help to keep your website active and appearing on Google’s radar. This helps Google to see that the lights are still on at home and place your website on the search results. By including these steps and other tools, we can help increase the rank of a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Targeting specific audiences</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We can create content that targets specific demographics and age groups of potential patients. After all, HubSpot found that in 2016, about 43 percent of people admitted to only skimming blog posts. It is no surprise that people are not always going to just stumble onto a blog post from a medical professional’s website. Thus, Doctor Genius will create custom content that targets specific audiences to bring in more website views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With titles and phrases that advertise a specific service, we can help identify the most popular demographic to reach. However, there are other ways to help a blog or website appear in search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Effective Online Content\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-945\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct10-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">In 2015, eMarketer found that 8 out of 10 marketers worldwide use location targeting in mobile advertising.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Geo-Targeting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Verge, states that in May of 2017, Google has more than 2 billion monthly active devices on Android. Monthly, Google has over 1 billion people using Chrome, Maps and Search. By creating mobile first websites, we can help our clients reach patients over multiple digital platforms. More importantly, we can target people by area. Geo targeting allows us to customize and build content for people in a specific area. With geo targeting, we help our clients reach areas surrounding the zip code they practice in, as opposed to only reaching residents directly nearby.</p>\r\n<p>By using Doctor Genius, you can feel assured in knowing that we are attempting to reach potential patients through multiple electronic devices in surrounding areas for a better chance at a higher ranking and more patients.

The crucial aspect of content marketing is the rate of published content for a website. The content rate will help keep a website active and up on the front lines of search results. While the quality of content is important, the rate of content is just as important.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keep it running</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Active content that holds some form of relevance for the website can help to bring in more traffic. In 2015, Ascend2 found that 72 percent of marketers agreed that relevant content creation was the most effective content strategy. While quality is still crucial to promoting a website, there needs to be a steady flow of content. Posting a blog once every few months will not be effective. We can post multiple blogs a month on your website and promote them through social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Software engineer, author, and founder of WanderlustWorker.com wrote in a Forbes article that “in the beginning, Google doesn&#8217;t trust you,” adding, “If Google doesn&#8217;t trust you, you&#8217;re not going to rank on those lucrative first-page SERPs*. You&#8217;ll be lost in the fray amidst millions of others who&#8217;re trying to claw their way to the top.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that people cannot take shortcuts in posting content on a website. “Thin content with errors, or duplicate content and spun content can really hurt you,” Adams explains. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can provide clients with effective content that reaches potential patients on the website and on other social media platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Branching out to other platforms</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Branching Out Into SOcial Media\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-959\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct17-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">HubSpot found in 2016 that for the previous two years, content consumption on Facebook had increased by 57 percent.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If online content is one thing, it is versatile. Online content can branch out to multiple platforms of social media that all lead back to the client’s website. By utilizing social media platforms to share content on a website, Doctor Genius can help clients gain increased website traffic. In 2016, HubSpot also found that 76 percent of people use their Facebook feed to find interesting content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius will not only post engaging content onto your website, but we will also create posts for social media accounts that lead patients to your website.

Those numbers only continue to rise as social media becomes a dominating presence in the digital landscape. Companies and private practices alike are all using social media to reach social media users and convert them into patients/customers. Known as conversion, Doctor Genius has the right tools to help accomplish this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Engaging social media users</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While people believe that using a social media account is fairly easy, effectively using one to convert users into patients is exceedingly difficult. Hubspot finds that in 2017, approximately 74 percent of people use Facebook for professional purposes. Statista states that Facebook had 1.13 billion daily active users in 2016. Social media is a thriving platform for medical professionals to reach potential patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hootsuite.com defines conversion rate as “a positive action that is taken on a website by a visitor from social media,” adding that “The action demonstrates that the visitor is “converting” into a customer.” Even with a website, ranking high on search result is not an easy task. With how busy many medical professionals can get, maintaining a social media account can become exceedingly difficult. Fortunately, Doctor Genius can work to provide regular posts to engage followers on different social media accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engaging users on a regular basis is necessary for a social media account to reach potential patients and hold relevance on users’ feeds. In other words, if a social media page does not continue to make new posts and share content on a regular basis, people are less likely to even notice it in their feed. However, posting on a regular basis is only the first step.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Converting social media users into patients</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"Necessary Tools for Conversion\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-931\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/study-oct3-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;\">Social Media Examiner found that in 2015, around 90 percent of all marketers using social media, generated more exposure for their business.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Posting content on social media is important but it is even more crucial to post content that brings users to a professional’s website.
