As the numbers grow and more areas go into lockdown, its impact on businesses is profound and unprecedented by anything we have seen in recent times. As governments take drastic measures in response to coronavirus, practices also need to adjust quickly to navigate the financial and operational difficulties that accompany the pandemic. This article contains insights from experts on how to scale your business during COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h2>Scaling your Business during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>The following are ways that practice owners can scale their establishments during the pandemic:</p>\r\n<h3>Provide flexibility</h3>\r\n<p>Stores, businesses, schools, and commercial centers around the country are shutting down operations. As the country approaches total lockdown, business owners need to give their employees more flexibility with time.</p>\r\n<p>There are many tools available to business owners to ensure efficient communication with their employers. This will allow everyone to stay in touch and keep working even if they are not in the office. There should be a policy in place regarding work policy, like when team members need to be online and available, a medium of communication (like Slack, Google Hangouts, or WhatsApp) and the deliverables for each team member.</p>\r\n<h3>Enable direct communications with customers</h3>\r\n<p>This crisis affects everyone, so it is better to be completely open about what the business is experiencing. Customers will understand the challenges that the brand is facing if they receive regular updates. When customers no longer have access to the details about the efforts done behind the scenes to get routine services, their appreciation for the service reduces, and they begin to value it less. Business owners need to explain the measures they are taking to curb risks and provide insights into the steps they are taking regarding community service.</p>\r\n<h3>Shift your sales tactics online</h3>\r\n<p>When physical locations are no longer an option, savvy business owners need to consider leveraging online platforms to curb heavy losses. Digital platforms enable interactions with customers and boost online sales. This could significantly increase the company’s sales. Businesses can keep your employees engaged and earning by selling on social media and websites, using email lists, and generating new leads with the internet.</p>\r\n<h3>Capitalize on the brand’s value</h3>\r\n<p>Brands add value to their customers, and the products or services that are beneficial during the crisis deserve the consideration of those who need them. If what the practice does supports or eases people’s lives during the lockdown, business owners need to capitalize on that and tell the brand’s story. As long as the practice focuses on delivering value, marketing and sales will continue.</p>\r\n<h3>Make necessary evaluations</h3>\r\n<p>To keep the practice running throughout the coronavirus pandemic, owners need to make critical evaluations of what matters more to the company’s survival. This includes evaluating the supply chain for vulnerabilities and identifying teams and workers that ensure essential operations or services keep running.</p>\r\n<h2>Importance of staying resilient</h2>\r\n<p>It is hard to tell when the COVID-19 pandemic will end. However, business owners can scale their businesses and stay on top of the situation by staying proactive and taking necessary measures. It is in times like this that the strength of the practice is put to the test, and those who adapt survice.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Dentists have a high risk of being infected due to their proximity to their patients while performing treatments.</p>\r\n<h2>How COVID-19 is changing the dental market</h2>\r\n<p>The outbreak of the coronavirus has left many business owners wondering how they will take care of their expenses. Dental clinics fall under this umbrella because many are small businesses run by a single owner.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/infectious-diseases-2019-novel-coronavirus?utm_source=adaorg&amp;utm_medium=VanityURL\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://success.ada.org/en/practice-management/patients/infectious-diseases-2019-novel-coronavirus?utm_source=adaorg&amp;utm_medium=VanityURL\">American Dental Association</a> has recommended that dentists only offer emergency services to their patients as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow. Many dentists are following the recommendations of the ADA and cutting back on their hours of operation. Some clinics are even shutting down completely in the midst of all of the uncertainty. Dental clinics are also highly impacted by the scarcity of essential items like face masks, which help protect dentists and their patients.</p>\r\n<p>Dentists will have to look for creative ways to help their patients and keep their businesses running while trying to practice social distancing. Some dentists are now using their websites and phone lines to help their patients. Patients are screened over the phone to understand the nature of their problem, and the dentist can give them advice on how to proceed. Patients with issues that require emergency dental treatment are asked to come to the clinic. Screening patients helps limit the number of people at the clinic at any given time, which makes it a safer environment for everyone.</p>\r\n<h2>The Importance of providing emergency dental treatments</h2>\r\n<p>Dentists have a responsibility to treat patients with dental emergencies because failing to do so would leave emergency rooms — many of which are already at their max capacities due to the pandemic — with an additional burden to take care of. The White House agrees with the ADA&#8217;s recommendations in terms of advising the population to delay elective dental or medical treatments while COVID-19 remains an issue.</p>\r\n<h3>Increasing hygiene practices</h3>\r\n<p>Dentists also have a responsibility to protect themselves and their patients during this outbreak. Social distancing should be practiced in waiting rooms with patients sitting six feet apart from each other. This should be easier to manage if only patients with dental emergencies are allowed in the clinic.</p>\r\n<p>Tele-dentistry companies will likely emerge as winners during this pandemic because people with non-essential dental needs are now more likely than ever to try such services. Brick-and-mortar dentist offices should also start developing ways to perform non-essential treatments without a need for patients to come to the clinic.</p>\r\n<h2>Help is available for the dental industry</h2>\r\n<p>The U.S. government has passed a $2-trillion stimulus that aims to provide some relief to businesses that have been hit hard by the coronavirus. Programs that dental clinics qualify for include:</p>\r\n<p>Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL): These loans are being provided on a first-come, first-serve basis. It provides an emergency grant of up to $10,000 that must be used to pay overhead expenses, employee wages, or rent/mortgage.</p>\r\n<p>Paycheck Protection program: This can give small businesses up to 2.5 times their monthly payroll to keep them afloat.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

An optimistic mindset would suit you better, though. Research shows that having a positive mindset helps strengthen your immune system, your body&#8217;s first line of defense against the COVID-19 virus.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping a positive mindset during COVID-19</h2>\r\n<p>Studies have shown that <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html\">stress sources, like tension at work or marital spats, can promote diseases and hinder recovery</a>. Here are simple things you can do to keep your stress levels at a minimum during these uncertain times:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Establishing a work-life balance</h3>\r\n<p>Having a good balance between the time you spend working and the time spent doing things that refresh you (like spending time with family) is one of those things that most busy people struggle with, particularly business owners. With most of the country under some form of quarantine. People now have more time to spend with their loved ones and improve their relationships.</p>\r\n<p>It is best to be proactive about your work-life balance. Plan our your daily schedule ahead of time and include activities with the family, like helping the kids with their remote learning.
