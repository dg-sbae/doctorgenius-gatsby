Most people prefer pictures that describe the story or advertise the product. If a webpage was going to describe the process for dental implants, people will wonder what a dental implant looks like and how it looks in the mouth. Instead of the individual going to Google for answers and leaving the website, give the individual what he or she wants by including informative images on the webpage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Giving your practice a face</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Images on a website can accomplish a variety of tasks with even only a few pictures, including images of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Your location</li>\r\n \t<li>The head medical professional</li>\r\n \t<li>The team members at the location</li>\r\n \t<li>Various tools and rooms of the facility</li>\r\n \t<li>The map view of practice from Google Maps</li>\r\n \t<li>Your logo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Images can put a face to the practice that act as trust signals for potential patients. For instance, an individual is less likely to consider a practice with no image of the medical professional in charge and only text that states the professional’s background. It is also important to take a few quality photos of the team members, outside of the facility and rooms within the facility as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These images can help people get a clear picture of the location they are considering for professional medical care. It is also beneficial to break up the text on other pages of the website with images showing various services or actual patients rather than stock photography. By utilizing quality content with images that promote a happier response from potential patients, you can increase the chance of people spending more time on your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-left:20px;font-style:italic;margin-top:20px;\">Buzzsumo states that in 2015, Facebook posts with images saw more than double the amount of engagement than those posts without images.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keeping a strong presence on social media</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1060\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/12/study-dec5-blog-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Even with the above statistic, text is still important and people still read. However, people surfing social media will spend less time reading a long post about dental hygiene or another medical service if there is no image. In many cases, people will scroll right by the post without even noticing. Thus, it is important to include images or video in social media posts to promote your practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Buzzsumo also adds that in 2015, articles with an image once every 75 to 100 words, received double the number of social shares than articles with fewer images. While this statistic may change in the following years, it is important to note that images only work in the proper location. Without knowledge on where to place them, people may misuse images or oversaturate a webpage with too many images and not enough content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we understand the crucial locations to place images and how to use them to help promote a website online.

With that in mind, we are hosting a webinar on the newest RankBrain update that can affect your practice website and the number of people who see your website in Google search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is RankBrain?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first question probably running through your mind is “What is RankBrain?” Google has created a machine-learning artificial intelligence system that helps Google process its search results, known as RankBrain. While this may not seem like something that could heavily impact your website, there are three main ranking factors that Google relies on, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Links</li>\r\n \t<li>Content</li>\r\n \t<li>RankBrain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>RankBrain is a machine-learning AI, which means that it can acquire knowledge by building on what it already knows and from what one teaches to it. In other words, RankBrain will ignore websites with low-quality content in search results. This will only make it more difficult for people to find your website in search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" width=\"696\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rankbrain-img2-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>It is crucial to have a team who understand how this update works and how to implement quality content that helps potential patients find your website and remain on the website pages longer than other websites. The bounce rate is the rate at which people view a webpage and leave it, “bounce,” for another page. In fact, lower bounce rate as a byproduct of high-quality content.
