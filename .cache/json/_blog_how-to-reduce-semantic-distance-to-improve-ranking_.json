Focus on this has created an entire marketing industry that revolves around <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\">search engine optimization</a> and tools to increase a site’s chances of being viewed. One strategy that many have not heard of focuses on semantic similarity and semantic distance to promote content based on the words themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Natural language processing</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2020/02/12/6-ways-to-boost-your-marketing-with-natural-language-processing/#26a33df4415b\">Natural language processing</a> is a tool that search engines use to help find content that matches a specific search. An AI identifies certain words in a section of text that it deems particularly important — more important than the rest of the text. These words are often nouns or pronouns, like names, businesses, numbers, and locations, and the AI picks them out to determine how a webpage should rank with related search terms. A good content writer can take these words and integrate them as relevant SEO keywords, producing a higher rank overall for a website.</p>\r\n<h3>Scoring term frequency</h3>\r\n<p>In every document, those specific words, called entities, can be matched with certain search words. However, not all-important terms in a document identically match someone’s search. The AI&#8217;s score is based on how often a word or term appears in the text. The more it appears, the higher it is ranked in terms of importance. However, if the same word or phrase appears across many texts online, its ranking may get lowered because its popularity indicates it is simply a general term (and is therefore not as important). Balancing these two factors is key in getting the most out of your document terms.</p>\r\n<h3>Scoring semantic similarity</h3>\r\n<p>&#8220;Semantic&#8221; refers to the meaning of words. When ranking similarities between words, natural language processing considers how two words may fall in the same category when compared to words that do not relate to them at all. This process can be helpful for finding websites that are relevant but may not contain the exact words in a user&#8217;s search.</p>\r\n<h3>Reducing semantic distance</h3>\r\n<p>Semantic distance is how far apart two words appear in natural language processing. By using words that relate to each other and so fall into the same categories, a writer can produce content that is more likely to be picked up by search engines looking for similar words. That said, beyond simply identifying content topics, with semantic similarity there is a greater chance of sites being organized and ranked based on content. This can make the rankings more convoluted, which is why including words that are similar to search terms can rank your site higher in regard to both organization and topic.</p>\r\n<h2>Find more ways to reduce semantic distance in your content</h2>\r\n<p>Reducing semantic distance can be a challenge when you do not fully understand how words and terms play into search engine rankings.

If you are like many business owners, you<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-building-in-feedback/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>To enable comments or not to enable comments, that is the question. If you are like many business owners, you fear that by adding a comment section to your blog or website, you are inadvertently inviting negative feedback. Negative feedback, especially when shared in such a public way, can adversely affect visitors’ perceptions of your practice or brand. Add to this the fact that enabling comments is time-consuming, as commenters often expect responses, and that it requires moderation to deter junk commenters, you may feel that the answer is obvious: Keep the comments off. However, at Doctor Genius, we encourage you to do the opposite.</p>\r\n<h2>Reasons to incorporate a comment section into your site design</h2>\r\n<p>The marketing world has long been in debate over the whys and why-nots of a comments section on a blog. You can check out the for- and against- arguments on <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/\">Optinmonster</a>, but we want to share our thoughts with you below.</p>\r\n<h3>Build a network</h3>\r\n<p>Content marketing serves three major purposes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>To help your site gain rankings</li>\r\n\t<li>To establish your practice as an authoritative presence</li>\r\n\t<li>To build relationships with current and potential patients</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Allowing feedback enables you to do the third by giving you a way to connect with your followers, to develop relationships based on mutual interests and respect, and to turn an otherwise static piece of content in a living conversation. In short, it allows you to build a network.</p>\r\n<h3>Encourage constructive criticism</h3>\r\n<p>You create content for your audience members, so allow them to make suggestions. Turn the comments section on to encourage feedback regarding an article’s content and to invite ideas for improvement and future topics. This type of constructive criticism gives you a tangible sense of how your audience responds to your content, as well as ways you can improve it so that it resonates positively with the intended recipients.</p>\r\n<h3>Contribute to your SEO</h3>\r\n<p>Many website owners who turn off the comments section fail to take into consideration the SEO value it offers. While a handful of comments is unlikely to make a difference for any given page’s rankings, dozens to hundreds of comments can. How? The reason is two-fold.</p>\r\n<p>First, comments contribute to page length. Second, more words on a page gives it an opportunity to rank for more keywords. To determine whether this contributed to increased search traffic, <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/\">Neil Patel</a> conducted an in-depth study. He found two things to be true.</p>\r\n<p>The first was that, on a comments section that added nearly 4,000 words to a page, approximately 26% of keywords that ranked in Google came from the comments section. The second was that the section garnered approximately 16% of the article’s traffic. Though incorporating feedback into your site design may make more work for you, the results can be well worth it.</p>\r\n<h2>The smart way to enable comments</h2>\r\n<p>A section that encourages feedback can help in multiple other ways, such as keeping your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/\">site live</a>, encouraging customer loyalty, and serving as social proof. Of course, there are the drawbacks to consider, but those become a moot point when you have a dedicated account manager moderating comments, responding to feedback, and, of course, dealing with the back-end issues.

Search engine giants like Google have started using a salience score to analyze and prioritize search results. To understand how entity salience can help your website perform better in the result rankings and improve search engine optimization, you first have to learn what an entity is and how salience applies to it.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding natural language processing</h2>\r\n<p>Google and other sites use natural language processing to determine the overall meaning of text content on a webpage. This function is carried out by an artificial intelligence program to identify what a real human would find important in a block of text. You can improve content management by focusing on entity salience, though it is important to note that entity salience is not the same thing <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/duplicate-content-is-safe-for-seo/\">as SEO keywords</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Entities</h3>\r\n<p>An entity is usually a specific word in a text that references a noun. For example, a person, a business, a product, and even a number may be recognized as entities within a body of text. A natural language processing AI can identify entities even when they are not specifically named, like when a named person is mentioned again in nominal form. The identification of these entities is the first step toward building a salience score.</p>\r\n<h3>Salience</h3>\r\n<p>When referred to an entity, salience means exactly what its <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salience\">Merriam-Webster</a> definition is: being especially noticeable or conspicuous. In text, entities that are salient are those words that the AI detects as being important or prominent to a real person. This does not necessarily mean that someone who reads a website’s content will pick up on all those words. The AI simply uses its estimation of salient entities to create a score of readability and SEO popularity.</p>\r\n<h3>The salience score</h3>\r\n<p>Several factors contribute to how these entities are identified through natural language processing. From a single block of text, an entity may be chosen because of its location in the text, its grammar, if it is linked to sections of the sentence, and how much it stands out. Again, names, nouns, and pronouns all get bonus points in the process. The distinction between entities and keywords is incredibly important to content writers, as a writer can work to incorporate an entity and keyword closely together so that they both rank higher together.</p>\r\n<h2>Calculating your salience score</h2>\r\n<p>Since salience scores are not yet fully popularized and it is not clear how much they may improve website SEO, finding a website to calculate your score can be difficult. Lexalytics and the Google Natural Language API Demo are both options where you can type in text and see how it ranks. By experimenting with different types of texts, you can discover what entities get identified the most and how to write content around salience and SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>Learn more about salience scores for your website</h2>\r\n<p>There is still a lot that needs to be explored with entity salience.
