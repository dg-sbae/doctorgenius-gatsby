Attracting people with eye-catching and informative blogs can help drive potential clients to view the site and eventually to set appointments.</p>\r\n<p>One element that you may hesitate to include on your site is a place for people to provide feedback. However, failing to do so may cause you to miss opportunities to get ranked higher in search results and make improvements to the practice. Discover how asking for feedback can take management at your practice to the next level.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of an open comment section</h2>\r\n<p>Reviews and opinions have become essential resources people consider when viewing a new practice or product. If a company does not ask for feedback, prospective clients may look elsewhere. When devising a site design, the placement of feedback can vary. A link at the footer of each page is one option. Popup feedback prompts at various spots on the site is another way to collect this data. Gathering feedback demonstrates that your practice welcomes opinions, and it gives you the chance to improve the business.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to utilize feedback for the better</h2>\r\n<p>The more you interact with people on your site, the higher the page may rank in search results. This is in part due to the way search engines calculate the trustworthiness of a website. When engines like Google find a site trustworthy, it bumps it up higher in the ranks. This, in turn, helps <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/back-to-the-basics-3-fundamentals-of-marketing-you-need-to-do-today-to-stay-afloat/\">market your practice</a> to a broader audience. Engaging with those who submit feedback demonstrates management&#8217;s willingness to address issues and make changes. Some simple actions may help improve your business tremendously.</p>\r\n<h3>Reexamine current processes</h3>\r\n<p>When a client provides a negative review or expresses discontent, take a look at the current processes. When you actively work to change things after receiving negative feedback, you increase the chances of attracting new patients. For instance, improving the check-in procedure after getting complaints about it can help the flow of traffic in the office. It may also cut down on unnecessary work for employees.</p>\r\n<h3>Take visible action</h3>\r\n<p>As a manager, it is important to think carefully about what you need to do to rectify a negative experience, especially if it involves addressing an employee&#8217;s actions or behavior. As <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/29/8-ways-negative-feedback-can-lead-to-greater-success-at-work/#5f20f2d32c69\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/29/8-ways-negative-feedback-can-lead-to-greater-success-at-work/#5f20f2d32c69\">Forbes.com</a> points out, the more you focus on the opportunity for improvement, the better workers will handle negative feedback. Aside from taking action within the practice, you must respond to the original post. When potential clients can see that you made a timely response, it increases your authority and legitimacy. Because medical practices rely heavily on word of mouth for new patients, the faster you respond to feedback, the greater the chance people will take note.</p>\r\n<h2>Get help with your site</h2>\r\n<p>Maintaining a successful practice takes a great deal of work.

As experts from the University of Illinois have found, the mouth is the leading entryway to the body and is known as the window to a person&#8217;s general health. A complete health dentist understands the connection between oral and overall health, running their practice on the application of modern dentistry with a focus on systemic relief.</p>\r\n<p>Patients who take proper hygiene measures to ensure their oral health is up to par may have fewer general health problems. Although many conditions, illnesses, and diseases are genetic, it is possible to combat others through proper oral hygiene. Understanding and applying the oral-systemic link can profoundly enhance patients’ health and well-being and provide new fundamentals that can improve your practice’s profitability.</p>\r\n<h2>Dental Conditions That Can Be Detected</h2>\r\n<p>Regular dental checkups provide dentists with information regarding a patient’s oral health and any problems they may have. A complete health dentist considers the oral-systemic link and conducts a more intensive, thorough examination of not just the mouth but the entire face, neck, and throat. This allows them to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a person’s health and come closer to diagnosing any dental conditions.</p>\r\n<h2>Cavities and Cracked Teeth</h2>\r\n<p>Cavities and caries are the root causes of initial tooth decay caused by a breakdown of the tooth&#8217;s enamel. Cavities are also the leading cause of tooth decay and tooth loss. According to the CDC, &#8220;Untreated tooth decay can lead to [an] abscess (a severe infection) under the gums which can spread to other parts of the body and have serious, and in rare cases fatal, results.&#8221; Infections include gum disease, and, in more severe cases, periodontal disease, which can both impact the body systems, especially the digestive and respiratory tracts.</p>\r\n<p>Cracked teeth can occur in a variety of ways: craze lines, cracked cusps, cracked teeth, and split teeth. Cracked or broken teeth can cause many oral and general health problems, as cracks give way to bacteria and infection. The Oral Health Foundation finds that &#8220;If they are not treated, cracked teeth can lead to the death of the nerve, and an abscess might grow.&#8221; An abscess is full of pus and bacteria, allowing bacteria to travel through various tracts to the body upon breaking open.</p>\r\n<h3>Gum and Periodontal Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Gum disease is the leading cause of tooth decay, tooth loss, and, in severe cases, periodontal disease. Gum and periodontal disease, characterized by sensitive and inflamed gums, are linked to decay, resulting in tooth and bone loss when left untreated. Complete health dentists can detect early signs of gum disease and treat patients before it progresses to periodontal disease or general health conditions that are harder or less likely to treat.</p>\r\n<h3>Oral Cancers</h3>\r\n<p>Complete health dentists screen for oral cancer during routine dental visits in an attempt to find lesions and signs of cancer or precancer symptoms. According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, 35,000 Americans will be diagnosed with oral cancer each year. Identifying sores, cysts, lesions, and other conditions of cancer early greatly aids in recovery benefits.</p>\r\n<h2>Medical Conditions That Can Be Detected</h2>\r\n<p>Many oral and systemic conditions and diseases coincide, simultaneously affecting one another. Complete health dentists are aware of these conditions and the signs that would appear in the mouth, face, neck, or throat with such conditions. At the same time, oral conditions that can affect or cause general health conditions are also apparent and discussed to prevent or treat other conditions.</p>\r\n<h3>Heart Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Poor oral health increases the risk of bacteria and infection entering the bloodstream, particularly affecting patients with artificial heart valves. The Mayo Clinic found that &#8220;heart disease, clogged arteries, and stroke might be linked to the inflammation and infections that oral bacteria can cause.&#8221; Periodontal disease, a severe form of gum disease, is associated with an increased risk of developing a heart condition.</p>\r\n<h3>Diabetes</h3>\r\n<p>Diabetes is another common condition that both affects and is affected by gum disease. The Mayo Clinic suggests, &#8220;by reducing the body&#8217;s resistance to infection, diabetes puts your gums at risk.” Gum and periodontal care can help manage diabetes while maintaining stability in blood sugar can also help mitigate gum and periodontal disease.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Conditions Affected by Oral Health:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Endocarditis</li>\r\n\t<li>Pregnancy: premature birth and low birth rate</li>\r\n\t<li>Thyroid</li>\r\n\t<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Medications That Affect Oral Health</h2>\r\n<p>Through extensive research, clinical trials, and experience, researchers have found that many medications for various health conditions affect patients’ oral health. Therefore, complete health dentists have a record of each patient’s medical history along with a list of all medications they have taken or are currently taking. They can also alter certain medications to fit the patient&#8217;s needs and help curb their symptoms or side effects while offering guidance in navigating general health conditions during dental treatment.</p>\r\n<p>A few of the most common medications that affect the mouth include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cancer medications</li>\r\n\t<li>Diabetes medications</li>\r\n\t<li>Regulatory medicines (i.e., cardiovascular or thyroid)</li>\r\n\t<li>Antidepressants</li>\r\n\t<li>High blood pressure medication</li>\r\n\t<li>Pain relievers and sedatives</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>NextLevel Practice Partnership</h2>\r\n<p>Complete health dentistry not only changed the way in which dentists view and treat patients, it also gave health professionals and patients across the board an enhanced idea of the extent to which dental and general health are connected. It allows patients to better care for themselves and dentists to provide better dialogue in terms of how conditions are being affected and the prevention or treatments required. Treating patients comprehensively also enables good patient-doctor rapport and builds stronger communication, which helps treat patients more accurately.</p>\r\n<p>Many dentists and practices are aware of the oral-systemic health connection and interested in converting their practice but may not know how to start. With its growing popularity, we have extended our knowledge and expertise about complete health dentistry through our collaboration with NextLevel Practice (NLP), led by visionary Gary Kadi.

If you are like many business owners, you<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/importance-of-building-in-feedback/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>To enable comments or not to enable comments, that is the question. If you are like many business owners, you fear that by adding a comment section to your blog or website, you are inadvertently inviting negative feedback. Negative feedback, especially when shared in such a public way, can adversely affect visitors’ perceptions of your practice or brand. Add to this the fact that enabling comments is time-consuming, as commenters often expect responses, and that it requires moderation to deter junk commenters, you may feel that the answer is obvious: Keep the comments off. However, at Doctor Genius, we encourage you to do the opposite.</p>\r\n<h2>Reasons to incorporate a comment section into your site design</h2>\r\n<p>The marketing world has long been in debate over the whys and why-nots of a comments section on a blog. You can check out the for- and against- arguments on <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://optinmonster.com/to-allow-blog-comments-or-not-heres-what-the-data-shows/\">Optinmonster</a>, but we want to share our thoughts with you below.</p>\r\n<h3>Build a network</h3>\r\n<p>Content marketing serves three major purposes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>To help your site gain rankings</li>\r\n\t<li>To establish your practice as an authoritative presence</li>\r\n\t<li>To build relationships with current and potential patients</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Allowing feedback enables you to do the third by giving you a way to connect with your followers, to develop relationships based on mutual interests and respect, and to turn an otherwise static piece of content in a living conversation. In short, it allows you to build a network.</p>\r\n<h3>Encourage constructive criticism</h3>\r\n<p>You create content for your audience members, so allow them to make suggestions. Turn the comments section on to encourage feedback regarding an article’s content and to invite ideas for improvement and future topics. This type of constructive criticism gives you a tangible sense of how your audience responds to your content, as well as ways you can improve it so that it resonates positively with the intended recipients.</p>\r\n<h3>Contribute to your SEO</h3>\r\n<p>Many website owners who turn off the comments section fail to take into consideration the SEO value it offers. While a handful of comments is unlikely to make a difference for any given page’s rankings, dozens to hundreds of comments can. How? The reason is two-fold.</p>\r\n<p>First, comments contribute to page length. Second, more words on a page gives it an opportunity to rank for more keywords. To determine whether this contributed to increased search traffic, <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/ranking-factors/\">Neil Patel</a> conducted an in-depth study. He found two things to be true.</p>\r\n<p>The first was that, on a comments section that added nearly 4,000 words to a page, approximately 26% of keywords that ranked in Google came from the comments section. The second was that the section garnered approximately 16% of the article’s traffic. Though incorporating feedback into your site design may make more work for you, the results can be well worth it.</p>\r\n<h2>The smart way to enable comments</h2>\r\n<p>A section that encourages feedback can help in multiple other ways, such as keeping your <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-have-a-live-site/\">site live</a>, encouraging customer loyalty, and serving as social proof. Of course, there are the drawbacks to consider, but those become a moot point when you have a dedicated account manager moderating comments, responding to feedback, and, of course, dealing with the back-end issues. To partner with such an account manager, call Doctor Genius at <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">1-877-477-2311</a> today.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.
