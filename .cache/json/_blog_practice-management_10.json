If you have seen <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\" target=\"_blank\">Johns Hopkins University’s heat map of coronavirus COVID-19 global cases,</a> you may be feeling lost and confused about interpreting the actual and logarithmic data, along with the daily cases reported. The high numbers of confirmed cases and deaths may seem intimidating, but what do they really mean in the grand scheme of things?</p> \r\n<h2>Actual vs. Logarithmic Data</h2>\r\n<p>On the Johns Hopkins University graph for actual data, data is spaced out by every 20,000 cases. In other words, the chart is spaced out linearly and evenly. This is known as an arithmetic graph, where equal distances represent equal amounts. Most people are most familiar with this type of chart because of its straightforward nature.</p>\r\n<p>The JHU graph for logarithmic data, however, spaces out data from 10 to 1,000 to 100,000. Instead of representing equal amounts, equal distances represent equal rates. In this case, each distance represents 10%. This makes it more useful in comparing rates of change.</p>\r\n<h2>Daily Rates of COVID-19 Growth</h2>\r\n<p>It would be easy to interpret the JHU graph for actual data as proof that the daily rates of (1) novel coronavirus growth outside of mainland China and (2) total recovered worldwide have been skyrocketing since February. Looking at this graph may be disheartening, as it seems to indicate an unstoppable daily uptick in novel coronavirus cases.</p>\r\n<p>However, the logarithmic data shows us that the daily growth rates of COVID-19 outside of mainland China are <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-data-do-not-support-global-alarmism-by-anatole-kaletsky-2020-03\" target=\"_blank\">actually slowing down.</a></p>\r\n<h2>Interpreting COVID-19 Maps</h2>\r\n<p>Some may also find it panic-inducing to look at JHU’s map. It is crucial to remember that the data presented does not give viewers an idea of the number of cases relative to the population. In other words, the map is using actual data. By failing to list population numbers and focusing only on COVID-19-related statistics, the map may render viewers unable to establish a baseline for comparison.</p>\r\n<p>JHU’s map partially compensates for this by implementing proportional symbols in marking each region, meaning larger circles represent larger numbers of cumulative confirmed cases. Thus, viewers may be able to see which countries are more affected than others — though not proportionately so.</p>\r\n<h2>Significance of Current Data</h2>\r\n<p>The actual data suggests that cases exploded in mainland China from mid-January to early February before finally beginning to flatten out in mid-February. Additionally, the graph indicates that the total recovery rate has been on the rise. Logarithmic data confirms both of these assumptions while simultaneously showing that recovery rates may be leveling out — likely correlated with the overall slowing of new COVID-19 diagnoses.</p>\r\n<p>All of this indicates that flattening the curve is still very possible, provided individuals <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/\" target=\"_blank\">stick to necessary precautions like social distancing.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the high numbers reported in COVID-19 statistics may be intimidating, they must be taken in context. Understanding how to correctly interpret the data on COVID-19 is imperative in reducing sensationalism and panic. Staying calm and keeping a clear head can help aid you in taking the preventative steps needed to keep both yourself and those around you safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

With its widespread nature, governments and organizations<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/managing-loans-amid-coronavirus/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The World Health Organization announced Wednesday that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814474930/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says\" target=\"_blank\">coronavirus (COVID-19) is officially a pandemic</a>. With its widespread nature, governments and organizations are implementing protective measures. Many are restricting their travel, working from home, and avoiding large groups of people. These things, and other factors, are presenting businesses with a variety of challenges.</p>\r\n<p>One question many business owners are asking themselves is, “How will I be able to manage my business’s finances during this time?” Managing loans or just keeping a business afloat during a lull or shutdown period brought on by COVID-19 can be challenging and confusing. Fortunately, there are some ways businesses can plan and navigate this turbulent environment.</p>\r\n<h2>Common Issues Businesses May Encounter</h2>\r\n<p>COVID-19 has unfortunately presented businesses with a list of potential problems. While it is important not to panic, it is just as important to be aware of some of the possible factors. Access to capital may be the biggest concern for businesses. Things like payroll and inventory are affected by market fluctuations, so businesses should prepare by assessing their access options as soon as possible so that they can adjust accordingly. Fortunately, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has rolled out an assistance plan for small businesses affected by COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>There are additional factors to consider. These include workforce capacity, employee wellbeing, inventory, supply chain, insurance coverage issues, changing market demand, marketing, and cleanup. It is critical to contact insurance providers and suppliers to get a read on the situation. Additionally, business owners and managers should be <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html\" target=\"_blank\">developing contingency plans</a> for the factors above, whether the overall situation becomes worse, stays the same, or starts to improve. Doing so will mitigate the collateral damage leveed on your business by the virus.</p>\r\n<h2>Decreasing Revenue With Oncoming Loan Payments and Other Expenses</h2>\r\n<p>A significant potential challenge for companies is losing business while still having to make payments on loans, rent, and other expenses. While this may seem like an insurmountable situation at first, there are steps people can take to mitigate some of the damage to their business.</p>\r\n<h3>FDIC and Banks</h3>\r\n<p>On March 9, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) released <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/coronavirus/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">a statement</a> that they are working with federal and state banking agencies to help customers who are affected by COVID-19. Additionally, the FDIC stated that regulatory agencies are encouraging financial institutions to work with customers. This is potentially good news for those businesses facing less revenue and mounting payments.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, companies can reach out to their issuers, and inquire if they may be willing to adjust their existing payment plan. Also, if a business has an emergency savings fund, it may need to start dipping into it until it resolves payment issues.</p>\r\n<h3>The White House and SBA Assistance</h3>\r\n<p>President Trump has signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-taken-unprecedented-steps-respond-coronavirus-protect-health-safety-americans/\" target=\"_blank\">economic assistance package</a> into effect to help assist both businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. This comes as one of the numerous steps the federal government has recently taken to deal with the mounting situation in America.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the federal government has instructed the SBA to supply affordable loans that will assist businesses and workers affected by the outbreak. Congress is in talks to fund the program with an additional $50 billion. The SBA has also provided <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/page/guidance-businesses-employers-plan-respond-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19#section-header-4\" target=\"_blank\">resources and guidance for businesses</a> on their website.</p>\r\n<p>As the situation develops, so too may the potential challenges for businesses. Owners and workers can better navigate these hurdles by adopting a proactive approach, by utilizing government assistance, and by continually staying informed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have provided href=&#8221;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html&#8221;_blank&#8221;>interim guidance for businesses and workers during the COVID-19 outbreak</a> on their website.</p>\r\n\r\n<b><p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

Many Americans are unsure how coronavirus&#8217;<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/shutting-down-the-office-due-to-covid-19/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>The spread of COVID-19, also known as coronavirus, has had tensions running high worldwide. Many Americans are unsure how coronavirus&#8217; new designation as a pandemic will affect the way they conduct business. It is important to know what to expect and have a plan in place in case you are placed on lockdown. You should also know what to do if you need to work from home.</p>\r\n<h3>Understanding Lockdowns</h3>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/global/emergency-lockdown\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</a> (NIH), lockdown procedures are necessary when an immediate threat presents itself to building occupants. During these instances, it becomes more dangerous for occupants to leave the building than it is for them to stay in secured areas. With the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens may be placed under lockdown if disease-causing contaminants have been released into the environment.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21172390/italy-lockdown-coronavirus-expansion-lombardy\" target=\"_blank\">entire country of Italy is on lockdown</a> to prevent further spread of coronavirus. Consequently, Italian citizens are not allowed to assemble in public or do anything other than stay at home.</p>\r\n<h3>Lockdown Response Activities</h3>\r\n<p>The number one thing to do during a lockdown is to stay calm, as panicking will only make things worse. If placed under lockdown, individuals should secure themselves at home as soon as possible. They should not leave until directed otherwise by emergency personnel, as doing so will increase the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Follow any directions given by the relevant authorities until and after being given the all-clear.</p>\r\n<h3>Taking Your Practice Remote</h3>\r\n<p>Many business owners may want to take their practice remote in anticipation of a lockdown. Doing so seamlessly involves time and planning. According to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90475330/8-strategies-to-set-up-remote-work-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">a CEO writing for Fast Company</a>, it all &#8220;starts from the top.&#8221; In other words, business owners should lead by example, making themselves present and available on various online tools and channels.</p>\r\n<p>Since there is less non-verbal communication involved in remote work, it is crucial to reinforce the company&#8217;s missions and expectations. At the same time, creating and promoting a digital company culture is critical. To do so, business owners must choose the right tools (such as Slack or Google Hangouts) and keep them in constant use.</p>\r\n<p>Following the example of The United States Office of Personnel Management brought up in an article by The Washington Post, another option is to “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-now-wants-hundreds-of-thousands-of-federal-workers-to-be-ready-to-telework-to-limit-coronavirus-spread/2020/03/10/ea284a12-620b-11ea-b3fc-7841686c5c57_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">issue ­laptops and grant access to computer networks.</a>&#8220;</p>\r\n<h3>Remote Work Strategies for Employees</h3>\r\n<p>Of course, employees should also be aware of the new expectations they will be accountable for while working in a remote work environment. Try to prepare for working from home as soon as possible. This involves taking note of any software, information, bookmarks, phone numbers, and anything else that might be necessary to carry out essential job duties.</p>\r\n<p>Next, set up a designated, separate workspace at home, if possible. Many workers find this helps them strike an appropriate work-life balance. It is crucial to communicate as clearly as possible.</p>\r\n<p>Workers should set up a culture of responsiveness and keep colleagues updated on any deadlines or progress they have made throughout the day. Additionally, those who need to take care of pets or children should be transparent about their schedule.\r\n\r\n<h3>Work Goes On</h3>\r\n<p>With proper planning, you can ensure that your business has a seamless transition into working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can lessen your chances of contracting the coronavirus by taking preventive measures and being prepared for a lockdown. Though feelings of fear and anxiety are natural, it is crucial to stay calm.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

You may be asking yourself what you should do to prepare for COVID-19. There are many things to consider in the wake of a pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>Having a plan in place may assuage any anxieties you have about contracting the virus and protecting yourself from it.</p>\r\n<h3>Consider Your Household</h3>\r\n<p>All household members should consult with each other to determine what will be done if there is an outbreak in the community. Some populations are more at risk for suffering complications from coronavirus than others. According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/get-your-household-ready-for-COVID-19.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), vulnerable groups include older adults and those with chronic health problems.</p>\r\n<p>If you or a loved one falls into one of these categories, please consult with a healthcare professional for guidelines one how to reduce the chances of infection.</p>\r\n<h3>Food to Stock Up On</h3>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/pandemic\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Homeland Security</a>, individuals should store a two-week supply of water and food before a pandemic strikes. Individuals can shop for the same foods they normally would, provided they are nutritious and do not have a short shelf-life. Frozen fruits and vegetables are best, as are nutritious non-perishables.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that there is an adequate supply of any needed prescription drugs. Try to get a 30-day supply, if possible. Other health supplies (like nonprescription drugs, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins) should also be sufficiently stocked.</p>\r\n<img src=\"/blogimg/how-to-prepare-for-corvid-inline.jpg\" alt=\"How should I prepare for the Coronavirus?\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Supplies You Need</h3>\r\n<p>Though it is essential to stock up on needed supplies in case of emergency, individuals should also keep in mind that hoarding is not the answer. Across the globe, some stores have been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/health/toilet-paper-shortages-novel-coronavirus-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">undergoing a notorious shortage of toilet paper</a> due to the coronavirus crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s recommendation is that people have enough supplies to last them for two weeks at home. Prioritize basic toiletries and cleaning supplies, along with any needed supplies for children or pets. &#8220;Panic buying&#8221; may lead to a shortage of supplies for others, thus increasing a community&#8217;s overall vulnerability.</p>\r\n<h3>The Real Threat of COVID-19</h3>\r\n<p>COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Still, the organization is optimistic that the virus can be &#8220;suppressed and controlled&#8221; with the proper planning and investment of resources. We do not yet know how severe the illness can be.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/health-information/coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">National Institutes of Health</a> states that &#8220;For the majority of people, the immediate risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low.&#8221;</a></p>\r\n<p>Taking the right preventive measures and having a plan in place, however, may help lessen any personal impact.</p>\r\n<h3>Preparation Can Be Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>Just hearing the word &#8220;pandemic&#8221; can be intimidating. Planning for a potential quarantine can be a proactive way to lessen any feelings of fear and lessen your chances of contracting the disease. It is important to remember that one individual&#8217;s actions may help protect an entire community.</p>\r\n<p>Taking preventive measures may also help you feel less stressed about potentially catching coronavirus.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

The question is no longer &#8220;will it hit your neighborhood.&#8221; Now, you should be asking &#8220;by when.&#8221; Like many others, you would probably like to know what to do when handling day-to-day situations to avoid infection. </p>\r\n<p>Among an onslaught of questions we hear, one that appears often is whether it is safe to even go outside. Here are a few tips other medical professionals are offering in regard to this question.</p>\r\n<h3>Preventing the Illness</h3>\r\n<p>It is important to note that during an outbreak of COVID-19, the main focus of a lockdown is to slow the spread of it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, states that <a href= \"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fprevention-treatment.html\" target=\" _blank\">COVID-19 is spread</a> &#8220;Between people who are in close contact with one another,&#8221; and &#8220;Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&#8221;\r\nThe CDC adds that many places where a large number of people gather may shut down during a lockdown. This can include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"browser-default\">\r\n<li>Community centers</li>\r\n<li>Schools</li>\r\n<li>Offices or places of work</li>\r\n<li>Movie theaters</li>\r\n<li>Large events/gatherings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img src=\"/blogimg/exercise-caution-corvid-inline.jpg\" alt=\"Be careful in large crowds or parks\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1987\" />\r\n\r\n<p>So, while going outside will not immediately mean a person contracts COVID-19, that does not mean that people should spend too much time outside. In fact, limiting one&#8217;s time outside can help decrease the risk of contracting COVID-19 from another person. Unless there is a national warning to remain indoors put into effect, people can go outside when absolutely necessary.</p>\r\n<h3>Steps to Take When Outside</h3>\r\n<p>Even though people are able to go outside, there are precautionary steps people can take to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p><b>Frequently Wash Hands with Soap and Water</b></p>\r\nThe <a href= \"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/controlprevention.html\" target=\" _blank\">United States Department of Labor</a> and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration gives details on controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the office space. The Department of Labor states that regardless of specific exposure risks, it is crucial to &#8220;Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>This advice not only applies to employees in the workspace but to people of all ages in any setting. It is crucial to wash the hands and decrease the risk of contracting the condition.</p>\r\n<p><b>Avoid sharing food or drinks</b></p>\r\n<p>Whether someone is going out for a meal or with friends, do not share food or drinks. The CDC states that &#8220;Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms.&#8221; People who do not display signs of COVID-19 can still be contagious. Avoid sharing food and drinks to decrease the chance of spreading it.</p>\r\n<p><b>Clean surfaces when in public</b></p>\r\n<p>Before using a surface, such as a table at a restaurant or bench at a park, it is crucial to keep the surfaces clean. Ensure the surface was wiped down before using it to prevent the risk of interacting with germs and potential areas that are contaminated with the virus.</p>\r\n<p><b>Avoid large community events and gatherings</b></p>\r\n<p>In many cases of a virus such as COVID-19 spreading, public gatherings and events may close down. Schools may close to prevent the risk of the virus spreading through children. Community centers, churches, movie theaters, and more may temporarily close. In the cases of colleges closing, some may have students work from home.</p>\r\n<p>Place of employment may do the same thing, choosing to have employees complete work remotely and not come into the office.</p>\r\n<h3>Seek the Information You Need</h3>\r\n<p>When it comes to your health, it is crucial to seek information from a credible source. If you have any concerns about COVID-19, reach out to your medical professional for more information. While outside, exercise caution in interaction with other people and limit the amount of time you spend outside. It is important to note that protocol for dealing with COVID-19 and going outside may change in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Review credible online sources and news stations for current updates. If you believe that you or a loved one has symptoms, contact your medical provider for instructions on treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance.

The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay. The pandemic and its aftermath will continue to cause disruptions for businesses and change consumer behavior. It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill. You can be the right dentist that meets the needs of these potential patients looking for professional care. The right digital marketing strategy will set your business apart from the competition when it matters the most. Digital marketing can help your practice adapt and grow in the aftermath of COVID-19.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We Are Here to Help </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unsure if your dental practice is ready for the digital landscape, we can help.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
