An independent consumer study from TalkTo found in 2013 that the average person spends about 13 hours per year or about 43 days on hold in a lifetime. Fortunately, the Support and Client Services team at Doctor Genius can offer the help that you need when you need it.\r\n\r\n<h3>We’re here to help you</h3>\r\n\r\nWe not only supply support to clients, but we have a team of marketing specialists, support team members and sales representatives on standby to address any issues or answer any questions that you might have. We do not rely on an automated system to solve a client’s issue and will ensure that we find the solution for your needs.\r\n\r\nWe throw away the annoying and challenging barriers that customers face when they have to speak with a machine or automated system to answer questions. In fact, American Express conducted a survey in 2011 which found that 67 percent of customers hung up out of frustration that they had to speak with a machine and not a real person.\r\n\r\nWhile our system will direct a caller to a specific department, we will be there to speak with the client as soon as we are able and solve their problem. We provide constant communication in order for you to get the most out of your website and our services. We also strive to offer quality content on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n<h3>A high caliber of custom content</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Untitled-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-586\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Untitled-2.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Untitled-2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p>Our support team is also available to communicate with clients for any corrections or changes the client wants to make.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAlong with our constant communication and strong support, we also provide clients with quality custom content for their website.

In order for a client to order the product, contact customer service, inter-office communication, schedule an appointment, you need a phone number. For a professional medical practice, having a call tracking number helps with much more than just scheduling appointments. People are more likely to click call a tracking number online than email the professional.\r\n\r\n<h3>More than just a means of tracking the number of calls</h3>\r\n\r\nIn a 2014 study by Google, the results show that 78 percent of consumers think the local address in an ad is important and 77 percent think displaying a phone number is important. Possible patients want to feel they are contacting a service that will not cheat them out of quality. If patients find it difficult to contact a practice, then they will be more inclined to seek services elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe can help professionals utilize what are known as “trust signals” such as a phone number, address, online reviews and more to help show patients that the practice is real and trustworthy. However, a medical professional may not enjoy the idea of having his or her personal phone as a main point of contact for patients. A call tracking number will be available for future patients and will help to track calls.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:300px; border-left:3px solid #666666; margin-center:1px;padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p>In the same Google study, 70 percent of participants prefer a call button on a website when using their smartphone.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nIt is important to listen to what consumers enjoy or find easiest to use in communication. Patients may seek a different practice than their current one if it is too difficult to contact. At Doctor Genius, we can help utilize call tracking and determine the most effective means of communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22b-The-Study-Call-Tracking.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-599\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22b-The-Study-Call-Tracking.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22b-The-Study-Call-Tracking-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Using call tracking to help you</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we use call tracking to:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Track the number of calls a patient is getting</li>\r\n \t<li>Help the professional differentiate between old and new clients before picking up the phone</li>\r\n \t<li>Create effective tools such as a calling button on the website for easy-smartphone use access</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe understand how to utilize computer, tablet and smartphone platforms to provide the proper view of a client’s website. In the same Google study, 70 percent of participants prefer a call button on a website when using their smartphone. At Doctor Genius, we can customize the call button and your website with the patient in mind. We will ensure the website is easy to navigate and has all of the mechanics to ensure the patient can directly contact the practice to schedule an appointment if necessary.\r\n\r\nWe also offer our services in a variety of packages to provide potential clients with multiple options and services. We will spend the time to take all information into account before we determine which plan can most effectively bring in new patients.  If you are interested in Doctor Genius or have questions about our services, do not hesitate to call us at 877-477-2311.\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.

Social media is becoming an effective tool for professionals of any field to reach clients.  However, professionals need the social media know-how to navigate the system and gain more patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A strong presence in social media</h3>\r\nFrom Pinterest to Twitter, dental professionals are able to interact with patients and share information about their services online. Social media can give professionals an opportunity to offer their services, promotions and information to potential patients with the click of a button. Twitter is one such platform that allows for quick bits of information.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, the PEW Research Center found in a group of 1,520 adults, 79 percent used Facebook as their main social media platform. Meanwhile, CNN writes on money.cnn.com that Facebook is climbing toward 2 billion active users as of the end of 2016. With the variety of content that people post on any social media platform, there are a variety of tools that people use online. One such tool is known as the hashtag that helps people find the post more easily than before.\r\n\r\nIn another study of the PEW Research Center, they explain that “The hashtag symbol (#) is used before keywords to categorize tweets and helps facilitate searches within Twitter.” By using the hashtag symbol, professionals can help patients find a specific post about dental care. Examples can include #DentalCheckups or #ProfessionalTeethCleaning. The PEW Research Center also finds that “Clicking on a hashtag will show all the tweets in a category.”\r\n\r\nTwitter is beneficial for a quick and small post that appeals to patients who do not need or want a lot of information. However, attaching any word to a hashtag symbol does not guarantee that more people will read the post.\r\n<h3>Let Doctor Genius enhance your practice</h3>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://doctorgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-548\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag.jpg 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21b-The-Study-Hashtag-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" />\r\n\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we understand the mechanics of social media, utilizing Facebook and Twitter to promote a client’s practice. While Facebook is extremely popular, people will frequent other platforms online for various reasons. The PEW Research Center also found that in 2011, around 57 percent of all tweets from The Daily Caller and 21 percent of all tweets from the Washington Post used the hashtag symbol.\r\n\r\nWhile the hashtag symbol can be effective, we will not flood every single tweet, Facebook post or comment with hashtags. We have a team of professionals who can help create, customize and continually monitor online content to ensure that our clients get quality service. Social media has more tools and methods for promoting one’s practice to potential patients. We strive to help our clients’ Facebook pages appear on other people’s feeds, while also reaching out on Twitter.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in more information or in seeking our services, feel free to give us a call. #Specializedonlinecontent\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dg-section\">\r\n<h3>Doctor Genius</h3>\r\nAt Doctor Genius, we work with clients to expand their <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/demo/\">private practice</a> by helping them reach, engage and convert consumers into new patients.
