The thrill that comes with the prospect of expanding one’s reach and attracting new patients or clients is shadowed by the pressure to get everything, from the design to the navigation to the content, just right. If you can relate to this, you may be tempted to sit back, relax, and watch your site do its work once you hit “Publish.” We recommend against doing this, as your website will not work for you — at least not very well — without some tender loving care.</p>\r\n<h2>How to increase the effectiveness of your website</h2>\r\n<p>To maximize the effectiveness of your website, you need to keep it active. A live site is one that is continually updated, maintained, and refined. To keep your website from decaying, create a live site checklist. Below are four items to add to it.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Refresh your content</h3>\r\n<p>Content drives traffic to your website and engages visitors. However, if it is not written for your audience, contains errors, or lacks the appropriate keywords, you risk driving visitors away: if you attract them at all.</p>\r\n<p>After you launch your site, wait a couple of days and then go back to review your content with a fresh eye. Overtime, tweak it so that it is in line with your brand’s voice and speaks directly to your target market. Optimize it for search, correct any errors, and take out or edit any information that is inaccurate or no longer relevant. Go through <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\">old blogs</a> that were successful, looking for what worked and what didn&#8217;t work on ranking reports. At this point, you can decide if your keywords need to be refreshed, so that future blogs are relevant or if you should elaborate on what worked well. For webpages, after enough time has elapsed, you may need to redo the page altogether. By auditing your content regularly, you can ensure it stays fresh and effective.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Add new content</h3>\r\n<p>Google prioritizes new, pertinent content over the stale, out-of-date subject matter. This is evident by its <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/freshness-update/#close\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/freshness-update/#close\">2016 “Freshness” algorithm</a>, which places a greater emphasis on the recentness of content than it ever has before. Not only does Google appreciate new content, but so, too, does your audience.</p>\r\n<p>New content in the form of blogs, landing pages, videos, infographics, white papers, and the like helps you to increase audience retention, establish trust, build authority, and, ultimately, encourage conversions. For these reasons, and for ranking purposes, one of the first things you should do after launching your website is to build a content marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Update your imagery</h3>\r\n<p>When people return to your site, it is because they like what they saw before and want to see what new and exciting things you have to offer. Changes, no matter how slight (such as a new banner or an updated team picture), can appease return visitors and entice them to visit again soon.</p>\r\n<p>New imagery can also give your rankings a boost. By using alt text, captions, image sitemaps, and image structured data, you can make your imagery searchable, ensuring that each page of content pulls double duty.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Check usability</h3>\r\n<p>Several factors affect usability, including site speed, navigation, security and mobility. Perform a complete audit of your site across multiple different devices and platforms to ensure it performs optimally on each. If you discover any shortcomings or errors, such as 404s or slow load time, fix them to ensure a smooth user experience.   </p>\r\n<h2>See how our marketing solutions can keep your site live</h2>\r\n<p>At Doctor Genius, we have the tools, talent, and resources to help your business thrive online.

When someone browses the web for a relevant practitioner, you not only want your company&#8217;s webpage to rank high on search results, but you also want that click to convert into an appointment. How do you build trust using your website? Discover a few ways regular blog posts may accomplish this, and more, for your practice.</p>\r\n<h2>Blog posts build a connection</h2>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/03/28/building-trust-how-blogging-can-improve-customer-relationships/#1a92adf54eeb\">Forbes.com</a>, blog posts help establish a connection between readers and your practice. When your content is well written and provides accurate information in a relatable way, readers will respond. Creating informative posts bridges the gap between potential customers and your practice. Adding posts regularly builds your presence in the Google metrics and boosts your live site.</p>\r\n<h2>Successful blogs contain these elements</h2>\r\n<p>At DG, we know what it takes to boost your blog. By utilizing SEO-friendly techniques, our content develops an authoritative voice to elevate your practice in search results. Google uses the E-A-T system (Expertise, Authority, and Trust) to rank the trustworthiness of a brand or website. The more blogs that utilize certain measures, the higher the hits in this search metric. Delve into how these elements may yield new patients for your practice.</p>\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<p>Every blog post should contain factual information. Citing outside sources via backlinks is one way to ensure the reader knows the claims made are accurate. Having verifiable sources that support the content in your blog is crucial to building the trust required to elevate your blog and business. If you are successful in establishing your authority, you may find other websites that link to your posts. When another webpage does this, it increases the visibility of your own through backlinking.</p>\r\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\r\n<p>SEO writing revolves around using keywords that search engines pick up when users enter them in the search box. Using keywords effectively in blog posts increases the likelihood of a company&#8217;s page showing up in results. Knowing the appropriate keywords to utilize when optimizing hits is an integral part of digital marketing.</p>\r\n<h3>Internal linking</h3>\r\n<p>When creating new material, you have the opportunity to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/why-keeping-old-blogs-matters/\">promote older posts</a>. Blogs remain intact on the practice&#8217;s page until deleted. If there is a shortage of ideas for new material, refresh older posts. Since the medical community is continually changing, you may update a previous post with new science. Instead of deleting the previous post, link it to the new. This is another effective way to increase views and trust for your business.</p>\r\n<h2>The time to capture business is now</h2>\r\n<p>Getting new patients should no longer depend only on referrals. Take control of your marketing through the creation of regular blog posts. Our team at Doctor Genius is standing by to answer your questions and get you started. We want to learn all we can about your needs so we can suggest the perfect package to fill them. <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">Give our team a call</a> and let us help grow your practice to its full potential. </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

While certain events might not be on people&#8217;s radar, most know that marriage constitutes a life event. A patient getting married who is satisfied with the current benefits program can be more likely to remain enrolled. Conversely, those who are dissatisfied may see an opportunity to drop their coverage.</p>\r\n<h2>Increasing employee satisfaction with benefits</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ways to create a positive patient experience for clients so a life event like marriage is a reason for them to increase current coverage rather than leave.</p>\r\n<h3>Provide multiple channels for connection</h3>\r\n<p>Traditionally, patients are reminded about yearly examinations or upcoming appointments with a flyer in their mailbox or a phone call. A reminder about an open enrollment period or life event from a benefits provider can also jog their memory. In addition to these methods, it can be helpful to send out notifications through text messages or emails. While this usually requires client consent, it can be more effective not only in getting patients to keep their appointments but also in helping them have a positive experience.</p>\r\n<p>You may also want to consider allowing patients to make or change appointments through a portal available on the company website. This can encourage clients to take control of their health care and make scheduling their responsibility. </p>\r\n<h3>Encourage staff interaction </h3>\r\n<p>Patients who feel supported by every staff member they come into contact with can be more likely to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207234/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207234/\">feel valued as a client</a>. Each time an employee walks by patients without smiling or acknowledging them in some way, patients may feel less like a person and more like a case number. When all staff members make patient care a top priority, it can encourage not only patient loyalty but also an increased sense of urgency regarding personal health care. Clients who feel valued by health care providers can be more likely to not only be pleased with their benefits package but also to recommend remaining with their current providers to a new spouse.   </p>\r\n<h3>Offer affordable payment plans</h3>\r\n<p>It is unrealistic to think all treatments can be offered at affordable rates. However, expecting clients to pay a premium out of pocket for treatment can result in fewer patients agreeing to certain procedures. The following are options for payment that patients often prefer:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Financing</li>\r\n\t<li>Monthly installment payments made directly to the medical practice</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduced cost for paying the total upfront with <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/paying-medical-bills-with-no-health-insurance-2385907\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/paying-medical-bills-with-no-health-insurance-2385907\">cash</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Making both elective and necessary treatments more affordable can encourage patients to see health care as a more affordable option. </p>\r\n<h2>Discover more ways to keep clients during qualifying events</h2>\r\n<p>Sometimes, increasing client retention can be accomplished by <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/plans\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/plans\">restructuring your website</a> to make it more attractive and user-friendly.
