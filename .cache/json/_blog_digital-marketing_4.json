There is a good chance that your targeted audience may first interact with your brand on a social media platform before ever encountering your website. Having a strong strategy will allow you to build brand awareness, create good organic posts, and convert qualified leads.</p>\r\n<h2>Setting up Your Social Media Accounts for Success</h2>\r\n<p>Now is a great time to get started if your business does not have any social media accounts yet. Take time to evaluate which platforms may be the most beneficial for your company, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>\r\n<h3>Understand the Different Social Platforms</h3>\r\n<p>Having a general understanding of the various social platforms, the type of content, and the audience they attract can help you set up your accounts effectively. For example, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/\">Instagram statistics</a> show the site is most popular among younger adults aged 18 to 34. On the other hand. LinkedIn&#8217;s primary users are between the ages of 46 and 55 years old.</p>\r\n<h3>Create a Brand Identity</h3>\r\n<p>Your office branding should be consistent everywhere people may interact with it. If your company has designed a logo, this image should appear on your signs, marketing collateral, company website, and social media platforms.</p>\r\n<h3>Identify Your Goals</h3>\r\n<p>Run the numbers to evaluate where your company currently is at versus where you need it to be. If your office is already active on social media, identify which areas you need to improve on and focus on those.  Investing in building brand awareness is important to do before directing your efforts towards lead generation and conversions.</p>\r\n<h3>Balance Paid and Organic Content</h3>\r\n<p>When using social media, businesses have two main tools to reach people and direct them towards a specific action: paid advertisements and organic content. Your office does not have to have a large following to reach your intended audience, as most sites do not post your ads on your account. Using paid ads can help you get page likes and present your brand to people who fit your target demographic.</p>\r\n<p>Organic content includes posts on your page. Keep up on posting and engage with your audience to establish your brand and draw potential patients to your office. When done correctly, this can help boost your website’s SEO ranking by encouraging backlinking to highly shared content and increasing the number of branded searches on search engines from people who interact with your office on social media.</p>\r\n<p>Build Brand Awareness and Boost SEO With Social Media</p>\r\n<p>In today’s digital world, social media is a necessary aspect of a business.

While you may have<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/marketing-funnel-for-patients/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>In general, the marketing funnel describes the process of generating leads and converting them into customers. While you may have a clear idea of what this progression looks like from the perspective of a medical practitioner, visualizing the funnel from the viewpoint of the patient can help you understand why each step in the process is essential and focus on strategies that your target audience is more likely to respond to.</p>\r\n<h2>The stages of the marketing funnel</h2>\r\n<p>There are several different representations used to explain the steps of the marketing funnel, which can range from three to eight stages or more. However, no matter the number or label used, the process typically covers awareness, consideration, and purchase. Each of these steps affects the patient experience in a unique way and depends on the other to guide the individual towards making a purchase.</p>\r\n<h3>Awareness</h3>\r\n<p>The first part of the marketing funnel, often called lead generation from an advertiser’s point of view, is the moment when the patient first becomes aware of your medical practice and services. There are several ways a person can come to this step, including exposure through viewing an advertisement placed on a social media site, seeing your practice on the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/\">search engine ranking page</a> after searching for a related keyword such as “family dentist near Roseville,” or hearing about your practice from a friend or family member. While there is much more that goes in advertising and targeting from your end as the medical practitioner or owner of a medical office, the introduction should feel natural and simple to the patient.</p>\r\n<h3>Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>After patients become aware of your brand, they transition into the consideration stage. For people who do not connect with your practice or are not in need of the services you offer, the interaction may end here. For those who are part of your target audience or within your scope of influence, this step is critical for securing a conversion.</p>\r\n<p>The patient wants to know that you offer the needed services, have a good reputation, and are qualified to do the job at hand. While some patients may be ready to employ your services quickly, others may need more time in the consideration stage. These individuals may explore your website for reviews and testimonials, browse through any <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/professional-content-writing-at-doctor-genius/\">educational content on your site</a>, search for your educational background and areas of expertise, or ask questions and engage with your office to determine if it is a good fit.</p>\r\n<h3>Purchase</h3>\r\n<p>Next, the patient makes the choice to call your office and sent up an initial appointment. Even after deciding to get your services, however, patients may hesitate or forget to follow through. Automated email reminders, calls from a staff member, free consultation offers, or invitations to a special webinar can all help guide them to finalizing the appointment.</p>\r\n<h2>Let us help you master the marketing funnel</h2>\r\n<p>Knowing how to effectively guide potential patients through the marketing funnel takes significant expertise and practice.

The primary goal of your website is not only to get people to see it but also to get them to choose your clinic over others. Converting those views into clients takes a little more effort in this ultra-competitive business. Walking through a conversion funnel allow you to see how page views become in-person appointments by following a user&#8217;s path from website visits through conversion. Take a closer look at how content marketing can help drive traffic through the proper funnels and straight to your front door.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding the stages of the funnel</h2>\r\n<p>The term conversion funnel describes the way people go from browsing the web to becoming your clients. It maps out the path people take from curiosity to appointments to improve your website&#8217;s chances of conversions in the future. There are three basic stages to a funnel:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> This is the first interaction a potential client has with your practice. It often occurs when your website is returned as a search result to a person looking up a medical term or condition.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> At this point, the user is doing some serious perusing on your practice&#8217;s site. Blog posts created to capture the greatest interest are effective ways to pull clients from the awareness stage down into the evaluation or middle funnel. Users who spend quality time in this step are genuinely interested in the services your practice provides.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Your ultimate goal is to get this window-shopper to pick up the phone or click a link to book an appointment. Getting users to drop down into this sector takes know-how of creating content and fine-tuning search analytics to answer relevant questions and earn a certain measure of authority and respect. When a client converts, it is because something about what you presented gained a measure of trust. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Using Google Analytics to transition visitors to clients</h2>\r\n<p>To create a website that maximizes the conversion funnel, it is imperative to track a client&#8217;s journey through your page so you can fine-tune for the kind of content that leads to a higher conversion rate. Using Google Analytics can give you a better understanding of your webpage&#8217;s visitors and how they interact with your content. Breaking down the information can help you refine the way traffic is driven to and through your page.</p>\r\n<h3>Who views your page?</h3>\r\n<p>The Google Analytics page provides a wealth of insight into the type of traffic your website gets. Familiarize yourself with the users who visit your website, or rather, the data associated with them. When people conduct online searches, their IP address is recorded in Google. That address allows Google to track their activity online, including any visits to your website. Google Analytics can generate a report telling you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The average times the same IP address has visited your site</li>\r\n\t<li>The amount of time the user spends engaged with your content</li>\r\n\t<li>The pages visited on your site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Understanding this information can allow you to see if the content you create correlates to repeat visits from users. By tracking user engagement, you can see how many visitors convert to in-house appointments.</p>\r\n<h3>What content gets the most traffic?</h3>\r\n<p>In the past, healthcare practices relied solely on word of mouth to gain new clients. This most often came in the form of friends or family recommending a practice to someone new. However, the internet not only allows clients to find their own providers but also allows you the opportunity to attract people you would not have gotten otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>The content you create can make or break your ability to funnel new users into becoming clients. By analyzing the page hits and time spent on your site, you can make changes to not only the way you present information, but the type of information visitors to your website are most interested in seeing. You may see a pattern emerge that takes your practice&#8217;s web presence in a different direction. For example, if you focus mostly on product awareness but see that users to your site tend to spend the most time reading about signs and symptoms of conditions, then you may want to create more content centered around this.</p>\r\n<h3>What is the bounce rate?</h3>\r\n<p>Your practice&#8217;s website probably has multiple layers and pages to offer the greatest chance that users would remain on a page and eventually schedule an appointment. When looking at Google Analytics, you may notice something called the bounce rate. As explained by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/10/30/seven-google-analytics-metrics-you-need-to-track-to-grow-your-business/#1c66e6fb6180\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/10/30/seven-google-analytics-metrics-you-need-to-track-to-grow-your-business/#1c66e6fb6180\">Forbes.com</a>, this number indicates how often someone opened a single page on your website and then left.</p>\r\n<p>There is no further data available to track these users because they failed to engage with your webpage beyond that single hit. This may be someone who followed a Google search result, such as a featured snippet, to your page, and then closed it without going any further through. A fairly high bounce rate is not necessarily a bad thing unless you notice that certain pages seem to encourage users to leave your site.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, if your homepage gets a high number of quick visits, then there is likely something that is either broken (like a link) or not engaging enough to warrant a user&#8217;s time to investigate further. Consider making your homepage more inviting and personal. Sometimes all it can take to retain a user is to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/providing-pictures-of-office/\">add photos of your office</a> and staff at work. Sometime specific articles may have higher bounce rates, either because the subject matter is not popular or perhaps the content is confusingly presented. A bounce rate analysis can help you figure out what needs fixing to retain users on your page.</p>\r\n<h2>We can provide solutions</h2>\r\n<p>If all of this talk about conversion funnels and bounce rates has your head spinning, never fear!

While it is common for businesses to pay for someone to handle the SEO of a website, this method relies entirely on free, <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/marketing-solutions/content-marketing\">organic strategies</a>. There are several essential components that affect how well a site is optimized for search engines:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keyword optimization: </strong>Choosing the right keywords and phrases and utilizing them effectively is the most important part of on-page SEO. This involves performing keyword research, considering placement of words, and creating content.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Backlinking:</strong> One way to efficiently boost your site’s reputation is by including backlinks to other trustworthy sources throughout your content. You should also manage any other sites that link to your page and consider disavowing any questionable sources.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Crawlability: </strong>A high-functioning backend is also important for SEO. Having a site map, ensuring the server is secure, and hosting pages that load quickly all contribute to the technical crawlability of the site.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>What is SEM?</h3>\r\n<p>Rather than rely on organic content to boost your office’s website, you can also include search engine marketing in your strategy. This practice uses paid advertisements to make a site more visible on search engines.</p>\r\n<p>SEM often refers to paid-per-click advertising, which means you are only charged for the ad if the patient clicks on it. However, like SEO, keyword research is essential for ensuring a large number of high-quality leads encounter the ad.</p>\r\n<h2>How to utilize both SEO in and SEM in a campaign</h2>\r\n<p>Most marketing campaigns benefit from using a combination of SEO and SEM.

When that person leaves without<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/techniques-for-reducing-bounce-rate/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p>When people visit your website, you want them to stay for as long as possible. When that person leaves without exploring the site past the page originally clicked on, this is called a bounce. The bounce rate is calculated based on the number of people who exit your webpage before clicking on any of your other pages. The more people who leave prematurely, the higher your website’s bounce rate is.</p>\r\n<p>Higher bounce rates are bad for business because they mean fewer visitors are converting. Converting can involve completing any number of actions, such as sending a digital message, filling out the newsletter signup form, or buying a product. By decreasing bounce rate, you can increase your audience and business.</p>\r\n<h2>Ways to reduce bounce rate</h2>\r\n<p>A great bounce rate is around 30-50%, while a poor bounce rate can land above 80%. You can view your overall bounce rate and the bounce rate of specific pages on Google Analytics or another <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-alternatives/347638/#close\">analytic alternative</a>. Identifying which pages have the highest rate on your website can give you a specific area to focus on instead of trying to rework the content design and SEO strategy of your entire site at once. Here are changes you can make to a page to decrease bounce rate.</p>\r\n<h3>Make content easier to read</h3>\r\n<p>Large blocks of text are much harder to digest than text that is broken up and formatted to please the eye. Using subheadings, bullet points, images, charts, and occasional bolded keywords can make it easier for people to <a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\">scan your content</a> and find links to other pages. If you have various types of pages (blogs, articles, contact pages, etc.), create style guides for each that make sure all posts adhere to the right format and are easier to read.  </p>\r\n<h3>Employ strong calls to action</h3>\r\n<p>Experiment with calls to action to see what attracts readers to click on services you offer and engage more with your site. Some may stand stronger above the rest, and you may find that others do not receive as much attention. By establishing a powerful call to action, you entice visitors to sign up for newsletters and explore more parts of your site.</p>\r\n<h3>Improve usability</h3>\r\n<p>Your site should be appealing from the first second a visitor lands on it. Anything that looks clunky, jarring, or confusing is likely to lose newcomers quickly, and in an age when online attention spans last mere seconds, creating a captivating hook is essential. Double-check that your site is easy to navigate and that finding information is not a hassle. Your site should also be able to translate smoothly from any device and screen size. A majority of users browse the internet on a mobile device, so the last thing you want is a site that looks terrible on a small screen.</p>\r\n<h2>Reach out for more great ideas</h2>\r\n<p>Every website is different, and the creation of user-friendly, attractive pages should be tailored to individual business needs. Discover new ways to improve your site’s aesthetic and minimize bounce rate, and <a href=\"tel:877-477-2311\" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:877-477-2311\">contact us</a> to see how to change your site to fit the latest marketing trends.   </p>\r\n<p>Doctor Genius, located at 2 S Pointe Dr #200, Lake Forest, CA 92630, provides a range of services for practice success.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

As a result, many businesses do not meet the requirements set out by GMB and may not attract the attention they are seeking. To attain authority and trust, it is imperative to avoid the use of stock images, phone numbers, and addresses in a business’s signage.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Stock Photos Don’t Work </span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Stock photos are licensed images of common ideas or places that can reach across a wide variety of industries and do not provide individuality. Original photos rank higher as they grant consumers an accurate depiction of the place in which they are seeking care. According to </span><a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038063\"><span >Google My Business Help</span></a><span >, “Businesses that add photos to their Business Profiles receive 42% more requests for directions on Google Maps, and 35% more clicks through to their websites.” Original photos should be of high-quality, visually-appealing, and clear without the need to zoom in for clarity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >The more imagery provided, the more a business can be trusted. Businesses that rank the highest include photos with different angles and components of the storefront and signage. Proper storefront signage includes the name of the business and, at times, the street number of the listed address.</span></p>\r\n<p><span ><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2808 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Proper storefront signage - Zara Example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Zara_StoreFrontSignage_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></span></p>\r\n<h3><span >Phone Numbers and Addresses</span></h3>\r\n<p><span >Businesses with phone numbers in their signage are more likely to be flagged or unauthenticated by GMB as they are considered temporary. A phone number can always be changed, which would invalidate the business’s signage and require alteration. Signage, or storefront lettering, should only state the business name and, when necessary, the suite number.</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Addresses may be provided on the door but should not be visible in the business’s main photo. When taking a photo of the storefront or front door, ensure the phone number and address are left out. Businesses without a storefront, even in a business center or community building, should provide a photo of the physical door with the business name and suite number only. In this case, it may be a good idea to include a photo of the center’s directory with the practice name and suite number listed along with the physical door.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-2811  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront With Street Number\" width=\"401\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Storefront-With-Street-Number_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" />\r\n<h4>Storefront With Street Number</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<div>\r\n<h4><img class=\"wp-image-2810  alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg\" alt=\"Business Center Directory - Store Front Image\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Phone-Numbers-and-Addresses_Business-Center-Directory_ChildBlog-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" />\r\n<h4>Business Center Directory</h4>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><span >Solutions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >To ensure your business or practice ranks high on GMB and attracts consumers, original high-quality photos are of the utmost importance. Photos should be compressed to between 10 KB and 5 MB in either JPEG or PNG format to fit GMB guidelines. When magnified, photos should remain clear and easily readable. The photo should be free of distraction and focus on the subject matter alone (e.g., the door or the front desk).</span></p>\r\n<p><span >Businesses that operate in a business center or community building should provide images of the exterior and interior directories, including only their practice’s name and suite number. They must also provide a main photo of their front door with a clear sign, name card, or plaque that states their business name and suite number. Businesses with phone numbers or addresses on their storefronts must ensure these components are hidden from view in the images sent to GMB support to avoid being flagged.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"flex-table\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 32%; text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2821 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Protruding Hanging Business Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ProtrudingSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Protruding Sign</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"dryOut\" text-align: left;\"><img class=\" wp-image-2822 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Business Wall Sign\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_ClearSign_ChildBlog-177x118.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><span>Clear Sign</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"max-width:32%\"><img class=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Signage_MetalSign_ChildBlog-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Business Metal Sign\"/><span>Metal Plaque</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span >Business Center Directory</span></h2>\r\n<p><span >Doctor Genius works alongside the constantly changing Google algorithm to provide clients with the best outcomes.

The pandemic has forced many dentists to reconsider the future of their practices, pushing some to choose to retire or sell early. Although COVID-19 has caused many challenges for the dental industry, it has also created an opportunity for new dentists to start practices of their own. We welcome you to capitalize on the changing landscape by working with Doctor Genius, who can help you find a competitive advantage using digital marketing techniques. In fact, this week is a great time to prepare for the future by signing up for the </span><a href=\"https://event.webinarjam.com/register/22/voll3i0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Digital Marketing Landscape: Gaining a Competitive Advantage When it Counts Most</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinar.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s Impact on Dentistry</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19’s impact branches farther than simply causing dental practices to alter their methods or temporarily close their doors. The added pressure of social distancing requirements, new equipment needs, and sterilization protocols have led many dentists to make difficult decisions regarding the future of their practices. Now, many dentists are looking to sell their business or retire sooner than they had planned. New challenges can pave the way for new opportunities, and this unprecedented time offers young dentists the chance to start their own practice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it can seem daunting to start a practice during this pandemic, dentists can take advantage of some financial resources. Practice owners may be able to qualify for programs from the federal government’s $2-trillion stimulus, including the </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/dental-markets-whats-changing-today/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These programs can assist business owners in paying overhead expenses, employee wages, and rent/mortgage.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-COVID Digital Marketing </span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the onset of the pandemic, dentistry had entered the digital age, with digital marketing playing a vital role in reaching and communicating with target audiences. In the post-COVID dental landscape, understanding how to maximize a site’s reach and developing a sense of comfortability with a brand is paramount for practices. Digital marketing can be the source for maximizing your online presence and differentiating your brand. Since more people are finding their dentists online due to minimal personal contact, there is a shift to look online for trusted dentistry. Practices that integrate virtual health effectively have seen continual growth in their business. Our marketing solutions that have been most effective include fleshed out search engine and keyword optimization, social media and online engagement, digital advertising, and content marketing.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a fundamental part of digital marketing that can make a website more visible, driving more traffic and business opportunities. It is a valuable tool to help build brand awareness, grow relationships with clients, position yourself as a trusted authority in your field, and ultimately drive your business’s growth. Strategies to improve website and blog SEO include implementing well-researched keywords, relevant and educational content, external optimization practices, and local ranking tracking. Doctor Genius practice support can help you utilize the right SEO strategy, so you can improve your online presence and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right keywords is a crucial part of SEO, requiring careful selection and good judgment when including them in content. As a vital aspect of SEO that reaches and engages your audience, the form of content needs to be engaging, relevant, and shareable. External optimization practices or off-page SEO usually entails backlink building. This technique helps build authority as it lets search engines know that a website is valuable and high-quality. Local SEO is increasingly important for businesses, as many people use their mobile devices to search. Some best local SEO practices include claiming directory listings, using local keywords, and creating business pages on Google Maps, Google+, and Google My Business.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media and Online Engagement</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining an active social media presence helps keep businesses visible and top-of-mind. Social media platforms are an excellent place to communicate with current and prospective patients. Become a resource to serve your audience better and build stronger relationships with them. Post information that is valuable and engaging, sharing information that demonstrates expertise and displays thoughtful leadership. This will allow you to build trust and earn your audience’s confidence. Social media is a useful digital marketing tool to build your reputation and branding, helping you stand out from the competition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even during the uncertainty of the pandemic, patients are still engaging with dental practices online. It will remain important post-COVID for business owners to maintain direct lines of communication through online sources. Digital marketing allows practices to have an online voice and provide patients with timely responses, up-to-date information, and helpful tips. There are many ways for business owners to communicate with their audience, including social media, emails, and online messaging through their website. Doctor Genius figures out how, what, where, when, and to whom you need to be communicating and delivering your brand messages. It is crucial to leverage online communication to </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/how-to-communicate-with-patients-through-your-website/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retain current patients and establish relationships with prospective ones.</span></a></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses are investing in content creation, so it is important to create engaging, high-quality content that can break through the clutter and provide audiences with valuable information. Content marketing for medical practices can differentiate a dentist or medical practitioner as an expert in their field. Our digital marketing strategy will help you reach the right people and provide engaging content that encourages them to reach out. Providing consistent, educational, and accurate information can help boost your industry reputation and result in more people thinking of your practice when looking for a dentist.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a blog is one of the most effective ways to generate traffic to a website and connect with patients. Doctor Genius offers high-quality content writing to educate your audience while improving your practice’s ranking. This form of content marketing helps build brand awareness, communicate important information, attract new patients, and establish credibility. Blogging is important for boosting SEO as the addition of new content with the incorporation of the right keywords will help your practice rank higher on search engine result pages. The key to a blog’s success is consistency, so </span><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">setting up a blog schedule will help you remain one of the top contenders in your industry.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Blogs are a long-term tool for growth as blogs’ addition will drive website traffic and new patients over time.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are a powerful form of content marketing that can help differentiate a practice. You can create relevant and engaging video content that grabs your audience’s attention and addresses their interests and questions concisely and memorably. By optimizing videos for desktop and mobile formats, you help more people find and reach your site. Some video examples include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental education</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office tours</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient testimonials</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutorials targeting relevant keywords</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A sessions</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Advantage of the New Dental Landscape</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the changes that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 are here to stay.

It is important to embrace a digital marketing strategy that will support your business’s growth and success in the post-COVID landscape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dentists who retired or sold their businesses during the pandemic leave a gap for new dentists to fill.

By now, you probably already know that content is<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"/pillar-content-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it/\"> [ More.. ]</a>","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As search engines continue to evolve, so should your marketing strategy. By now, you probably already know that content is king. In today’s fast-paced world, the average consumer has more information at their fingertips than ever. They are knowledgeable, always looking for the best and most reliable products, services, and providers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, over time, search engines have become more and more complex. Consumers are using search differently, and search engine algorithms have shifted accordingly. Instead of limiting their search to keywords, consumers now “speak” more conversationally to search engines. In return, search engines have become better at predicting what searchers are looking for (and vice versa). This is where pillar content comes in.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Pillar Content</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evolution of inbound marketing has led to an influx of content. However, not all content is good content. Search engines look for reliable, quality work that contributes to the conversation. At the same time, readers wade through content by skimming through articles to find the best content. The structure of online content is so imperative that we released a blog on </span><a href=\"https://doctorgenius.com/blog/importance-of-writing-for-skimmers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing quality content for skimmers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a couple months ago. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar content is an easy way to establish authority on a given keyword or topic cluster. Google, which collectively controls 90% of the search market, prefers such clusters, built around a single pillar page. Pillar pages encompass all aspects of a topic with more in-depth blog posts. These blog posts hyperlink back to the pillar page, boosting the page’s overall linkability and search engine ranking.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Search Algorithms Affect Your Practice</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-has-changed-content-needs-to-evolve\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three major Google algorithm updates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you should keep in mind when considering your practice’s marketing strategy: Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. The Penguin algorithm update came out in early 2012 and penalized sites that were “keyword stuffing” or using other spam tactics. It preceded the Hummingbird algorithm update, which came out in mid-2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hummingbird algorithm update focused on translating readers’ inquires into meaningful results. Instead of searching for individual keywords, Google took users’ entire searches into context to direct them to the most relevant results. The RankBrain algorithm update, announced in late 2015, improved upon this even further by looking for pages with related keywords. Altogether, these three updates have made Google search more intuitive than ever.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, any successful content marketing strategy needs to understand a searcher’s intent while also predicting the keywords they are most likely to use. Of course, it can be tedious and time-consuming to think about every keyword variation your target consumer may use. Topic clusters allow you to provide quality content </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-page-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across multiple core topic areas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while also creating an efficient information architecture that will naturally boost your search engine rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctor Genius Content Packages</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Doctor Genius, we can take care of all your digital marketing needs — including any pillar content. As part of our broad spectrum of services, we offer two content packages: Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages. Both are designed to fit Google algorithms to organically boost your site’s credibility and rankings.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Content Ignition Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Ignition Packages can contain anywhere from 12 to 70 blog posts. These packages are focused on specific topics, such as tooth whitening or open enrollment. You can choose to deploy a blog post once a week or once every few months. Content Ignition Packages also include social media throws for optimal clickability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blog posts are contextual, meaning they are consistently adding content to any relevant service pages via blog snippets and internal linking. Each blog post will also link back to four other related blog posts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google will note these changes, along with any additional blog posts, each time they crawl the site. As such, the algorithm will view the site as “live” — producing consistent, relevant, and authoritative content. For example, a Content Ignition Package with 70 posts over six months will lead to 2.69 updates per week, not including any other blog posts you may add. Each blog post will include five links, adding up to a total of 350 internal links.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Keyword Content Packages Work</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Keyword Content Packages offer one hub topic page and four sub-pages. They also include six blog posts focused on each of the sub-pages’ topics, making for a total of 24 blog posts over a year. As such, Keyword Content Packages are best for practices that specialize in a single keyword or concept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to Content Ignition Packages, which offer many posts on many topics, Keyword Content Packages allow for in-depth writing on a single subject. It may help to think of a Keyword Content Package as an extension of your existing service pages and ongoing blogging to include five additional pages and 24 new blogs. This specialized approach gives you a competitive advantage for any searchers looking for knowledge on a niche topic, especially when deployed gradually.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Content Packages Matter</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to optimizing your digital marketing strategy, overhauling your website is just the beginning. Since Google prioritizes relevant results, each new site will see a considerable rankings boost once it goes live. After all, most websites are approved with hundreds of pages of authoritative content.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with relying on these initial results is that they will eventually stagnate, even with monthly blog posts — especially if competitors target refresh their webpage content all at once or post more frequently or new websites continue to emerge. Both the Content Ignition Packages and Keyword Content Packages build on your site’s existing information architecture with valuable, comprehensive, and relevant content.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Started Today</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our content packages can help your practice establish and maintain an authoritative web presence, so you can focus on treating your patients.
